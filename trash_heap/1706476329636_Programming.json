The problem is that it's impossible to write functions that work fine either way.Think about data transformation functions that take an input like `sort` or `findBest` or `join` or whatever. You can't (in a simple way) have the same function take an input that's either a synchronous value or a Promise (or hey, maybe even an Array<Promise>). If you want a version that works on promises then usually you'd write a 2nd version of the same function that is async. But conceptually the function is doing the same thing and maybe we'd be more productive if the one function could work fine either way. That's the problem.Also a function like that doesn't need to \"signal to the programmer that something effectful is probably happening inside that code\" because that isn't true. Being async doesn't imply that it's effectful.","If you've spent some time in online programming circles, you've likely heard it said that JavaScript's promises are monads or that they are monadic. While a quick Google search reveals that this is not quite true, it is kind of trueFor some context: The promise devs were asked to make the promises actually monadic and shat all over the idea because they were scared of the word monad.https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec/issues/94","The big difference between Haskell and C# here is that in Haskell, you can write code that's polymorphic with respect to \"color.\" That is, instead of hard-coding IO into your type signature, you can use a type variable Monad m and have the same code work for any monadic effect (including the identity effect).","There's two \"colors\" of side-effects:Effects that persist after the run of the program (like writing to the disk or database) andEffects that destructively modify internal data-structures in memory while the program is running (such as modifying the value of a field in some data-structure).Talking about IO seems to me to focus on the externally persistent side-effects. Does the conclusions and advise of this article apply similarly to in-memory side-effects?In other words is the best practice that whenever we modify the value of some field we should wrap that operation into a Promise?","I also like having this information in the type system. Also, the common criticism that you can't call async functions from non-async functions (in a blocking way) is JS exclusive. C# for example has a .wait method on its Task objects.(And strictly speaking, even JS can call async functions in a blocking way using SharedArrayBuffer and a Mutex)","I think the author kinda misses the point:While the desire of wanting to know if a function has (side-)effects, splitting the whole ecosystem is a price way too high.","Also, Dude, \"colored function\" is not the preferred nomenclature, \"temporally identified\", please.","that argument is completely moot in js where type is not a thing you can rely on. also, i just need await in non-async functions. still don't see why i can't do that."],"points":102},{"text":["Computational Thinking for Problem Solving By University of Pennsylvania"],"points":0},{"text":["Simple tricks to level up your technical design docs","Nice.

The thing is that most of these image formats are better (image size / quality), but they lack broad support.","Solid article. Here are some additional details that might be relevant:While both formats support lossless, AVIF's lossless mode is very bad. Worse than WebP lossless and sometimes even worse than PNG. JXL lossless is the best available (although browser support is limited, unfortunately, so you'd still need a WebP and/or PNG fallback).While JXL animated mode exists, and compresses better than GIF, it still has the same fundamental issue of animated GIF: you are using an image format to store video. It's almost always better to use an actual video file (even with an old codec like H.264), as those can efficiently represent only the differences between consecutive frames instead of storing each frame independently.JXL has a unique feature which is that, in a special mode, it can recompress an existing JPEG file with no quality loss (with any other format, you would either use lossy mode and get worse quality, or use lossless mode and produce a bigger file than the JPEG). The resulting JXL file can be decoded into pixels by anything that supports JXL, or it can also be decoded into a byte-for-byte identical copy of the original JPEG file. Useful if you have a big collection of JPEGs and don't want to compromise on quality.","AVIF would be a lot better if it wasn't literally broken in GIMP. GIMP is using Nearest Neighbor interpolation to upscale the chroma planes, making it look like total üí©.Try this out, save a color picture in GIMP as an AVIF, then load it again. Use Decompose to convert the color to Y, Cb, and Cr planes. Then just look at the three planes.Worst part is they refuse to fix this because \"They're fixing it for the upcoming 2.99 branch instead\" and do not consider it important enough to fix in the stable branch.","I have added *.jxl as an upgrade to existing *jpg and *.png images using <picture> and the results are phenomenal:JXL is 20-30% smaller for *.jpg files without any loss in quality.JXL is 80% smaller for *.png files (largely logos with text) without any perceptible change in the picture."],"points":4},{"text":["Developers experience burnout, but 70% of them code on weekends","Coding is the fun part.

So you had poor programmers / system designers putting in place restrictive rules about where one could place whitespace and comments, even, and imparing productivity with useless, backwards PR \"reviews\", while churning out reams of poorly-performing, buggy code themselves underlings were afraid to honestly review. Deadline after missed deadline, robots crashing headon into each other, and still some of these anti-programmers who were darlings of superiors were allowed to continue for political reasons.For many, programming on side projects is an outlet where they can let all the stress go, and make things which are truly high-quality.
