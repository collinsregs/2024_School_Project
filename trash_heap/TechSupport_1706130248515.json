You've crossed that hurdle.As for 'your power bill', we're talking about energy efficiency. It's my intuition that there is a degree of energy lost to heat in charging the laptop battery and then discharging it. If it doesn't have a battery, then it's basically just passing through the electricity after doing all the normal conversions (although, it would convert 240V AC to some pd as DC, then down to 5V somewhere on the motherboard, but I don't know how different that is to 240V AC down to 5V in one go). As for any more inefficiencies, we're talking about the resistence of wires, which isn't very much.Although this all changes if your laptop is actually running, even in sleep mode (keeping the RAM powered), and using a baseline of energy.
