This efficiency ultimately saves time and resources for the company. Explain that maintaining messy code requires more time and effort, leading to higher costs in the long run. By investing in cleanup now, they can reduce ongoing maintenance expenses. Highlight the importance of addressing security vulnerabilities in the codebase.

How critical is the data for UI function?If the missing item can simply be excluded, then do that. An example would be a news carousel where the user would not even know if the story exists if it's simply removed.If the user is expecting that item to load because they want it, but it isn't critical for UI function, then a message should display notifying the user, ideally with some kind of potential resolution such as \"try again.\" An example would be a weather widget as a slide in the carousel. In this case, the slide would exist, but with a nicely styled message.If the missing data is required for a crucial part of the app, then a message should be returned instead of a carousel, along with an appropriate status code that describes the state of the request. An example here is more difficult to describe, because you shouldn't be putting globally crucial data in a carousel.As for the 500 vs 200 return, in this case return a 200. The reason is, you still want to render what's available, and any non-200 code is telling the browser not to render the payload as expected.That said, in other cases its a common bad practice to return a 200 even when there's an error. Don't return a 200 with an error of access denied, for instance. But if you want to render the data returned, even partially, a 200 is the best option.As for the notification that the vendor is failing, this should happen on the backend. If there is info that is relevant for the user, sure display a message there that helps them. But your notifications and problem detection should happen on the backend.","As an alternative, could you do some validation/error handling on the front end to just move on to the next file if an error occurs? I'm no expert, but that seems easier that modifying the API return codes to give 200 even when the file is missing.","If you're getting a list back, the request itself was a 200, but perhaps each item in the list should also include a status. This assumes that the API knows if an image will fail to load though. For example, maybe the data the API is reading is/was correct, but something happened on the CDN's side, like someone moving the image for whatever reason.The UI should be validating the API response in any case, especially if you're dealing with a request from a third party. Even then, the browser has to make an additional request for the image itself, which would return a response agnostic of the API, so the carousel could have recovered gracefully in either case."],"points":7},{"text":["How to deal with initial data needed for a new feature in my app?","Here's my recommended approach. Create a database migration script to add the initial data to the required tables. This script should be part of your codebase and executed automatically during the deployment process. This ensures that the necessary data is added consistently across all environments. If the initial data is static and not expected to change frequently, you can include it as seed data in your Django project. Django provides mechanisms for managing initial data through fixtures or custom management commands (which i'm sure you're aware of). This data can be easily loaded into the database during deployment. Before deploying to production, test the migration script and the new feature thoroughly in your testing environment. This ensures that the data is added correctly and the feature functions as expected. As you've already done, use a feature flag to control access to the new feature until the initial data is in place. This allows you to deploy the update without impacting users until you're ready. If you decide to manually add the data in your development environment and then export/import tables, ensure that you have a reliable backup of your production database before making any changes. This minimizes the risk of data loss or corruption. Always have a rollback plan in place in case something goes wrong during deployment. This includes reverting the database schema and data changes if necessary. Overall, the key is to automate the process of adding initial data as much as possible and thoroughly test it in a controlled environment before deploying to production. This ensures a smooth rollout of the new feature without disrupting the user experience.

There are online editors like this one."],"points":1},{"text":["What tech stack can and should I use (for my own sites and experiments; on all-inkl.com)","PayloadCMS is only compatible with MongoDB (document database) and Postgres (SQL database like MySQL but support is in beta). I use Postgres with Payload and haven't run into any major issues.XAMPP still exists (and isn't really recommended anymore), but if you're using Payload, you'll need Node to run it and can use Node for local development as well. Look into Payload's templates for an all-in-one CMS and frontend solution.","When it comes to compatibility, whatever software platform you choose should fully support whatever your hosting provider offers. This both programming language, and database ond their versions. If you're running javascript on the server, your host needs to support nodejs.Depending on your goals, you might not need a full CMS. Adding complexity means learning more. Installing & upgrading the software, database as well as addressing any issues that come up isn't always straight forward. If your goal is to learn a specific programming language or platform, you're better off choosing a web host can support the platform you wan to learn. If you're just looking to make a portfolio and do some front end development/experimenting, try looking to simplifying your platform. Some options for this may include:Use purely static website (i.e. html, css, & js). For this you don't even need to set up any software at home. Just open / reload the html when developing and upload the files to your server when you're done.Ditch the database, and use a flat file cms. In a flat file cms, the data is stored in files rather than in the database. You only need to install the cms, and upload the static files containing the content / customizations to your webhost. There should be PHP based flat file cms' that's supported on your webhost.","I use XAMPP, but you can also use MAMP if you're on a Mac..."],"points":2},{"text":["I have to setup a new front-end workflow, but I can't run the one that I used years ago.

I would start with relational databases as they teach fundamentals that nosql trades for other benefits","Learn SQL and relational database design. It‚Äôs the tool for the job 99% of times. NoSql is attractive to newbies because ‚Äúhey no need to learn SQL‚Äù and for most of your hobby projects it will work just fine, however as data increases and relationships get more complex, it becomes apparent that NoSQL databases were not designed for this use case. And I can almost guarantee that all if not almost all your project ideas have relational data. NoSQL is GREAT when used for the job it was designed for, it‚Äôs just that most projects don‚Äôt need it.¬†Then the personal benefit is that well most projects use SQL so you‚Äôll feel more comfortable joining a new team, and thus it is a more marketable skill.","Non relational databases tend to be for more specific purposes where a relational model isn't a good fit. MySQL these days is pretty solid and you should do fine with it.","Learning SQL was allways beneficial.","The choice isn't up to you. You want to know how the data is stored that may be interesting for you and then learn the tools. My suggestion is to get in touch with an engineer and ask him about it, also ask about advice how to safely navigate the data.","RDBMS (SQL/MySQL/etc) - the other one is bullshit","I'd argue that NoSQL is easier to start with. You just dump your somewhat structured data into the DB and can start querying. No need to look into foreign key relationships and all of that. If you go with an ORM you can also achieve something similar with relational DBs though.In the end you'd need to get familiar with either one of the paradigms and it's mainly a matter of personal taste."],"points":43},{"text":["High Quality Open-Source Software for Web Developers","Dailydev looks cool, just signed up.","That post in question mentions Tanstack router.

Their internal routing is nice to keep latencies low between services.
