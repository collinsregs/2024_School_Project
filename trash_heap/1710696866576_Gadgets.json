[{"text":["VR Headsets Are Approaching the Eye’s Resolution Limits","I'm glad the article touched on the many other important properties of VR equipment beyond just resolution. In a way, hitting high enough resolution to reach the limit of human perception is a good thing. Now that aspect can plateau so R&D can focus on other areas. HDR / OLED optiona and other improvements to the image itself, FOV, FPS, Foveated Rendering, heat reduction, reduced power consumption, cost savings of manufacturing, etc....And thats just the screen hardware. There's a lot of room for improvement and just general advancement in other hardware and software that drives those displays. Wired/ wireless standards also improve for data transfer where needed. We're getting better SoCs every year on smaller process nodes. There's a bright future ahead as long as there's both cutting edge models and budget friendly consumer models that offer compelling productivity and entertainment options that people actually want.Edit: I totally agree with the suspicion as well. With quality upscalers and better hardware of native resolution, there may be ways higher resolution still can improve visual perception once the pixels and screen door effect are behind us.","Until they find a way to improve said eye’s resolution limits >:)","VR headsets sit right up next to your face. This isn’t an 8K TV sitting 10 feet away. You’ll notice the pixels and more importantly you’ll notice the aberrations from the pancaked lenses.","As if there is powerful enough current hardware capable of rendering decent graphics in those resolutions.","Ready for my direct optic nerve input. Hook me up. Plug me in. Let’s go.","That's what they said about sound and fps for the longest time","When it comes to human limits there is no magic number, it's more of a spectrum. You can't say \"Ok, we have reached 14000ppi. Anything above is useless because you couldn't tell the difference. 13000ppi is dogshit and 15000 is overkill\".Chances are, you will still notice the difference in an extremely subtle way that isn't really worth it. Call it diminishing returns.It's like with iPhone's Retina screen: 400ppi is theoretically the limit your eyes can discern the pixels from your typical smartphone viewing distance, but if you pick up an Xperia with 800ppi you'll feel the difference. But obviously, a 4K screen on a smartphone is a resource hog so diminishing returns kick in and it stops being worth it.I see it more as Bell curve than a hard single point limit.","That’s what people said about refresh rate a few years ago…","No they’re not.","They said this about the iPhone 4 lol","Good. Hopefully they can make it affordable now","Good, now they can focus on lighter headsets with longer battery life. 🤷🏽‍♂️","New VR gear, replace your eyes.","Do I interpret this correctly- that in the future VR footage/animation won’t have to portray things a certain length away anymore or.","i thought it was at the point that we get either 30K or 60K per eye though","The last one I saw still had a screen door effect....I don't think it's there yet. I'll have to see the apple vision pro. But I'm not that impressed yet.","I’m anticipating affordable gear that brings the visual field past my peripheral vision and so get even more immersive!","Power saving and form factor. If it’s too big it’s gonna give you a headache. And if it eats battery it’s not fun to use.Fix those first","Tell me when the FoV is wide enough that I don't feel like I'm in a fish tank","No they aren’t, not even close.Edit: I thought I’d give the article the benefit of the doubt and try to actually read it instead of just responding to the headline, and the very first thing is this:But here’s the real surprise: TCL’s new TV isn’t the most pixel-dense or exotic display ever produced.Wow, really? You’re telling me the least pixel-dense 4K TV ever produced isn’t the most pixel-dense display ever produced? What an unbelievably stupid article.","Oh cool. I’ve only seen this claim consistently for 20 years about various technologies","no they aren't, in that there's a lot to go still.otherwise of course they are, wtf else would they do....","No, they aren’t. 😂","This is awesome can't wait to program in vr","All VR and AR headsets still cause serious balance and nausea issues which seem to persist despite extensive efforts to resolve them.What's it matter how far they extend this tech if it just makes most people puke and fall over?"],"points":271}]
