In a way, hitting high enough resolution to reach the limit of human perception is a good thing. Now that aspect can plateau so R&D can focus on other areas. HDR / OLED optiona and other improvements to the image itself, FOV, FPS, Foveated Rendering, heat reduction, reduced power consumption, cost savings of manufacturing, etc....And thats just the screen hardware. There's a lot of room for improvement and just general advancement in other hardware and software that drives those displays. Wired/ wireless standards also improve for data transfer where needed. We're getting better SoCs every year on smaller process nodes. There's a bright future ahead as long as there's both cutting edge models and budget friendly consumer models that offer compelling productivity and entertainment options that people actually want.Edit: I totally agree with the suspicion as well. With quality upscalers and better hardware of native resolution, there may be ways higher resolution still can improve visual perception once the pixels and screen door effect are behind us.","Ready for my direct optic nerve input. Hook me up. Plug me in. Let’s go.","Until they find a way to improve said eye’s resolution limits >:)","As if there is powerful enough current hardware capable of rendering decent graphics in those resolutions.","VR headsets sit right up next to your face. This isn’t an 8K TV sitting 10 feet away. You’ll notice the pixels and more importantly you’ll notice the aberrations from the pancaked lenses.","Which ones have reached our resolution limit?The consumer devices I’ve used (the expensive ‘gaming’ ones), have all been weak on resolution and gaps between pixels. Especially ones using fresnel lenses.","That's what they said about sound and fps for the longest time","Foveated rendering is absolutely where focus should be because VR requirements exceed GPU computing limits and always will be ahead of flat screen market. There’s a huge amount of wasted computing power as human vision is a lot worse than we actually think. Statically, your eyes have massive blind and burry areas right in front of you, and the only reason you don’t “see” it is because you move your eyes constantly and your brain fills in the rest. It’s not even difficult to map out per person, and if you did you could render even less in the areas you’re looking at, and even worse in the areas you have actual blind spots.","Tell me when the FoV is wide enough that I don't feel like I'm in a fish tank","No they’re not.","When it comes to human limits there is no magic number, it's more of a spectrum. You can't say \"Ok, we have reached 14000ppi. Anything above is useless because you couldn't tell the difference. 13000ppi is dogshit and 15000 is overkill\".Chances are, you will still notice the difference in an extremely subtle way that isn't really worth it. Call it diminishing returns.It's like with iPhone's Retina screen: 400ppi is theoretically the limit your eyes can discern the pixels from your typical smartphone viewing distance, but if you pick up an Xperia with 800ppi you'll feel the difference. But obviously, a 4K screen on a smartphone is a resource hog so diminishing returns kick in and it stops being worth it.I see it more as Bell curve than a hard single point limit.","No they aren’t, not even close.Edit: I thought I’d give the article the benefit of the doubt and try to actually read it instead of just responding to the headline, and the very first thing is this:But here’s the real surprise: TCL’s new TV isn’t the most pixel-dense or exotic display ever produced.Wow, really? You’re telling me the least pixel-dense 4K TV ever produced isn’t the most pixel-dense display ever produced? What an unbelievably stupid article. I guess I don’t actually need to read it after all to know that it’s nonsense.","New VR gear, replace your eyes.","The limit of the human eye differs when dealing with a static image vs a moving one. So for example maybe you can trick the eye with a static 8k image, but if theyre using vr and running about in-game, you also need the highest possible framerate and the best possible stability. There is no use making high resolution goggles when games are so behind in these other areas.","Well I guess they will just have to update human vision next? 😬","Wtf do you mean resolution limits? We don't see the world in terms of pixels, resolution is a term that applies to images, not human vision.","They said this about the iPhone 4 lol","Oh cool. I’ve only seen this claim consistently for 20 years about various technologies","Good, now they can focus on lighter headsets with longer battery life. 🤷🏽‍♂️","Do I interpret this correctly- that in the future VR footage/animation won’t have to portray things a certain length away anymore or.","I’m anticipating affordable gear that brings the visual field past my peripheral vision and so get even more immersive!","VR needs to focus on hand tracking and removing controllers. Nothing says immersion like holding a clearly circular piece of plastic while the screen shows you holding a shield and sword.","Are there VR headsets that are on par with the Vision Pro yet?","It's pretty arbitrary since we can kinda see more. Yeah I think 8k per eye at 120° viewing angle should be good enough even for reading text. I have a hard time thinking just what sort of monster GPU can crank out 90fps at 2x8k. ?10 4090's?","Soooo, Porn still doesn’t look great yet? When should buy?","Neat, almost time to buy one.","S","Next, they should do helmets! Bigger screens, surround sound stuff. In fact, maybe they do? I’m not really keeping up… Added feature, running into stuff will be less of a worry!","They should approach more affordable prices","What a silly headline. Reading the article the issue is not that we’re nearing “eye resolution limit” but instead the hardware limitations of how closely we can pack pixels. Will our current limits look better than the previous limits? Yes. Will we finally be rid of the screen-door effect? Debatable.","Here we go again......... unless they're getting close to 16k resolution in each eye (and they're not), then no, they're not \"GETTING CLOSE TO THE EYE'S RESOLUTION LIMITS!!!\". Fucking dumbass pseudoscience bullshit from people that don't know what they're talking about. Probably the same people that say you can't see any difference over 60 fps. Bodies do not work that way, good night!Each fucking eyeball has like a hundred million photoreceptors in it. at 16k resolution you've basically guaranteed a pixel per light-cone in the eye. That's our \"resolution limit\". Show me hardware that can run 16k resolution, let alone in VR headset format. Go on, I'll wait. And you'll fucking wait too, at least 10 years.And what about the tech on the bleeding edge right now of interfacing with our nervous system directly? What then? Fuck the eyes, the next bottleneck will be how much and how fast our brains can handle.","This is awesome can't wait to program in vr","I really hope media at resolutions that exceeds what the human eye can see doesn't catch on, at least as a new \"standard\" that everyone decides to insert into everything.For one thing, I don't feel like being forced to waste money on hardware just to unnecessarily inflate pixel counts, when art direction almost uniformly makes a far bigger difference to whether something looks good or not.For another, for me even 4K often creates an uncanny feel when not used well. (so, most of the time)It's one thing if I'm watching a nature documentary about insects, and you see a ladybug interacting with a dew drop on a leaf in insane detail you'd never be able to see in real life, no matter how close you'd get.It's another thing entirely when it's a shot of couple of people playing out a dramatic scene, but you can see every pore and wisp of hair on their cheeks, as if you were an invisible observer creepily watching them from inches away. (unless the director was explicitly going for that effect, but it's virtually never the case) Or there's a wide shot of some vista, and it feel artificial because distant objects are unnaturally sharp. And never mind the way it often magnifies flaws in set design or VFX. Not everything is improved by watching it through a microscope. (or a high-res telescope)","That’s what people said about refresh rate a few years ago…","This article really glosses over timelines when talking about \"approaches\". You can plot out current headsets using the Wikipedia data. MicroLED is the technology to get us there, but it requires brand new foundries and billions in investment. It'll go from 4K -> 8K -> 16K which is a process. So the 16K per eye headsets are closer to 2040 for a cheap headset people are imagining.",""],"points":865}]
