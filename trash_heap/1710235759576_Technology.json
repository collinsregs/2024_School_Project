Last year, 14 per cent of restaurateurs in the United States said that they had invested in technology that replaced an employee in 2023. Much of the automation is in quick-service restaurants. In full-service restaurants, diners still expect to be greeted by humans. But in QSRs, efficiency rules. For these restaurants, revenue has grown over the past year, while for the rest of the dining industry it has shrunk. While all restaurants have benefitted from the automation of taking reservations, managing inventory, and processing orders, QSRs are able phase out whole job categories.The purely physical versions of new restaurant tech ‚Äî sweetly named restaurant robots that make tortilla chips (Chipotle‚Äôs Chippy) or French fries (White Castle‚Äôs Flippy) ‚Äî are children‚Äôs toys compared to the AI-powered software in today‚Äôs order-taking kiosks. The technology inside these kiosks is able to adjust pricing, promote specials, and customize the menu‚Äôs presentation in real time. The goal is not merely to automate a previously human job, but also to improve performance by increasing the average bill size and ordering frequency.‚Ä¶If the restaurant app companies successfully frame the issue as a benefit to consumers, they‚Äôll succeed where the vending machines got caught with their robot mandibles in the cookie jar. They‚Äôre not asking to invade our privacy. They‚Äôre offering to optimize our experience!There won‚Äôt be a referendum on this issue. Our governments are always streets behind the speed of the tech industry. Within a year, once enough of us have clicked away our expectation of privacy in exchange for 15 per cent off on our next order, this conversation may be over.It‚Äôs been fairly well known for a while now that many people are more than happy to trade away their privacy and/or security online in exchange for what are effectively baubles and trinkets.
