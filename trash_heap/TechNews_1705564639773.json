Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[6][7] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.","All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....","Wait, you actually opened the comments?
