Most software has bugs in it, often important ones that give wrong answers, lead to data being stolen, or lead to sums not adding up.The problem is that, when the Post Office learned that their expensive software rollout wasn't working... they responded by accusing the people running the offices as fraud. When the people blamed the system, the Post Office investigators told them that no-one else had reported bugs like these. The investigators repeated those lines to hundreds of people over more than a decade - despite the investigations being run and reviewed by a relatively small group of people, who must have known those statements were untrue.Then the Post Office management took these people to court, and continued to lie, and got hundreds of them convicted of fraud based on evidence many of the Post Office investigators and management must have known to be untrue.The scandal isn't buggy software - it's the dishonest investigations and prosecutions, that appear to have started simply from being too embarrased to admit that a software rollout was an expensive mistake.Fujitsu should be held to account not for their lack of quality control, but rather for supporting these prosecutions and providing witness statements that they knew were misleadingly incomplete; for seeing what was happening and staying silent; for helping their customer get away with this when they had the knowledge to expose the Post Office management's lies.","Nobody with money and power will ever be prosecuted, no matter how egregious the crime.","Stealing chip designs from Crey to blackmail, Fujitsu has always been a shady company."],"points":30},{"text":["Taiwan EV battery maker ProLogium eyes mass production in France in 2027"],"points":0},{"text":["Reviewers begin testing GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER, first benchmarks spotted","Practically the same GPU as the OG 4080 but the $200 price cut is nice even without the nominal 5% performance boost."],"points":0},{"text":["Microsoft Hits $3 Trillion Value, Cementing Strength of AI Rally","Given the massive amount of speculative value AI is being given by investors, I question how effectively generative AI will be monetized.

The bipedal bot, which is simply dubbed the ‚ÄúFigure 01,‚Äù stands 5'6\" tall, weighs 130 pounds, and has five-fingered hands that the company claims can be used to physically construct objects. On its YouTube channel, Figure has a video of the robot making coffee.

The related press release speaks of the ‚Äúdeployment of humanoid robots in an automotive manufacturing environment‚Äù and claims the robots will focus on ‚Äúdifficult, unsafe, or tedious tasks,‚Äù all of which sounds pretty vague.The press release further states that, as part of the first phase of the deal, the two companies will work together to ‚Äúidentify initial use cases to apply the Figure robots in automotive production.‚Äù Again, the wording here sorta makes it sound like both companies are a bit unclear on what the robots will actually be doing. After the two firms finally agree on what the Figure 01 can do, some of the bots will be deployed to one of BMW‚Äôs manufacturing facilities in Spartanburg, South Carolina....Tech companies throughout the world are currently in a race to churn out the first generation of ‚Äúhumanoid‚Äù robots. While robots have helped out in factories and warehouses for years, the human form factor of this newer iteration of robots is thought to have many added benefits for more complicated forms of industrial work.

Figure‚Äôs CEO has claimed that his company has no interest in taking jobs away from people‚Äîwhich is, of course, what he would say.Wishy-washy press releases aside, from a technical perspective it will be interesting to see what these humanoid robots are capable of, especially in a more general sense; but from a social side it's clear that this has the potential to negatively impact the lives of many people."],"points":4},{"text":["I made a puzzle game where YOU design a puzzle and AI solves it.

Amazon France Logistique employs around 20,000 staff in France.The practice labelled as illegalThe watchdog said Amazon's French company had put in place scanners for its workers, to document in real-time how long it took to carry out certain tasks.This meant that, in certain situations, employees being monitored by the scanners potentially had to justify the breaks they were taking.Another mode of surveillance looked at the time workers took to quality-check articles, with the target set at a minimum window of 1.25 seconds.If the time allocated fell below the threshold, Amazon considered the check to be insufficient.The watchdog also found that Amazon's practices breached the EU's general data protection regulation (GDPR) which imposes strict rules on companies for obtaining consent on how personal information is used.The CNIL considered it was excessive that Amazon kept all data collected by the system for all employees and temporary workers for a 31-day period.Amazon reserves the right to appealReacting to the decision, Amazon said in a statement, it \"strongly disagrees with the CNIL's conclusions which are factually incorrect\", adding it reserved the right to appeal.Amazon had argued the use of warehouse management systems was standard industry practice and its systems complied with applicable European and French regulations.The tech giant also noted it had worked constructively with the CNIL throughout the procedure to respond to the questions raised.The tech giant is known for its stringent standards in the world of e-commerce, asking workers to deliver packages in 24 hours.Amazon says such efficiency would be impossible without the use of the scanners, as it aims to move tens of thousands of items constantly whilst also ensuring minimum quality standards.It is not the first time Amazon has faced serious backlash in France.

Not because of the price hikes or password crackdowns, but the lack of quality content. 2024 Netflix kind of feels like 2024 Amazon to me‚Ä¶ hollow and watered down‚Ä¶established brands/IP migrating away, to be replaced with a sea of cheap knockoffs.","It‚Äôs hard to believe. Netflix genuinely doesn‚Äôt have good content.I find myself spending 30min paging through options and watching the short previews, without actually selecting something to watch, and then switching to another source altogether.","I left and paid for 1 month to watch British baking and cancelled.

I think there's still value compared to other services, and my wife loves Gilmore Girls.I still find things to watch, so I'm not feeling like it's a waste.I just think people unfortunately have to accept that all these services will nickel and dime, find ways to slip in ads, and obviously not let people share their passwords all over.I am curious how many though get free Netflix from another service...like their cell phone service? I know T-Mobile offers free Hulu, Netflix, and Apple TV+ to its customers...so that might be a factor.","Good for Netflix. However, I found myself far happier pirating the content that I like from them :)","Wait.

We're barely a spec.","Why are there rumors about another price increase this year then?","I downgraded from the highest tier to the lowest tier. But now it‚Äôs cheap so I guess I don‚Äôt care their content is crap","Maybe because subscriptions automatically started back up all by themselves like mine did.

See what happens‚Ä¶","Trevor Long for Nine:‚Ä¢ Australia's second-largest telco, Optus, has admitted today that almost 2700 calls to triple zero simply didn't work during their national service outage on November 8 last year.‚Ä¢ Until today, that number was 228, a number given by Optus executives to a Senate hearing late last year, and while over 200 people being unable to call emergency services is a troubling statistic, it gets worse today as that number increases more than ten-fold.‚Ä¢ The telco now says that an \"additional 2468 customers that made triple zero calls from our network did not reach the emergency service centre and for which a welfare check was not undertaken\", putting the total figure at 2697.Leonie Thorne and Loretta Florance for ABC:‚Ä¢ The update comes after documents obtained by the ABC revealed that the telco, the federal government and the telecommunications regulator knew customers were having problems calling triple-0 from their mobiles for hours before the public was informed.‚Ä¢ The federal government confirmed that Optus had advised the information it previously provided to the Senate, the public and the regulator was \"not accurate\".‚Ä¢ \"This is a deeply concerning development given the critical importance of the Triple Zero service,\" Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said in a statement."],"points":4},{"text":["Hinkley Point C could be delayed to 2031 and cost up to ¬£35bn, says EDF","The American version was in Georgia that came online in 2023.Two nuclear reactors in Georgia were supposed to herald a nuclear power revival in the United States. But the project is seven years late and $17 billion over budget as Georgia Power Co.They're currently projected to cost Georgia Power and three other owners $31 billion, according to Associated Press calculations. Add in $3.7 billion that original contractor Westinghouse paid the Vogtle owners to walk away from construction, and the total nears $35 billion.","The owner of Hinkley Point C has blamed inflation, Covid and Brexit as it announced the nuclear power plant project could be delayed by a further four years, and cost ¬£2.3bn more.The plant in Somerset, which has been under construction since 2016, is now expected to be finished by 2031 and cost up to ¬£35bn, France‚Äôs EDF said. However, the cost will be far higher once inflation is taken into account, because EDF is using 2015 prices.‚ÄãThe latest in a series of setbacks represents a huge delay to the project‚Äôs initial timescale. In 2007, the then EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz said that by Christmas in 2017, turkeys would be cooked using electricity generated from atomic power at Hinkley. When the project was finally given the green light in 2016, its cost was estimated at ¬£18bn.‚ÄúLike other major infrastructure projects, we have found civil construction slower than we hoped and faced inflation, labour and material shortages, on top of Covid and Brexit disruption,‚Äù said Stuart Crooks, the project‚Äôs managing director, in a message to staff.","It staggers me the decline of the UK.
