I already asked AI how to prevent school shootings:Preventing school shootings is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach, including policy changes, community engagement, and individual action. Here are several strategies that can contribute to prevention:Enhanced School Security: Implementing security measures such as controlled entry points, security cameras, and on-site security personnel can help deter potential threats.Early Intervention Programs: Identifying and providing support for individuals who show signs of distress or violent behavior can prevent escalations. Schools can implement programs that teach conflict resolution, stress management, and emotional regulation.Comprehensive Mental Health Support: Increasing access to mental health resources for students and staff can address underlying issues that contribute to violent behavior. Schools can provide on-site mental health professionals and facilitate connections to community resources.Safe School Environment: Creating a supportive and inclusive school culture can reduce bullying and alienation, which are risk factors for violent behavior. Schools can implement anti-bullying programs and promote values of respect and kindness.Responsible Gun Ownership: Advocating for laws and policies that ensure responsible gun ownership and restrict access to firearms by individuals who pose a risk can help prevent school shootings. This includes background checks, safe storage laws, and red flag laws.Community Engagement: Encouraging collaboration between schools, law enforcement, mental health organizations, and community members can foster a united front against potential threats. Community members can be trained to recognize and report concerning behavior.Threat Assessment Teams: Schools can establish multidisciplinary teams to assess potential threats and determine appropriate interventions. These teams can include educators, administrators, law enforcement officers, and mental health professionals.Training and Drills: Regularly conducting active shooter drills and training for students and staff can prepare them to respond effectively in an emergency. However, it's important to balance this with the potential psychological impact of such drills.Preventing school shootings is a societal challenge that requires cooperation and commitment from individuals, communities, and policymakers alike. By implementing these strategies, we can work towards creating safer school environments for all children.","Every other so-called AI is FUBAR.¬† Now let us humans see how horribly this one can fuck it up."],"points":9},{"text":["Year of Linux on the desktop creeps closer as market share rises a little","\"The Year of the Linux Desktop\" has been next Year since 1998.But I guess if you count Android etc as Linux and are generous enough with your definition of \"Desktop\" to include things like ChromeBooks, we might be getting closer.Maybe another quarter of a century and we will be there.","The figures are skewed due to the huge surge in popularity of Linux in India.","I'm not going to bother to read the article.

I have a PhD , 15 years experience at startups and top tier big tech places, have won awards, published a book, and taught university CS for years.Almost every single interview has been the same:Recruiting screen.Coding screen.Several-hour take home project, like building a full stack web app with persistence, an API, a react front end, etc. Must be on GitHub and run with docker compose. Must be written in golang or whatever.1 hour presentation about the architecture of said take home project, with 30 mins of q and a. Must include test coverage visualizations, discussions of alternatives, tradeoffs, and \"lessons learned\".4-6 hours of virtual onsite, including much more challenging coding (leetcode stuff usually), system architecture (design Uber or whatever), and a bunch of behavioral stuff (tell me about a time when...)Then if you make it through ALL THAT, they want you to block out three days so you can fly to HQ and do a full day actual onsite.This has all been for remote work. At companies no one has EVER heard of, ever.I don't expect anyone to take my resume at face value, or not do due diligence. I know how painful false positive hires can be. But I've sat on the other side of hundreds of interviews at multiple FAANGs and without fail I would know what my recommendation was going to be within the first 5-10 minutes.This process is ludicrous. I cannot even begin to imagine how someone does this while being employed. Of course, being unemployed, I am juggling some absurd number of these at once, so I'm exhausted, struggling to schedule things (give us all your availability for the next week, and hope that by the time we actually pick some times two days later, those times are still free), and watching cash trend toward zero.I've finished several of these loops recently and am optimistic that this shitshow is coming to an end, but am seriously considering telling wherever I land that I can't start until May just so I can fucking recover.","Coming from six years at Google where I had two 30-minute interviews then an on-site where they flew me out for 3 30-minute interviews and introduction to the company and campus I'd work at - to applying for Amazon where there were two one-hour interviews and a final FIVE HOUR INTERVIEW SESSION which was all remote has sucked tremendously.I knew my experience with Google was being spoiled, but this final round of five hours is fucking insane.","The tech industry seems pretty intent on building our future dystopia","This looks like old school frat bro hazing to me.

Needless to say I was not hired, but I was relieved, I wouldn't have worked for a company with such a moronic process.","There are a few interview styles that I think we need to stop using.The \"See How You Think\" Question. This usually takes the form of questions like \"why are manhole covers round,\" or \"how many piano tuners are there in Los Angeles,\" or \"how would you build a house for a blind kangaroo?\" They are paired with the idea that it's less important to get \"the right answer\" and more important to demonstrate a thought process. Breaking the problem down. Calling out assumptions. Building on previous progress, etc. The problem is that no one really practices assessing answers to these problems. It's arrogant to believe you can just go into an interview and learn anything meaningful about how someone else thinks just by observing them trying to answer a question like this. There is so much opportunity for unconscious bias to take control of the outcome that this sort of question probably does more harm than good.The Esoteric Minutiae Question. E.g. \"how do you swap two ints without using a temporary variable\". Interviewers love to believe they are gauging how deep a candidate's knowledge goes, but they are fooling themselves. This sort of question is easily memorized. If the candidate doesn't know it, well, maybe you've learned that they don't remember how bitwise xor works. But if they get it right, does it reliably inform you that they do? Does it even matter either way?The Brain Teaser Question. These are questions that make people feel smart when they know the answer but really don't tell you anything about how well a candidate can perform a job. E.g. finding a counterfeit coin using a balance, or getting a fox, a chicken, and a bag of grain across a river. People may try to justify that these questions gauge how well a candidate thinks outside the box, but they really don't. You can think outside the box for days and never get the right answer. There is no algorithm for finding the right answer quickly. You can't really tell anything meaningful from the fact that one candidate got the answer quickly, another got it slowly, and a third didn't get it at all.Joel Spolsky had an essay called The Guerilla Guide to Interviewing. One of the key points was that you wanted to hire people who are 1) smart, and 2) get things done.The problem is that people created all sorts of insane interview processes around trying to determine these two things, and no one stopped to ask whether they were actually getting high quality answers to these questions.The scatterplot of interview outcomes to on-the-job success looks like a Jackson Pollock masterpiece.","The issue with the interviews is that they can‚Äôt seem to get everyone in the same room for 2-3 hours.

Japan is home to several leaders in photoresist, including JSR Corp. and Shin-Etsu Chemical Co.Tokyo and The Hague have responded coolly to Washington‚Äôs latest push, arguing that they want to assess the impact of their current curbs before considering tighter measures, some of the people said. US Commerce Department officials raised the issue in Tokyo during a meeting on export controls last month, according to one of the people.Representatives at ASML, the Dutch trade ministry and Japan‚Äôs Ministry for Economy, Trade and Industry declined to comment. The National Security Council declined to comment and the US Commerce Department didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment.The Biden administration has taken aim at China‚Äôs semiconductor industry since 2022, imposing sweeping controls on the export of advanced chip-making machines and sophisticated chips like those used to develop artificial intelligence. Japan and the Netherlands, the two key countries where chip-making equipment is developed, joined the US effort last year.But holes still remain, particularly in the ability of Japanese and Dutch engineers to continue doing some equipment repairs, and in the flow of spare parts that are used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.US officials got a shock last August when China‚Äôs Huawei Technologies Co. unveiled a smartphone powered by a homemade chip that is more than a generation ahead of where the US had sought to halt the Asian country‚Äôs progress.US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has vowed to take the ‚Äústrongest possible‚Äù action following the Huawei breakthrough, while Republican lawmakers have called for a complete block of Huawei and its chipmaking partner Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.‚Äôs access to US technology.The latest US push includes an effort to tighten existing limits. ASML needs a license to service and repair restricted gear in China, but the Netherlands has been somewhat lax about approval, according to one of the people. The US wants the Netherlands to take a more stringent approach, the person said.The US also wants to draw more countries into its export-control blockade. The Biden administration is trying to bring Germany and South Korea into an agreement that already includes Japan and the Netherlands, since all four countries are home to key firms in the semiconductor supply chain, according to the people.For Germany, one of the critical players is Carl Zeiss AG, a specialized glass maker that supplies ASML with the optical components necessary for advanced chip production. The US wants Germany to get Zeiss to pull back from shipping such components to China, the people said.Dutch officials also hope that Germany will join the export control group, according to the people, and the Biden administration is pushing for an agreement before the G7 summit in June. Berlin last year mulled over whether to restrict exports of chip chemicals to China, but Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is slated to visit China in April, has not yet taken a stance on the issue, according to the person. Scolz‚Äôs deputy Robert Habeck, meanwhile, is visiting the US this week and will meet Raimondo during his trip.In addition, the US has held talks with South Korea on chip export controls, given the country‚Äôs leading role in producing chips and supplying spare parts for chip-making equipment. The two countries launched a structured dialogue in February after US officials asked their counterparts in Seoul to join the multilateral group last year, according to some of the people."],"points":30},{"text":["Google now wants to limit the AI-powered search spam it helped create","I always read that website name as Arse-Technica.Anyway Google played itself.Wait until they find out generative A.I will soon completely ruin the Internet....and I hope it does.Maybe then il touch some grass and escape this hellscape.....nah I still got video games."],"points":5},{"text":["Linux market share passes 4% for first time; macOS dominance declines","macOS, meanwhile, has seen desktop market share drop from 21.32 percent in June to 15.42 percent in February.

Here's my patient perspective...I'm a lung transplant recipient (7 years this month). Ive been hospitalized probably a dozen times over the past 10 years, pre and post-transplant. Alert fatigue is a big thing for patients too. Many times I've had an alert go off and continue for several minutes until a nurse can attend to it.

But jeez it is annoying to lie in bed listening to beep-beep-beep for 5,7, 10 minutes or more.With that, I just want to add that I think the world of nurses.

Bloodwork showed he had a heart attack, but his vitals were normal. They hooked him up to the vital signs monitors. I could see his BP, heart rate, pulse, and O2 level. Every time he moved his arm the alert beep would start. After the third time a nurse came into silence it, I started doing it myself. A week later he was transferred to a nursing home for rehab. There was a constant alarm beeping in the main hallway. I discovered it was tied to the patient call buttons. If any patient pushed their button, the alarm would start, a light outside their room would flash, and a panel at the nurses station would blink for the room. There were over 100 rooms. The alarm never stopped. The aides had long stopped paying attention. The patient call buttons were useless. A long-time resident told me the only way to get help was to yell at anyone you saw in the hallway.","My son almost died because of this. He was in the intensive care unit and was on a ventilator.

When they did, the ventilator started making tons of noise, warning of changes in air pressure. One of the X-ray techs decided to mute the ventilator because it was annoying him I guess.About a minute or so later I am looking into the room and watching them, and I notice my son‚Äôs lips and around his face was turning blue. I started yelling and screaming saying he couldn‚Äôt breathe.Doctors rushed in and they had to re-intubate him because his other tube had become plugged with mucus.The techs weren‚Äôt watching his oxygen levels.

The beeping was the last problematic thing there.

So it was like someone was blow drying their hair at the foot of the bed while several people were all blowing different whistles at the head. Then my room was next to the nurse's station so the automatic doors would swing open and crash against the wall of my room sounding like someone was kicking my door in every 5 minutes.
