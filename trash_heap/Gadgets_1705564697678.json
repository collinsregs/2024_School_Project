Wonderful.","I don't think modern phones are getting replaced with this ever. There is demand for this sort of simplicity but I doubt a majority want this. It's way too simplified and walking around using a GPT walkie-talkie gets old very very quickly. Most people want a computer in their pocket but just as the article says on this, modern phone does literally exactly what this device is capable of. It's only selling point is it strips 90% of your functionality in return for a simplistic experience that's voice-centered, which even a modern smartwatch can do much better if you want that simplicity","Why is this rabbit AI constantly posted about an everyone says the same thing, that it's worse than a smartphone in every way.This is clearly an army of bots or something posting this app. I see it every day in my feed in a different sub.Anything about this should be banned.","I watched this be presented at CES. It's cool for what it is.But everything it does can be replaced by an app on your phone.,ü§∑I do not see it succeding","Oh cool, 5% of the functionality of a smart phone in a similar form factor to a PlayDate.

I get 4-6 with an AWU.","Do they have to buy back any products retailers have bought and (I assume) also can‚Äôt sell?","I mean, what are the chances of another respiratory virus going around","Better headline, apple steals and finds a way to circumvent the law, again","Will they actually remove the sensor that measures blood oxygen or just remove the feature from the software?","I ditched the Apple Watch a few years back. The battery life was one of the main drivers. Charging every day or so was kind of annoying. Now I love my Gamrin.","Hopefully other patents are challenged, and this thing gets banned outright.","I‚Äôd rather they shit percentage points and chew aluminum. But this is a temporary solution for suckers who won‚Äôt buy the device for biofeedback.","I don't get why Is it so hard for people to gave a BP, BS, and an oxymeter at home.I can understand if you have a condition, but otherwise?

Or will it just apply to all NEW Apple Watches getting released moving forward? And if it‚Äôs the former and you decide to not update the watch, will you be able to keep the feature ?","Another perspective: I worked for a leading maker of pulse oximeters. Everything we did was subject to FDA scrutiny; that was the easy part. Avoiding frivolous lawsuits from Masimo was more difficult. Masimo used litigation and threats of litigation to intimidate its competitors long before it made a claim against Apple.","What watch face is that? I kinda like it","Glad I got my 9 a couple weeks ago. The finger gesture they added is so handy.","I feel like there needs to be serious consequences for this. Not \"you owe this company 250 million dollars, don't do it again\" consequences, but more like \"you owe this company 250 million dollars, also pay 500 billion in fines, hopefully you learn your lesson.\"How many cases of corporate misconduct do we read about where the punishment is so small it's basically ignorable? Apple is a giant company, they tried to use that to bully a smaller company. The same way they tried to pick on someone a fraction of their size, they need to be picked on.Actions like this can absolutely sink a company. Apple needs to lose so much money it puts them at risk of going out of business, because that's what they were willing to do to someone else.","Wish I had a dollar for every time I read this","I mean sure they hired away Masimo engineers to make their own, but they also hired away Intel designers to make their M chip so it‚Äôs just par for the course?","Who the hell do these guys think they are, John Bloodoxtech (inventor of blood oxygen technology)?","","Can't we just ban crapple?","Someone tell me whose life is getting better because Apple had to make a worse watch?","It‚Äôs really ridiculous, you can get a meter starting at $10","What‚Äôs the point of the extra side sticking out where the dial is at??

Fix it, Apple.","But it‚Äôs innovative af? Why let people suffer","Publicity stunt? At this point it has to be... More exposure than any legitimate advertising they could've done.","Masimo is playing with fire here. There‚Äôs always a huge risk when engaging in high-stakes patent litigation with someone who has the kind of legal horsepower that Apple does - the nuclear option of a defense motion to find the patent invalid is always looming. Only after trying that approach will they even consider licensing or acquiring the patent.","Can someone explain why? I haven‚Äôt looked into it and at this point idk where to look","Title should read 'Apple disables feature on watch rather than pay patent holder'.It's not banned at all, it's just not their tech."],"points":758},{"text":["Exynos 2400: Samsung confirms deca-core CPU and FSR support for Xclipse 940","We want a LARGE battery, a large lens for high clarity, physical buttons with touch fingerprint sensor and a jackphone port and make this waterproof.It is so easy Samsung.

Great feature.Basically they delay you from changing settings e.g. disable FaceID if you're not at home/work.Which should help prevent a lot of phone thefts.","For anyone wondering why this is being addressed, this WSJ podcast does a great story on the vulnerability and how it was exploited.","This is good.","Correct title: The next iOS update will make it harder to break into your Apple ID account.","Yeah yeah.. same headline different update.","Apple shouldn't use a passcode to unlock everything of an iphone at first. Such low secured encryption key should only be used to unlock the screen.","Apple needs to make a feature that would require a passcode to turn off the phone. Most of the time thieves would steal a phone and turn it off to prevent tracking and send it off to China to be stripped.","Yet another thing to be aware of when you inherit a deceased person's phone.","I don‚Äôt want to break into my phone. If it‚Äôs preventing others then fuck yeah.","Great but why is it every day I'm getting a message from halfway around the world someone's trying to login into my apple ID?","Seems like a separate password for iCloud would have been a lot more flexible of an option, but where's the vendor lock-in for hardware repair in that?","Will my 6s be included?","Zero day for that shit incoming.","My problem with this is that FaceID isn't 100% accurate.

I know some of these words...","I'll preface this by saying QLC gets a bad rap, it's improved a ton and capable enough for a phone, but with how much they charge for flash (like $1 a gig) switching to QLC to save $0.01 on that gig is an insult.Where it's going to be rough is when your phone is near full and your phone is consuming tons of time and cycles defragging the storage with the slower QLC writes.","Nothing about the cost will be lower when it comes to iPhone storage.","Why? Apple asks a higher premium for higher storage variants and they are still greedy?","I would be extremely mad if they use cheaper part without lowering the price.","Using cheaper storage while increasing prices seems to be pointless.","Damn it will be hilarious if they still maintain their overpricing of storage even after switching from TLC to QLC ü§°","QLC is such thrash haha apple stupid.Meanwhile My intel 600P from 2015 in my 24/7 torrent pc is still up and running.Please tell me more about your 9 years old phones that you still use everyday","Where is this QLC not lasting long coming from? Article writer needs to go back to tech school.","Keep in mind that, as well as a reduction in endurance, QLC can be significantly slower as well.True Apple innovation.","Disposable, just like they want their products to be.","The average consumer doesn‚Äôt care about this. These small ‚Äòenhancements‚Äô are tiresome. No one at Apple has the balls or vision to overhaul the landscape of the iPhone, which is what it needs. What initially made iPhone so revolutionary was because Steve Jobs wasn‚Äôt afraid to make big scale changes. He wasn‚Äôt afraid to wipe the slate clean and start over, no matter how much work was involved up to that point. He was innovative.No one at Apple is a big enough visionary, brave enough, or has the clout to make sweeping changes to Steve Jobs‚Äô last vision. There is a huge fear to take it to the next level because nobody wants to be responsible for tanking the iPhone brand.","iphone fuckin sucks. even at basic shit now like battery life.","Article by Microsoft comments by Apple","Love the outrage by folks who are falling for a rumor from a phone that's 8 months away from even being announced. Highly doubtful rumor and yet, it'll do what it intended to do, drive website clicks and ad revenue.","I realize that QLC is inferior to TLC but this is a use case where I can't see it becoming an issue. People don't fill and empty their phones very frequently and the slow long term writing speed shouldn't affect any operation of a phone really. The really disgusting bit is that this is only a move to improve their margins though, so fuck Apple for that.","Why do people need so much storage when there‚Äôs iCloud?Edit: wow!

Will YOU complete the trial?","A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light and other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape it.[2] The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.[3][4] The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[6][7] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.","All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....","Wait, you actually opened the comments?
