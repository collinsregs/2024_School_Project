If a song is good itâ€™s good.There are artists I love who will never make another instant classic again. If some machine could hand me 5 new Beatles albums or Pink Floyd albums, and they were good? Why would that not appeal?Additionally I believe that a well promoted ai song has a greater capacity to be moving and high quality than a human made song if the human is only interested in crafting a hit by following popular trends, for the purpose of making money, as many do.","I appreciate the unique perspective AI offers, even if it doesn't resonate with me personally. It's a fascinating new frontier in music creation.","So if I had a painter paint the vision I had in my head while having them make adjustments as I go: who is the artist? It was my vision, but they did the work. In my personal opinion these are two separate things: talent and vision. You respect the talent that goes into making things, we respect the vision. To us, it doesn't matter how we got to end result, what matters is that the artist is able to adequately express themselves. AI is a new avenue of expression. But you are absolutely welcome to dislike it the same way our parents hated on Rock N Roll, Rap and Electronic music lmao.Edit - And another question to help reframe this more: how great is the greatest painter if he has no creativity? It doesn't matter if you have all the techniques down if you lack creativity.","Your argument is black versus white. In the future the most likely outcome is a hybrid of AI and human elements going into making music and all media, just as technology has been integrated into music for the last few decades.","I love music, regardless of how it was created. It can be from rain against my window, a heart broken person, a functioning addict, or an AI created symphony","From listing to some of the suno.ai tracks, there is a distinct feeling of hollowness in the music. It might be related to what youâ€™re describing.I think it will be more successful generating muzak/elevator music, and other non-offensive music meant to be in the background. At least for now","It sounds bangin?","The fun thing about art is that it's value is subjective.","There was already an abundance of soulless music out there before AI and some people love it. The track itself should speak for itself. If you like it, you like it. Doesnâ€™t matter where it came from. Though I also do not care about who wrote or performed the music I listen to begin with. I understand some people care a lot and know all the band members names and get a little obsessed with them, but thatâ€™s not how I roll. In other words, I donâ€™t give a shit, Dee.","You are talking about the fact that you dont like AI made songs...They are getting so good that I just don't think you'll be able to notice in a year or two","I just don't care about people I guess.","There's nothing appealing about it. Music is art. Good art comes from the wild, mad & warped minds of human beings who make it.AI will be able to make music that sounds technically perfect. If you find yourself enjoying AI-generated music in the future, like if it becomes your thing, know that you're a tasteless bore and you should keep your opinions about music to yourself.","I have ideas for very specific songs in very specific genres, yet little in the way of music theory to create what I want to hear.","If the music is good, the music is good. No matter who or what created it.Same as all other art. 99%, I don't even know who created the shows and random music I consume, and it doesn't matter to me, could as well be AI-generated for all I care. If I enjoy it I enjoy it.","Nothing that Iâ€™ve heard. I went to a Google IO, they had all kinds of presentations demonstrating it, they worked it into concerts for two major acts that they put on. It was just terrible. It didnâ€™t have what I guess I would describe as a strong identity. It was just mush.","I don't enjoy music, or art, or anything else because of who or what created it; I enjoy it because of what that song or image evokes in me when I experience it. (And in the case of AI-generated art, there's still a human in the loop, guiding the process so that the final result \"says\" something, reflecting whatever they envisioned and their personal aesthetic sense.)","for me, it's created by analyzing the sum total of human created music which already has all that mystical garbage you presume you'd be able to listen for.have you heard? most human created music truly sucks. the songs you've heard? that is like less than 1% if the music that humans have created. it sucks so badly that nobody would ever train ai on all of it because then it would suck much worse too.if it's good music, it's good music.","Humans run on algorithms more than we realize. Ourr emotions are simulated by the brain just as every single sensory input isâ€”we have no direct experience of reality, itâ€™s all simulated in our brain. Truth is, we are more like AI than we realize. Our brain just has the incredible ability to process data on very low powerâ€”about the amount it takes to light a dim light bulb. Thatâ€™s the main advantage we (currently) have over AI. In the end AI will create amazing music because in fact, most human music follows theory, which is a set of rules and ultimate an algorithm. Emotions are a simulated illusion. Intelligence is the real product and humans donâ€™t have the sole authority on intelligence. We just like to think we are extra special.","I understand your perspective on this matter, especially in this era of AI art. The current generation of music AI models hasn't yet produced anything that resonates with me personally. However, I believe that as these models evolve and improve, everyone â€” including you and me â€” will eventually experience a moment of connection with a piece of music. It could be a moment when you can't resist dancing, feel chills, or even become emotional and tear up. This can happen in various contexts and circumstances, making it difficult to discern whether the music is AI-generated or not. And honestly, it doesn't matter. I think that moment will shift many people's perspectives once they experience it. I'd also argue that a significant part of our connection to music is not the intention of the artist who created it but how our brains have adapted to processing sound through lifelong exposure to music and associating certain sounds and songs with important memories. As someone who has been producing music for 8 years, I believe the experience of music is about listening to the piece, not so much the process behind its creation. That's how you determine if it sounds pleasant. Besides, if you find out a piece was AI-created after you've already enjoyed it, would you change your opinion? My point is: if you can't tell the difference, does it really matter? Most music consumption is now digital, and there's no way to tell if it's AI-generated if the quality matches that of human creation. Making the effort to manually check all of this seems excessive and unrealistic."],"points":43},{"text":["Are there any ai meeting note takers that work with Whatsapp calls on my mobile?"],"points":0},{"text":["Social Media Analytics with AI?"],"points":0},{"text":["Looking for an audio cloning tool that can do this..."],"points":0},{"text":["China shifting its investment strategy from large-scale infrastructure projects to high technology, including AI","It's actually a smart move in my opinion. We know that digital is the future and we are in the midst of a much larger phase of industrial shift. The battleground is based on commerce and technology. With the right investment in resourcing and innovation, you could lock in dominance for the next few centuries. They already have laid the frame work for a raw materials pipeline with Africa. The best thing is because of the nature of capitalism, Western countries allow foreign training in not only the workplace but also higher education with many returning back perspective countries in fields that should have some conditional constraints. There is also the imbalance of acquisitions in real estate both residential and commercial (farmland) in particular). Long term, we are feeding the wolf. This is just my opinion.","China introduced what it calls \"new infrastructure\" as part of its latest five-year economic development plan. An umbrella term for emerging tech, new infrastructure encompasses AI, blockchain, cloud computing, big data, new energy, automated factories, 5G, ultra-high-voltage transmission and industrial internet.","Dictator orders stuff and things it's gonna happen.
