The amount of funding it takes to develop an airliner ain't even funny, even if they do it you can count of years upon years of testing where they're making zero money before FAA/EASA would let one fly. Even if they develop batteries good enough for this, you'd also need airports equipped to service your plane, extensive pilots and mechanics training, it'd be a massive gamble for an airline.I have a feeling this is less a serious attempt at making one, and more an attempt at just making some kind of tech that's good enough to sell their company to an established manufacturer where it'd probably go to die unfortunately.","Submission Statement:A Dutch startup is challenging the belief that battery-powered aircraft must be small and short-range, proposing to develop a 90-seat, 500-mi.-range all-electric airliner.

While Automation and AI are going to play huge parts in our future, Demographics will likely be the big shift over the next 5-10 years.For the United States.Baby Boomers are retiring, half have already retired and the vast majority of the other half are going to retire by 2030. They were the largest generational workforce in American history, they were the largest (or 2nd largest, behind their children, the Millennials) but they were also a generation where women working was very common.Gen Z, the up and coming Generation is much smaller. The difference between the Baby Boomers retiring and Gen Z entering the workforce age is a deficit of about 400,000 people per year and will actually ramp up. Accoridng to Zeihan it will be nearly a million per year by 2030.Ever since the Boomers have entered their working ages in the late 60s (when the oldest boomers were in their early 20s) there has been a huge abundance of labor. Companies were built around the mentality that labor is easily replaceable. For as long as Boomers have been working (certain the younger half, who are now hitting their 70s), you could easily replace employees.This new shift is changing that whole labor ecosystem. That whole \"no one wants to work!\" mentality is going to get much worse and its really that our existing corporate and business leadership doesn't have any experience in an ecosystem where there is a labor shortage. This labor shortage is going to get worse and worse. Eventually businesses are going to have to be in a position where if they want to keep talent, they are going to have to pay them well.There are something like 100 mega factories either being planned or are already under construction in the United States. There are also many going in with our partner country, Mexico. In order for America to keep our level of consumption, particularly with technology, we have to replace SE Asian manufacturing with Mexican manufacturing. We will still be trading with Japan and Vietnam, but China and South Korea are facing demographic collapse. These 100+ factories are going to each employ thousands of people.There is not going to be America vs Mexico. We are all NAFTA now. Its AmericaMexicoCanada with a few other partners vs the world. We are now on the same side. Organized labor is likely going to have the greatest amount of leverage in the 2030s since like the 1950s. That whole \"Grandpa had a good factory job in 1955 and afforded a family and a comfortable lifestyle\" story, well his great grand kids are going to have that in 2035. Much of this is going to be involved with solar, wind, batteries and all of the products that go with them and the US South is going to be a HUGE player. Look at what is going on in Georgia right now with their major factory investments. The Texas Triangle is going to be a huge power player in the future.We are probably going to have to spend hundreds of billions or even a trillion dollars on massive infrastructure upgrades which will bring Mexico into the American system. Heavy rail lines to link up Mexican industry to American industry, highway construction, and maybe even some high speed passenger rail to link up places like Monterrey to the Texas Triangle.Europe is going to be a total fucking mess. The largest manufacturer, Germany, is heading towards mass retirement with a tiny replacement generation and is overly dependent on Russian energy and raw materials. The UK has left the EU and needs to do whatever they can to make a trade partnership with the US.There are going to be many industries disrupted. Much of them will have to do with fossil fuel consumption. A lot of mechanics will be disrupted (granted, they will be fairly easy to retrain for working on other equipment, we are going to have a shortage of people who can fix and maintain things). Automation is going to replace jobs, AI is going to replace jobs, but we need so much more production in the US that its not going to matter. We need to more than double the US industrial output.","I think those who combine multiple disciplines and leverage Ai to expedite their work flow will remain employed the longest.

What happened to AI delivery drones?There is so much resistance and incompetence that general AI would have to be perfect for it to impact us in the next 10 years at the doomsday levels people keep spouting.AI is going to happen but it's mostly going to be a labor reduction not replacement. And it's 10 years before the worry should start.As much as I fear being unemployed I have a fear that the universe has a cruel irony in that AI will cause a jovens paradox towards human labor fueling a inflationary spiral of endless hustle to create content, data, or analysis to just keep up with what everyone else is creating.","The more robots amazon warehouses add, the more people they need to deal with the output of the robots.

This is why the GOP took the turn it did after 2008 because white christians fell into the minority sometime during Obama's term. The backlash to that was Trump being elected, which further drove the GOP into a more hardline white christian nationalist movement and the Democratic Party into the described multicultural state. And this is what the current fight in US politics is about because white non-christians have largely aligned with those minority populations, while white christians, now in the numerical minority (as opposed to the cultural or institutional minority) struggle to win national elections and are turning to other non-democratic mechanisms to hold power.","My prediction: By 2050 most Latinos will be described as white in the way Italians or Iranians are considered white today. Politically, the way they vote will be nearly indistinguishable from the way other Americans vote. Chinese and Indians will be \"Sorta White\" in the way Jewish Americans are already (Jews being a group that in Europe were traditionally considered \"white\").Evidence: It's already the case that Latino's are trending away from voting democrat. Many of the most famous Latino politicians today are republicans (think Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, probably the two highest profile Latino politicians in the USA). Also, Latinos tend to be socially conservative (most are devout Catholics or Born Again Christians). Plenty of Latinos don't see current GOP anti-immigration rhetoric as a reason not to vote GOP. Finally, most Latino countries have the same racial dynamics as the USA, only with a larger indigenous/Mestizo population. Most Latinos in the USA today are white, and it's not surprising that they'll align with being white in the American racial system, seeing as they had such a status in their native country's \"system\".Finally, as to Chinese/Indians becoming white adjacent, there's a very large well-integrated Indian/Chinese community in the USA today who are 2nd or even 3rd or 4th generation. Many are business owners or elite professionals, and their politics end up being roughly similar to Jewish Americans who also match that profile IE favouring liberal tolerance/being against christian dominionism as in the GOP, but being otherwise being pro-establishment/pro-capitalist/anti-socialist/centre right. If the GOP shifted away from the Christian Right, you could imagine the Republicans capturing these voters fairly easily. You can already see this with a figure like Vivek Ramaswamy, Elaine Chao, or Nikki Haley(born Nimarata Nikki Randhawa).

This is in no small part because \"what actually, physically is Alzhiemers\" is an open question)","I found this take on it interesting:The drug companies don‚Äôt suppress promising medications. Promising medications start off pre-suppressed.In some cases they are suppressed by regulation that says a drug has to go through crazy expensive trials before it can be approved. In other cases, they are suppressed simply by the burden of proof: even without the government, doctors aren‚Äôt going to prescribe something they don‚Äôt know is safe and effective, and they‚Äôre not going to know it‚Äôs safe and effective without studies, which as I may have mentioned are crazy expensive. In still other cases, the medications are suppressed by medical conservativism: most doctors very reasonably don‚Äôt want to use a drug unless they know other doctors they respect are using the drug, so unless the drug impresses itself onto the consciousness of the entire medical community at once it will fizzle out.What drug companies do, as best I understand it, is put billions of dollars and millions of man-hours of effort into un-suppressing those particular drugs it is in their financial interest to un-suppress.

In 2002 after a botched marketing campaign the vaccine was pulled from production because the manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline (since bought by Unilever and renamed GSK) didn't feel like they were making enough money off of it. No Lyme disease vaccination has been approved since.","The people who make these types of claims are often the people who don't understand that cancer is actually many different diseases and that we do have treatments that are effectively cures for some types of cancer.","Pharm student here: usually the only reason why a company isn't interested in something is that they'll lose money from it. This is 99% of the times because not enough people will buy it at the price needed to go positive and since a very rough estimation can be made in advance they just aren't researched, basically any orphan disease (stuff that is too rare or only common in extremely poor countries). Any cure for something serious enough that already has a treatment would make them a fortune + investors would rain and throw money at them, the whole \"duh they only want to sell treatments so they hide a cure\" makes absolutely no sense from an economical point of view (which is the only point of view that administration boards of literally any company take into account).Other times treatments are developed and produced, but keeping up the production and distribution isn't as profitable as ditching it entirely, so they usually sell the patent (or simply stop paying for it and not care about that anymore, because trust me it's unbelievably expensive to keep a patent going). So, for the same reason, they just move on and use the plants for something else.It also doesn't make much sense saying \"the pharmaceutical companIES\", since one cannot just say \"nope, you're not doing research on that\" to the others and any time a better med is discovered that's another advantage over them and happy investors and all the usual things that apply to any company. Weaker competition means higher market share.TL;DR I have no specific examples, just the general rule that no company can magically masks the competition not sell a product, they benefit from selling an improved treatment (and even more from selling a cure to something that is only treated) and many times products are abandoned and topics not researched on because in general focusing on that would make them lose money.","A bacteria treatment similar to probiotics that would replace cavity causing flora with ones that did not damage enamel and thus stopped all cavities.

So either you're biting your own tail or you are dumping the costs of research exclusively on the end users, which is socially undesirable and also probably not economically correct.So at the end of the day it is worth asking if we really are saving money and actually benefiting people more with this scheme, especially knowing that research is a bad free market due to positive externalities, that our current method to account for those, being patents, is full of abuse, and that simply subsidizing corporations to account for externalities is also notoriously full of abuse.","Some years ago, 10+ years ago and I cant find the source anymore but....I've heard of one cancer treatment that was pretty much natural that was abandoned by a pharma company because it was found to not be profitable.After doing some digging on it because I saw all of this hysteria and uproar about this at the time, I learned that not all cancers are the same and the cancer that this cure worked on was extremely rare and it would actually lose the company money if they tried to mass manufacture a cure for something that so rarely effected people.I can understand that decision in the world we live in where CEOs are held accountable to shareholders and all that.

There is a mountain of evidence that it is bullshit but people like clinging to their conspiracy theories because it gives them comfort. When someone gets diagnosed with an untreatable disease they can blame it on some company. It wasn't just bad luck or poor live chose decisions that gave them or their loved ones a disease, it's some companys' fault they aren't healthy.‚ÄãIf you want some evidence that suggests the opposite of these conspiracy theories then look at:The national vaccination programs in various countries. We have basically eradicated several major diseases. What used to be a major threat like diphteria is basically gone, and as a result people don't think about it. The things we do cure end up being forgotten, so it gives the illusion of no progress because we only see the ones we haven't cured yet.There are plenty of super-rich and powerful people who have died in various diseases we don't have a cure for, including people working at medical companies. Imagine thinking that someone would rather die or have their child die, than to cure a disease because... money?It is a very US-centric view of the world. In a lot of countries, it is in the best interest (even financially) to keep people healthy. Our doctors in Sweden don't benefit from people being sick. Their paycheck is not determined by how many people they cure. In fact, their employer loses money whenever someone gets sick.‚ÄãAs soon as something goes even slightly wrong in the healthcare sector, people are extremely quick to blame doctors and such for doing things wrong. Yet when safety precautions are put in place people say they are just letting people die or they don't get treated seriously.It's very easy to come up with reasons for why your belief is correct, and people who believe in conspiracy theories generally only look for evidence that supports their beliefs and never question or look for evidence that contradicts them.‚Äã‚ÄãEdit:By the way, the NIH website currently lists 19,727 different clinical trials that are gearing up to accept test subjects. There are another 65,793 different trials looking for participants to test various medical treatments. It is absolutely insane to think that we are spending all this time and effort to finding cures, vaccines and treatment, and that somehow a multi-national conspiracy is taking place to not release a potential cure if it's found.Is it really so hard to believe that medicine is an incredibly complex thing and even though we spend trillions upob trillions of dollars on it, it still takes a lot of time, effort and sometimes luck to find solutions? And that we need to be extremely careful as well because failures could have horrible consequences that sets us back many many years.

There won't be a \"smoking gun\" for this, because it doesn't really work that way.

The 'bro science' for what food to eat has changed my life. Official guidelines are fucking garbage, and if you ask a doctor for help they dont know shit","Another interesting read:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Pharma_conspiracy_theories","Professional Neuroscientist, my work focuses on neurodegenerative diseases. What I have learned as a researcher is: drug approvals are a predilection to the masses. There in lies the rub.If you are tasked with making a drug, plan on getting it approved, then your goal is to identify a home-run target or something that targets a very specific variant. Everything is a numbers game and time and disease complexity are variables that do not benefit drug manufacturers.To this point, drug approval requires testing, one needs to readily be able to get a sufficient number of individuals/ a good model to even justify making a treatment.If all dollars are equal, as a company making a drug, I either need to guarantee success or cast a real wide net to get a good risk-to-reward. Ultimately, the goal is to optimize the likelihood for success and therefore, I need to make sure my work is profitable. Now consider that government backed research has been basically stagnant for 30+ years and half of the US doesn‚Äôt trust that scientists are doing things for the greater good (See the Covid vaccine; the fastest, best vaccine to fix an immediate threat, and met with half the population saying they know better than the scientists that have dedicated their lives to help people with their research). So private companies dictate what gets fixed because they need to stay in business.Unfortunately, certain diseases/disorders, such as neurodegenerative disorders, require a really long timeline to generate proof of concept for a medication. Individuals diagnosed with the disease have also largely already started to succumb to neurodegeneration and thus, drugs are stuck being developed to treat a disease at a time of diagnosis after substantial disease onset. These medications may or may not treat the underlying disease and instead the observed symptoms. However, it may also already be too late. Individuals who display Parkinson‚Äôs disease symptoms have already lost a substantial portions of their brain that regulate movement and the underlying disease as an example. Thus it‚Äôs hard to design a drug to treat a disease when it cannot be diagnosed early enough to actually treat the underlying symptoms.So, what this means is, assuming altruism, a company might scrap a potential treatment that could work in a portion of individuals because: 1) They cannot get the treatment to work in a majority of those tested, even if it works for a specific set of the population 2) They cannot create a reliable model to test a drug, even if they have evidence of it working in humans 3) the company cannot turn a profit. This means studies too long timelines are highly unlikely to happen because of the cost to run them. IE why test drug X over 10 years if I could get drug Y approved after a 1.5 year long study. 4) the drug doesn‚Äôt sufficiently treat a disease relative to when the disease is diagnosed.The silver lining is that personalized medicine might fix this problem moving forward. Why give you an approved drug for the masses, if I can sample your fibroblasts, turn them into neurons, and screen a library of drugs to identify a specific treatment. It‚Äôs not that far off, we can already reprogram cells, but the cost is prohibitive.For better or worse the drug approval process over scrutinizes drug candidates. The outcome is high quality treatments for approved drugs but also a subset of drugs that might otherwise be beneficial to a subsection of individuals left on the chopping block.","There are examples of vaccines that aren‚Äôt produced because the markets aren‚Äôt profitable.

It sidesteps the need for expensive infrastructure.The continent's energy requirements are expected to increase considerably in the coming decades.An additional investment of $30 billion a year is required. China, US, and Europe are most likely to help finance it.","While all such power generation attempts have been unsuccessful so far, underwater current turbines would be great for Mozambique as the greatest constant flow on the planet is just off their coast.","Why are the green choices with my utility so much more expensive if green is getting so cheap?"],"points":21}]
