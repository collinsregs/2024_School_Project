Will YOU complete the trial?","A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light and other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape it.[2] The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.[3][4] The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[6][7] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.","All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....All this squares make a circle....","Wait, you actually opened the comments?

That data can be cleansed and shaped so that an LLM can appear to be an expert as good as the top human experts. But as \"the top\" experts are sought out, and put into the training data, the training data gets smaller, and smaller. So the range of questions and capabilities shrink.This is a \"neural language model with a rule-bound deduction engine, which work in tandem to find solutions\" so it's an LLM, with cleaned up data, and a fact check stapled on.This is the direction AI research needs to go. Stapling other things to it. Particularly stapling LLMs to other LLMs is probably going to be an important avenue. Imagine multiple LLMs that are trained on arguing using processes of reason and logic to get to what they believe is the right course of action, then checking whether that action is possible?...oh wait, I think they're just playing DnD.","Scary but exciting..","\"AlphaGeometryâ€™s system combines the predictive power of a neural language model with a rule-bound deduction engine, which work in tandem to find solutions.
