This is definitely still a pilot. 10 trains ordered with a possibility of 29 in total.Of all the things to electrify, trains are pretty straight forward. Hydrogen should be an ancillary option at most, and is not \"the train of the future\".","Just electrify the lines for christ's sake. Put in the infrastructure like most 1st world, even 3rd world countries have. It's a worthwhile investment.","In the rest of the world trains have been electrified for the past 100 years. They do it over longer distances than anything we have in North America and through terrain that's more challenging as well.It's mind boggling why we can't just put in standard, off the shelf stuff that's proven to work and will do the job cheaper and better.","Hydrogen on trains is the best usage of the fuel that we could have- if our rail lines were as safe as they're supposed to be. Most of our train details have been because of our trains being out of date, not properly manned, or not designed to modern standards.We need to press on railroad barons to make their trains safer, lest we wind up with traveling bombs.","There really isn't a better option at this point. America's rails should be electrified, but we lost all that knowledge and the factories that built it were dismantled forty years ago. California is rebuilding this capacity with the state HSR program, but that is still ten years away at least. Meanwhile, the freight railroads are adopting H2 cells and it appears it will supplement diesel in the same way diesel once supplemented steam, before completely eliminating diesel. California's CARB is subsidizing this transition, both in the private industry and public transit work, the latter of which the article talks about.Anyway, what it means for the rest of the US: by 2035, H2 cells will be standardized commodities and mass produced. All major railroads will be using them to some extent. Many trucks and construction vehicles will also be H2 powered. We might even have H2 powered boats, if CARB's other industrial development programs bear fruit. Which means: 15 years from now, diesel techs will be under the same pressure steam engineers were in the 1950s. Most of those engineers simply retired or took on larger jobs at stationary power plants, which is what diesel manufacturing will be increasingly oriented towards.","US Government*","It sucks having to wait at a station while they switch between diesel and electric locomotives.

I saw a lot of EVs in used car dealerships that couldn‚Äôt sell because suddenly new Teslas were cheaper than used ones. The dealerships or original owners are now in a tough spot, where the dealership might have to sell it at a loss, or the original owner might have to sell it for less than they owe on their loan.This was also exacerbated by the prices being too high in 2021-2022. Owners overpaid for the cars and so when Tesla had large prices cuts in 2023 that meant the owners couldn‚Äôt sell their cars to break even on their loans. This situation affected ICE owners as well but ICE manufacturers weren‚Äôt cutting prices as far. Also because Tesla has 55% market share for EVs in the U.S., when they cut prices that far it hits the entire EV sector in the U.S.These price drops are good for buyers, good for consumers, good for EV adoption rates, and only bad for people trying to sell their overpriced cars after just a couple of years.","Early adopters pay more initially in pretty much any product as technology advances quickly.

That means someone could get a new car for about $40K that car that was better than a Model S. So any used model S had to be sold for less than $40K. Even though it cost $80K-$90K new. Yeah, that's gonna hurt.It's really not hard to see why this happens. And it mostly isn't inherent to EVs. It just market conditions due to how EVs are being sold right now and rapid advances in the vehicles.","How much of this is because prices have been going down for new cars due to increased competition and supply?","It would be wonderful if the people flipping Teslas during 2020-2021 completely fucked themselves.","Because they were artifically inflated during COVID. I remember brand new Mini Electrics costing ¬£21,000 before COVID that suddenly became ¬£29,000 during. Super cheap electric econoboxes at the ¬£18-19,000 mark were dropped completely, and a glut of promised ¬£30,000 priced cars all entered the market at ¬£40,000+. I consider the rapid drop to be an estimation of the true value the cars had when they were sold, which was all roughly 10k lower than what RRP was.","I think most tech enthusiasts knew that's what's gona happen,the EVs don't break down like the gas motor ones but when it's time to change that battery,you're f'cked","If anything that‚Äôs good, EVs need to develop a second hand market. Only real problem is that depreciation makes owners less likely to list, can only hope that balances out","Used car prices have been heading in the right direction after months of elevated values and inventory shortages. Even so, the values of some vehicles have declined much faster than others, with EVs doing the heavy lifting. Automotive data outfit iSeeCars' latest study looked at used car values over the past year, finding that used electric vehicles are dropping at a much faster rate than their gas-powered counterparts.While used car values have been dropping overall over the past year, used EVs have dropped like a stone in comparison. iSeeCars found that the average for used electric models fell by up to almost 32 percent since 2023, while the used gas vehicle average price sank by just 3.6 percent. Used EV pricing trends over the past year look like this:February 2024: -31.8%January 2024: -30.8%December 2023: -31.2%November 2023: -33.7%October 2023: -33.7%September 2023: -39.1%August 2023: -38.7%July 2023: -34.7%June 2023: -29.5%May 2023: -29.9%","As someone that just bought a used electric car.Bought a 2019 full electric ionic for the same price as the 2019 fuel one.People dont want them because the tech advances too quick. A brand new 2024 electric ionic has 400km range. The 2019 has barely 200.","With rebates getting higher and the general price of EVs dropping, how would you not expect this? I've seen some used EVs attempting to sell at almost the same cost as a new after rebates and breaks.","Sure, but I assume that's because unlike gasoline cars, the difference between a 2022 EV and a 2025 EV is huge. And a 2028 EV will be an order of magnitude better than the 2025. The technology is still in its rapid growth phase, unlike your 2014 Honda that is essentially the same as a 2024.","Are they comparing $100k teslas to $100k gas cars? Or is it an average of all electric vs all gas? My guess is that it‚Äôs really easy to make the numbers look whatever way they want for their article.","Nobody wants to buy a used battery","Around Christmas, I got an email from Toyota promoting their hydrogen-powered Murai, a car listed at about $55,000, 0% APR load for 72 months, and with $37,000 in 'incentives' that brought the cost down to $18,000. I thought, \"Wow, a Toyota for nearly a third of the list price. Such a deal.\" The deal was legit, and the car was very nice. However, it is hydrogen-powered, and part of the deal was $15,000 in hydrogen credits for fuel. I live in a metropolitan area of almost 10 million people, which has about a dozen hydrogen stations, and the closest was twenty miles away. That might have been manageable. Then, I happened to be talking with a friend who operates a body shop. He told me they had a year-old Murai in with a banged-up quarter panel. The damage was cosmetic, but the insurance estimate totaled the car. Repairs required the removal of the hydrogen tank and related parts, which pushed the bill into the stratosphere.This was in the ad -APR offer is available through Toyota Financial Services to well-qualified buyers with approved credit.

You used to get no rebate for a used EV, and now you get a reduced rebate - so not only do you instantly lose value when you drive an EV off the lot like you would for any car, but the rebate value has to be ticked off as well.","This isn't comparing used to new prices. It is comparing last year's typical price for a used EV with this year's typical price for a used EV. Weren't EVs ridiculously good at holding value previously?","I have a dream where North America will improve its public transportation, where its safe and viable for the majority of the population, instead of listening to tech bros about autonomous self driving to address our problems.","Uh maybe because EV tech is advancing at rapid pace, so your 2019 bolt depreciated a lot more when comparing it to an Ioniq 5 that charges 3x faster. This isn‚Äôt that hard to figure out. This is what happens when new tech emerges","The biggest driver here isn‚Äôt physical depreciation, it is macroeconomic trendsThere used to be massive federal and state tax rebates and incentive programs for EVs, most of them also used to be perceived as luxury due to their newness and tech-adjacent hype, and producers - mainly Tesla - rocketed productionThe rebates and incentives waned significantly, the luxury reputation mostly died as they became more accessible and the average consumer realized they were still just cars and changed their price sensitivity accordingly, and overproduction led to high supply with decreasing demand to further suppress pricesIt isn‚Äôt that EVs deteriorate faster - they generally deteriorate slower, excluding when compared in very low temperature environments - they were just very overpriced relative to price determining factors and have corrected downTL;DR: EVs don‚Äôt depreciate faster, they had a massive price correction due to a number of macroeconomic factors","You can get a model S these days for $30k! Great buying opportunity if you are in the market for a car now. They used to be like 50-60k used","If you buy any car, don‚Äôt expect to resell it for anywhere near what you bought it for.","Another way to read this is that EVs are overpriced.","That‚Äôs great news when prices fall! I see a lot more teslas on the road.","Part of the reason is tax credits.","We bought a model Y in mid-2020 for 59,500.

This was all predictable.","As for so many of the comments here... imagine going to every ICE car thread and asking/proclaiming the engine is going to die as soon as the warranty period is over. What?","BUT if you get a used electric, chances are the battery is still under warranty and the simpler mechanical systems means there‚Äôs likely less expensive repairs or maintenance.

Union Pacific actually demostrated similar technology ~15 years ago as part of an experiment to move containers between their LA yards and the LA port. While this has limited application for terrestrial earth railways, this can probably work as a conveyance system like for elevators or warehouse palletjacks. For example, imagine a million 24x24\" of these on a narrow-gauge railway within an Amazon warehouse complex moving parcels around between trains or intermodal containers. Such a system works better with a typical 48x48\" pallet though, and I can imagine it being a central part of very large warehouses and factories.","Cool, but what would that system do at railroad crossings? It looks like it has wheels inside and out of the rails but at crossings there isn‚Äôt room for those guide wheels.","Calling 100% gadgetbahn on this one.The team hasn't revealed any further details on the latest prototype, but stresses that zero modifications were made to the tracks and that no elements were added to the infrastructure.Great, but there's no world in which an implementation of this technology doesn't require significant infrastructure installation - namely power delivery. Overhead wires aren't going to give you that because you're not touching the rails for your earth, so are you going with a double catenary system like an old trolleybus used to have? Or are you going to fit a whole bunch of power coils in the track. Because nobody is building a diesel-powered maglev.Simply being able to levitate a vehicle above the tracks is only one small step. And if the rails are already there (which is the advantage this tech claims to have), then simply running regular fast trains is going to be far, far cheaper to implement and very close in rolling efficiency, rather than getting this thing working. Steel wheels on steel rail have extremely low resistance, and are exceptionally reliable.Just build a train, people. They work.","How does a magnet create repulsion against a non magnetic steel rail?","Ah, just what America needs for its crumbling rail infrastructure‚Ä¶ faster trains.","This might work with Hyperloop, too.","I wonder how this would deal with potential gaps/breaks on the rails, where a regular train would just plow right over it and be fine."],"points":108}]
