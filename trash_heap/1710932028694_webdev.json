Just look at the most successful software project in history the Linux kernel. The kernel is full of reused code because each aspect of the kernel is its own ‘module’ where no code comes in nor leaves. The benefit here is that changes in any module cannot affect the functionality of any other module. This reduces entanglement as any entanglement is necessarily confined to its module rather than the whole project. This is the ultimate problem with DRY, entanglement now has no confines and affects the whole project. When you WET (write everything twice) complexity grows more slowly and in my opinion creates faster to run and iterate on codebases.","I agree with most points, but many developers are way to religious with them.Doing DRY as a default is essentially a premature optimization mistake. Yes, if you repeat something multiple times and it gets in the way of readability, by all means, make it abstract. But DRY code can be messy in of itself just due it all being generic and abstract.As u/Inside-Ad-5943 also mentioned:The benefit here is that changes in any module cannot affect the functionality of any other module. This reduces entanglement as any entanglement is necessarily confined to its module rather than the whole project.Plenty of times you'll be repeating some code in contexts that may change over time. And you might end up complicating things trying to achieve a generic system that works for all options, whereas just having similar code in several functions can remain there untouched.I have the same issue with enforcing method lengths. While it is generally a good idea to keep functions compact and focused. Sometimes you go over it out of necessity, and splitting it up in multiple functions becomes messier than keeping it big.So, my point here is: While these code smell guidelines are generally good. You shouldn't just blindly implement because the linter said so.

Instead of worrying that it’s a foriegn system, accept that it’s a well architected codebase that you can learn from.You probably won’t need to know much about mysql other than writing sql. That’s not to difficult to learn. The framework should abstract it for you so you would need to learn its api to build the back end. Only in weird cases where the framework is can’t do that you need or hits a performance bottleneck do you need to do stuff that’s mysql specific. I’ve had to install and configure mysql, otherwise have spent very little time in my career dealing directly with the database, other than custom sql queries or checking the logs for slow queries. SQL is very valuable though. I was able to bounce between pulling stuff from mysql and sql server no problem. In the long run, keep an eye on how these web systems are evolving. I’m a Drupal dev, so similar to Django in a php environment. Both camps have to confront the rising tide of JavaScript frameworks.

I rarely front load learning, but I try to really understand things as I work through them. I do experiments often for fun and curiosity and that leads me to reading docs in my free time. I made a browser extension over the weekend and came back on Monday and gave an overview of how to do it and ideas we could offer our clients. I know I’m not an expert but I can gauge my capability from my progress and feel confident in trying to implement something real and learning as I go.    UX and IA are complementary skills. You don’t need to become a design expert or do hardcore taxonomy work, but the basics will help you ask good questions and check the idea before implementing.

I would personally recommend continuing. The backend, at least in my opinion, is easier than the frontend - you spend less time stuck tweaking tiny details and more time making progress towards your end goal. I would recommend learning a framework like Flask (python) or Rails (Ruby). You can get up and running pretty quickly with one of these. And there are so many resources online to consult.Then you'll have to learn how to deploy your app which is a whole different beast. But if you're considering spending $10,000 on a developer, you could definitely afford something like Heroku which makes deploying quite quick and simple with minimal learning.","What did u learn in terms of front end?If you learned html, css, and JavaScript you could probably pick up NodeJS / ExpressJS pretty quickly!If you also learned a framework on top of html css and js. For example react, angular, vue, some of them offer serverless architecture. I’m a full stack, and know for a fact react has nextjs which is solid, then angular has angular universal. I’ve never tried the latter one angular universal, but I love angular in general so I doubt it’s bad.My opinion tho, regardless would be to pick up NodeJS, if u learned a framework serverless approach could probably get you to where u want to be in a job board app / site, but if you picked up a framework and are comfortable enough with front end, that means you’ve got the skills to be a great experienced engineer. You could easily start building aspects of your backend in a month or two. You might need to re write some stuff once your more comfy but you’ll be good, and this is by far the best approach in my opinion honestly.You’ve got the mindset of a good engineer, and have incredible resilience if you learned all this while working a full time job.Here’s what you do:Learn NodeJS — it’s litterally JavaScript and you just need to learn backend themed stuff. Preferably use ExpressJS as it makes creating endpoints and handling the more raw NodeJS stuff much more cleanly.Once your good on this, maybe play around with socket.io you probably won’t need this in your main app, maybe you will but idk enough about job board development to say. However socket will let you mess around with the backend more freely teaching g you stuff while you learn. This is what helped me at least at the time.Once you got those things, pick up a database. Again not a job board expert, but I’d play it safe and just learn MySQL / MariaDB. You can use ui based platforms like phpmyadmin, and build tables / databases on that platform even on a NodeJS app if you wanted.Alternatively, use an ORM for MySQL, sequelize is really good, and will basically just have you writing classes, methods and models all in JavaScript or typescript, for your database stuff. Still good to know MySQL to actually make something workable ofc.You’ll probably want to get knowledgeable on some of the common types of backend logic. Things such as authentication, endpoints, controllers, routing, http, authorization, middleware, and environmental stuff like npm and json.Sounds hard, but keep in mind all of this stuff will be written in JavaScript. If your comfortable with JavaScript it’ll be similar to an extent. Sure you’ll need to learn more stuff, but it’s so worth it in the end when u can efficiently and confidently build full stack apps.Think about it, if you’re a full stack developer for the web, you can most likely with enough time and effort build anything you can imagine.I’m self taught too, but I did it in college when I had far more time to just sit around and code. Worth it too cause even with no experience in a office environment it landed me a awesome mid level dev role!Idk how much you like ur current job, but learning backend will open a lot of doors and opportunities for you in time!Sorry if this was long:Short Version.Learn NodeJS, you probably learned JavaScript if your comfortable enough with / in front end development, which means you could learn NodeJS just as easily as its litterally js too, you just need to learn backend algorithms and architecture at this point.","10k for a backend ? bro don’t scam yourself you are so close and the quality of the backend for 10k is a complete dice roll on a developer,","Did you do any evaluation on the market for your product?

Models (object) are displayed by views (pages) which you can interact with using a controller (backend logic).Realistically you can learn most frameworks within a couple of weeks, at least we'll enough to get the basics down. I'd recommend picking up a framework such as django or laravel and following a comprehensive tutorial through to the end (it helps to use github commits for each step to make it easier to refer back to the changes in the future). The first steps will be the hardest but hopefully by the end you'll have created an application where models reference eachother and users with different roles can create, update, delete etc models. Take notes throughout and refer back to those.Before trying to transfer what you learn from tutorials to your app make sure you write down what the objects are, what fields they have, and their relationships. It makes it a lot easier if you get those correct from the beginning.The biggest hurdle I faced when building my first production-ready app was setting up the hosting environments. I'd coded the whole thing, it ran on my local, but I'd never done any system administration stuff in the past, or any dns stuff. I was probably being dumb but that may be something to look out for.If you don't have money to commit to marketing this project, or a solid plan for your return on investment then I wouldn't recommend hiring a developer. Don't hire an agency, especially not an overseas one if you don't have at least one staff member on board to clear up their mistakes and maintain the codebase. Code needs to be updated regularly, something that may work one day can (and will) suddenly stop working if you don't touch your code.I spend 80% of my work days fixing code, adding features that were missing or lost in translation, fixing massive security vulnerabilities, maintaining and updating code that was sent to our clients (usually) by overseas agencies. They're cheaper so they're more attractive but they've often got so many projects on the go that by the time you notice the problems, they'll have moved on to somebody else's project. You might get a back and forth going about fixes but they'll slow down their replies and will become unhelpful. They also don't usually follow the latest coding conventions, and with a couple nasty cases Ive seen, they'd embedded their own CMS within a project which they \"owned the distibution rights to\".

Details in the post","The difference is that a socket keeps a connection open for 2 way communication where either the client or server can send data at any time as long as the connection was started by the client. To mimic this behavior with REST you need something that can either wait for a request to return a result (a promise) or you need to have a way for the remote to respond back to a server (webhook). The browser can't host a webhook so a websocket is a better choice in most cases.","Like client send a req to like the post, server increments the like counter, adds notification to the tray and returns all the notifications (along with the newly added one)This works, but only because the client sends a request at the same time. So you can refresh and send new data at the same time, why not. But if client A liked the post, then client B won't be updated, as they did not send any requests. You could have client B refresh every few seconds or whatever, but that is just wasting traffic most of the time and is not very responsive at all! Imagine a WhatsApp or another chat app that is not instant. Sockets solve this problem by allowing the server to communicate with clients and sending them updated data etc.","There's so much to unpack here... took me a while to realize that by \"socket\" you meant \"websocket\". First time I've seen anything on top of TCP referred to as \"real-time\" too!As a sibling mentioned, HTTP is inherently request-response so your server isn't able to initiate a connection. If you want to notify a client of some state change, you can't. It's the tech version of \"don't call us, we'll call you\"...Websockets are just a fancy form of long polling at the end of the day, you send a http request that gets \"upgraded\" to a websocket connection and the TCP connection remains open instead of closing. They're one of the mechanisms you can use to allow a server to send messages to a client outside of the normal request-response flow.Server-Sent Events are another simpler option. You can also check out the Notifications API (great if you're into PWAs). WebTransport is a newer one coming down the pipe that's not quite ready for prime time yet (thanks Safari).

But it's just syntax differences, after all.I would personally advise against jQuery, though that might be just because I have to work in it every day and I genuinely prefer vanilla js over it.However, if you want the modularity of React without the complexity, might I recommend Svelte. It feels practically like you're using vanilla html, css, and js with a few sprinkles of magic here and there but without all the complexity of hooks and stuff. For instance, when you want to update the dom when a variable is updated, simply update the variable... That's it. It's that simple. Svelte will update the dom when variables are updated (there's some trickiness here and there, but it's soooo simple compared to the competition, trust me).","Maybe you’re a savant, maybe you’re an unfortunate victim of dunning-kruger, who knows?I don’t think it’s weird to grasp the basics in a couple of days.

Not that you couldn't, it's definitely doable, but it'd be a lot less convenient, and would take longer if you were to just code it up in JS. It will also be difficult to maintain.That said, if this is a one-off project that doesn't need to be maintained - go for it. Chances are you'll end up inventing your own framework as you go.

If the auth domain sees a valid login cookie, it simply redirects back. If not, it goes through the normal sign in process. When the user is redirected back to the app, the app stores its own cookie on its own domain so it stops redirecting to auth.Logging out can be tricky. One approach is to store the domain of each signed in app on the auth domain. When signing out, the auth domain hits a logout endpoint on each signed in domain, so that the app can clear its sign in cookie. It can do this by redirecting you to each one in a daisy chain fashion, or by using some JS to hit each URL simultaneously on the logout page, etc.Some years ago when I looked into how Google handled it, they loaded an image tag with the logout url for each domain.

Your customers will want this feature, and implementing it can be challenging.Quite honestly for most small websites a traditional CMS like WordPress provides a really good balance between widespread support, good editing experience and good-enough site performance (as long as you set it up correctly). Headless + static setups can provide a lot of benefits, but those are mostly relevant to larger organizations and more complex use cases. They are more complicated to set up and run given the need for a build step or SSR support.I say this as someone who has built numerous websites with both solutions, and exclusively uses SSG setups for my own product after moving away from contract work (my current framework of choice is Astro, but Gatsby is excellent).

Once you understand how Vue's virtual dom works, you get an idea of areas where it's perfectly safe to bypass it without unwanted side effects. The last time I did Google address autocomplete in Vue, I just manually injected the applicable external scripts and if I remember correctly just used an input ref and basically did everything in vanilla JavaScript. I didn't bother with using any dedicated Google Maps Vue libraries for it.

Spend a few hours on properly planning the rest of your project2.

Do the bare minimum work so the client can't complain about not doing enough workBe honest with yourself and very strict— if a feature looks like polishing work (no matter if it's validation, or design-wise) do not do it.Also, don't forget, you only get better when taking on hard projects, it's tough while in the middle of the project, but eventually you grow from it, can take on bigger projects, you get better at estimating larger scopes and you can hopefully charge more in the future.Keep it up, you're doing great!","Address validation is a nightmare.I've written four modules over the years using a mix of about 7 APIs including the Census API, USPS, UPS, Amazon, Google, ArcGIS, and others in order to get Census Block data.

You'd think Amazon would be really good at it, but oddly enough it was one of the more mediocre (this was ~4 years ago, maybe its gotten better?). Every single one of them has their hang-ups and quirks once you get 10 feet outside a designated city.

That bar is pretty low let me tell you.A bit of advice:Stop worrying about how good or bad you are vs others. It isn't going to fix the problems you are facing. Only one thing will do that is working on them.Plan. I've worked on some massive projects over the years. You know what you want to build. Write out what is needed for it. Do a flow diagram of how the client server and so on are supposed to work. Give yourself a general layout of what screens will look like. Then go back and break all that down into what is needed to make each of those functional.Create a check list. If you get frustrated with something and have a bit of difficulty and are waiting for people to get back to you on one section start working on the other section. This helps if your project is well organized.Organizing a large project. If you give everything a place based on hierarchy and position/relation it will be easier to find something and to manage the project. Front end stuff is in front end back end is in back end app is in app, interface is with interface... Put utility code in with each other. Don't have two unrelated piece of code in the same area. Don't over clutter a file. I'm sure a few people can add to this and have their own methods. Do what works for you. Just organize it so you can find stuff.Ask questions. You can pretty much guarantee you aren't the first person to encounter an issue or not know how to do something. Stack exchange, reddit, other forums, discord all can be useful. Learn to use documentation. Often APIs have a good bit of resource and other websites. You already mentioned videos. But sometimes just asking is faster.You will find by working on the system in increments like this will see progress which will make you feel better. You won't be as daunted by having a huge task in front of you, you will be more focused on solving smaller tasks that seem less insurmountable. You can also plan and schedule them better.In 2011 I got the bright idea to create my own social media site. Called paidtopen. (Paid To Pen). The site worked fine just couldn't get people to it.

I generally recommend going as bare bones as possible to start. And planning the project out as a phased implementation. This allows the initial phases to be smaller and more proof of concept. Allows you to focus on the specific functionality the client wants, before expanding it out to a full service.It also allows the client to use you for an MVP of the project and if you end up over your head or don't like working with the client, you can part ways.If you've already hired freelancers and are still running into this problem, you need to look for freelancers with experience in building a SaaS, or platform style architecture.

It's your responsibility to be confident enough and knowledgeable enough to blaze a path forward, even if you can't see it. You accomplish through planning, due diligence, and research, and ultimately, just throwing yourself at the problem.Nobody learns anything by not being challenged. We all struggle to figure things out sometimes, and it's okay. Overcoming that is what makes us better devs. Many people here say you're in over your head, and that may be so, but you have a choice here. You can keep pushing and deliver the best product you can put together, or you can back out and let your insecurities win. I know the latter sounds kinda harsh, but it's not. Someone else's time and money is on the line, so I couldn't judge you for accepting that you're not good enough. But to an extent, it's a choice you can make.I've been in your position before, and I refunded my client because I realized the projects scope was far above what I could've managed on my own. Looking back, I feel I undersold myself. In the near future, I'd be responsible for projects just as expansive as a solo dev at a company and I never felt that I could just easily back out because I wasn't knowledgeable enough. People were depending on me, so I buckled up and figured it out. Sometimes that's just what you have to do, frustrations and uncertainty and all.And if you ultimately underdeliver and the client is not happy, it's not the end of the world.

It's for the same reason you can solve it in an hour now – we solved it before in many more hours.Here's some advice, though:Do a research/experimentation phase at the beginning of the project. You likely knew early on that you'd need the autocomplete feature working together with the form and map libraries. I would have done several small experiments, like implementing a custom validation rule for the form library and another for the map features, etc..During this experimentation, I would have spent significant time on the libraries' documentation and code, researching new ones, or creating my own libraries.This research and experimentation aren't a waste of time in my opinion. They allow you to finish the actual project much faster and with fewer frustrating problems.","I find doing small chunks of work is best for my own projects.

For example, that might mean a user can sign up, create a project, and invite someone to their team. Something like an autocomplete input sounds very nuanced, maybe not even critical for success, and i would save those sort of things until the end so they don't get you hung up.Then at the end you can say \"well look, the whole project WORKS, it turned out my estimates were low, so its not POLISHED..\" and you can re-negotiate a fee to do all the polishing.This is also why i always have a weekly check-in with my client to demo what i've done so far and what i'm doing next week. It helps me stay in check, we also usually come up with new ideas/questions i hadn't thoguht of before, or places i can cut scope.","Engineering estimates are always going to be wrong, don't beat yourself up over it.

The only wrinkle is if you do cross-border functionality, and need to swap out the APIs based on country.Still, congrats on getting this figured out.

You were likely the lowest bidder and just like the programmer on Jurassic Park, your client isn't responsible for your poor business decisions. I hope you kept track of how many hours you an others spent on the project when it is finished and you divide your investments and effort into what you bid for this project. If you come back with less than $80/hour you were providing a charity service. You are in business to make money so the development and delivery effort should not only cover your costs, you should make at least 20% profit on the project. If it costs you $80K to do it, then you should have charged at least $96K for the project.","Programming really hard, why pay well.","happens to the best, today is simply not your day","This happens to many of us. In the last few months i was working on a project where i have to get data from google big query for investment.

So the apis only allow 1 order placement at one call, but my client had portfolios with 50,60 investments and i need to place all of them right away.Snaptrade has a limit of 100 apis per minute but they add seconds timestamp in api url and if you hit concurrently, you will get errors and none of the transactions will be completed.I made 1 second timeout promises, set conditions for errors like add failed transactions with details in array then count how many trades failed and then add throttle for 60 seconds if i get error before i hit api again etc. did all of the hard-working and still every time i get some type of error and end up cancelling the order. It was a nightmare and won't work on this kind of order again.","Sometimes a task that should take 5 minutes takes an hour. Sometimes a task that you allocate a whole day to takes half an hour.

I wanted to quickly implement a Google Autocomplete input in my existing form to ensure that users enter valid addresses. First, I had issues changing the database structure, then the Vue Google Maps library had an issue so I had to switch it, setting an initial value didn't work, and then I had issues implementing a custom validation rule into the form library I'm using. Now, I'm trying to figure out how I can trigger the input with the initial values, which is just a formatted address string so I can retrieve the latitude and longitude values.Time spent on this task: 5 hours. I wanted to finish this task today and failed. Some of you probably would have finished this task in less than 1 hour. Now, I'm seriously wondering if I'm the worst programmer on the planet or if this is a struggle every programmer faces.Man you can't look at it like that when you are leading things. My answer here is that when you are in a position like it sounds like you are, you need to have your hands in everything and know when to back off and call it a day with certain tasks. You need to not get too discouraged when you fail at any one of those tasks.Multitasking is important. You need to devote your time and mental energy to any given task at hand but you need to try to avoid \"spinning your wheels\" on any of them. Some spinning of the wheels is OKAY. It really is. 5 hours isn't bad. It's not an absurd amount of time to spend on some problem like this. I've spent more. I mean, I've spent a lot more. And at the end it was worth it for me learning the technology.You're in a unique position where it sounds like the project is uniquely dependent on you. Try to use your time wisely, but don't beat yourself up mentally when you waste 5 hours on some task you could have solved in a minute, had you known better. You didn't know better, and it sounds like you didn't have anyone around you who did. Take it as a win that you progressed on the task, not a loss, even if you didn't complete the task.The longer you sit at any one problem without making some kind of progress on it, the more discouraging everything becomes. You need to have multiple things on your plate at any one time, that you can switch between. Not a lot of things, 2-3, maybe 4. The key here is that you are always making progress and that you aren't sitting there spinning your wheels.Hit the gas pedal, and once you realize you're just sitting there spinning your wheels, and you're losing steam and the will to go on, that's the time you should switch to another task. Let your brain stew on the problem while you do something easier. Keep your focus on the smallest possible thing that you can find to accomplish to further your end ultimate goal. It's like building a pyramid. Block by block by block by block by block. Just focus on each block and ignore the insurmountability of actually creating the entire pyramid. Eventually you'll end up with a pyramid.And you'll avoid being discouraged while you're building it. These things you sit and spin your wheels at, I mean you should try to spread those out if you can. Sometimes you can't, especially if you're the \"top person\" who everyone else goes to for questions. But you need to just keep your eye on the prize and learn to sideline things when you aren't able to progress on them, and to not lose hope when they take a long time for you to actually progress. Eventually, you will, if you keep at it. If you can look around and see other people doing some cool thing with web dev technology, chances are good that you can too, with a bit of work.","Did I post this? Lol.Jokes aside.

Maybe in a vacuum I could do that in an hour but with pre-planning and setup. I've been working as a solo dev on a large saas for 3 years and the answer is to be more honest about what YOUR skills are. If it takes you all week to do that form with those features then they may reduce the requirements. Don't take it personally. If you had the knowledge and experience to go that fast, you'd also know just how rare that is.","Some frameworks and tech stacks are simply not polished/finished enough. It seems many of your problems come from the selection of the technologies used to develop your solution.I delivered successfully a project using Python's FastAPI, and after finishing this project, I consider SQLAlchemy a very immature library, lacking things that are standard in the PHP world. I can't take an ORM object, modify some fields and save it back to the DB. No, for some reason they decided ORM objects are all read-only. This takes away half of the reasons to use an ORM. I can write SQL myself, there is no advantage having to write convoluted SQL in the form of function calls if it is not going to reduce any work later.FastAPI is also incompatible with some simple things like using brackets in query variable names to denote they are arrays, and the funny thing is: that worked when I started doing the project, then some FastAPI update broke it, and the API users had to update the code because there was no way to make it work again with the latest FastAPI version.And this is an extremely popular library in an extremely popular language, which is supposedly easy to use.In contrast, some other tools, not very popular, are extremely well-developed and tested. I am talking about QT Creator, using C++. In theory, C++ is harder to use than Python. In practice, everything is wonderfully documented, and everything works on the first try, and the QT extensions to the language, Signals and Slots are just better than any kind of callback functions.","This seems quite common. My advice is to don’t freak out. Just finish one part until it’s in a state with no apparent bugs and well tested and then move on to the next part of the app. Jumping between unfinished part is the worst thing you can do, I.e. loosing control of the bugs. You must also be able to handle the communication with the client in case you can’t deliver in time. It’s very common to miss deadlines. For me it’s rather a rule.","You suck at estimating how much time some tasks take to do.

You are not prioritizing properly the work that needs to be done.FIRST you do the basic features, then you improve the user experience.In a good team, you would have someone in a manager-type role that would prioritize your work for you. But you are working alone, so your job is not only programming - it's both programming and managing yourself.It seems you are failing mainly at the managerial aspects of your job, NOT in the programming aspects.edit: you said elsewhere that the client is considering this as part of the MVP.

Consider organizing your development skills as follows:Languages: Start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.Tech Stack: List tools like Git, React, NPM, and CMS (e.g., WordPress).Design Tools: Include software like Figma.Methodologies: Mention practices like Test-Driven Development (TTD).Experience & Projects:Avoid including unfinished projects in your portfolio. You want to showcase completed work that reflects your skills effectively. Ensure that all listed projects are finished before you begin applying for jobs. Since your portfolio already contains detailed project information, you may consider removing this section entirely.Education:Consider adding \"The Odin Project Bootcamp\" under the Education section rather than listing it as additional training. This bootcamp is one of your most valuable educational experiences, so provide details such as duration and specific skills learned.Other:Remove the third page from your resume as there is nothing on it.In general, I would suggest using a tabular resume format.
