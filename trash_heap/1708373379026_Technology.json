But mixed into that hiring season, executives approved head counts without first determining their business true need for additional employees in the workflow.Now, teams are handling more work because the employees that were once staffed are now gone. Companies paid out way too much revenue for more workers. Now, they need to save money.Specifically for my company, executive leadership should have first restructured their departments. Yes, it would suck. But instead of laying off employees during the pandemic, you restructured teams to balance the work left by employees that resigned/quit. Then, you identify which areas need help. Then, you hire to fill in those gaps.What my company did? Over hire. Restructured. Then, laid off in massive amounts.The end result today: teams have more work and not enough help.
