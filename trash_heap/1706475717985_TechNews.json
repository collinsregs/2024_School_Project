[{"text":["Sextortion is fastest-growing crime targeting minors in North America ‚Äì and social media companies can do more to stop it, study finds","I‚Äôve been in the comments and advocating for comprehensive sex Ed to address this as well as bodily autonomy and consent. What was shocking at the time and less so upon reflection is just how young these sextortion crimes happen.Realistically the coordinated attacks by groups like the Yahoo Boys or their copy cats, when combined with lack of supervision and precocious puberty, it seems like we need education on this for 5th and 6th graders and even that might be too late. You can preach ‚Äúdon‚Äôt send nudes‚Äù until you‚Äôre blue in the face, but until they read about how quickly lives are destroyed and know the dangers, it won‚Äôt help them.Social media companies need to act on this, and fast, but parents have to step up because this can be solved in part through education.","Had this happen when I was 16Ended up paying 200$ and nearly dying of panic thinking my life was ruinedI still wonder if that image of me is somewhere out their floating around on the internetSuffice to say I never did that again but it was incredibly frightening and I think it‚Äôs sick they target minors","Just finished reading about the (adult) romance scams also done from some countries (Ghana in this case). The oddest feature is that the criminals are often controlled by ‚Äúpriests ‚Äú who bestow magical powers of persuasion on the criminals in return for a cut of the money.","Of course they can!!!!! We ALL CAN except men rely on sexual exploitation or turn a blind eye to it because it does t affect them.What I love is the irony of telling girls:Don‚Äôt SEND any sexy pictures of yourself or sextortion is your fault.DONT TAKE any sexy pictures of yourself or sextortion is your fault.And now we‚Äôve got Deepfakes and AI soNow what: we can‚Äôt put our faces online? Maybe cover up! Maybe stay home!I guess until we have laws girls are free game because none of this is ‚Äúreal‚Äù anyway and we can all use some plausible deniability.","I have a sick feeling this is gonna get even worse with AI and deepfakes.","People are sick.Not only are we in times where depression, mental issues, loneliness, and suicide is rampant but people are trying to profit off of it as well."],"points":0},{"text":["Apple was just forced to crack open its App Store ‚Äî but the changes are already being called 'hot garbage'","98% of people buy Apple for the ecosystem.","I don‚Äôt care about openness in an iPhone.

Definitely the best when it comes to citizens privacy right.","So someone will go to jail? Someone will lose a job (and not be allowed to return)?No?Just telling them they must delete the data... and no verification that's done or that it won't happen again?OK then, carry on, nothing to see here.","I wonder who else is buying the same information","Wydan said that he was \"not aware of any requirement in US law or judicial opinion\" forcing the DoD to \"obtain a court order in order to acquire, access, or use\" commercially available information that \"is equally available for purchase to foreign adversaries, US companies, and private persons as it is to the US government.\"","I‚Äôm disgusted by the fact that my tax dollars are going to buying my own data. Cut out the middleman and pay me, I‚Äôll give you my data.","I don‚Äôt care that the NSA bought the information. It is way more chilling that the information was there to be purchased at all, by anyone.","Corporations more powerful than government of course","Purchasing our personal information with our own tax dollars..","Wtf, just purchase it directly from me in the form of a tax rebate and stop going through the middleman.","I have to renew my license at the DMV, and they require an appointment and use a third party scheduler.I submitted the required personal info in the form, which is personal personal, and not even 30 minutes later and for several days after I received hot lead telemarketing calls and voicemails nonstop. What the fuck?","Can I purchase my information back? I've forgotten all my passwords","*government admits that corporations putting profits over people is now inextricably linked to state surveillance of said people.","Wait till people find out what they won't admit to.","Love me some North Korea err ‚Äòmerka","Be real, data brokers are literally just CIA fronts to skirt the law.

Panties are knotted and small children panicked because US intelligence agencies purchased data which is readily available on the open market. Yet people willingly sign service agreements with social media entities that waive their rights and release their data to private corporate entities to do with it whatever they choose. Sheer idiocy.","Everyone here is targeting the wrong organization. The issue isn‚Äôt that the NSA buys it in support of its mission to defend the US. The issue is that this data is for sale to begin with. If the US government stops using it, we‚Äôre making it harder on ourselves when EVERYONE ELSE gets to continue to buy the data (criminals, adversary nation states, other companies, political organizations, etc.). The NSA is not the threat. The business model of collecting and selling the data en mass is the vulnerability, all the other people using it against us are the threat.","And this is why it will never be illegal to sell personal data.","Tomorrow‚Äôs news: NSA finally admits to spying on Americans by having telephone company delivery directories to its offices.","So yippee, they know I've given up on life and just hanging around hoping to watch it all end.

It‚Äôs actually legal for them to do this ever since the Patriot Act got introduced. Does not mean I agree with this at all. I think it‚Äôs downright egregious","So we pardon Snowden next right?","I trust the CIA more than the NSA","Anybody else seriously disappointed? The spying yes, but also having to resort to data brokers. All those mathematicians, cryptanalysts, compromising agreements with NIST, telco trunk taps for naught when someone else does the job better.","how is this news? everyone knows your phone spies on you","Did anyone expect otherwise? Privacy died years ago. Move on","Oops. We broke the law again. What are you going to do about it? Nothing? Yeah, that's what we thought.
