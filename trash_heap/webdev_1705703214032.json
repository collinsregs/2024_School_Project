Whenever you create a var/object/array, it is in memory.If you're dealing with lots of data you can offload it to something like indexedDB which lets you write large amounts of structured data to disk rather than memory, and has an SQL-like syntax for setting/getting data. For me if it's >2MB of data I start thinking about more robust solutions than just chucking everything in to const myArray = [];","Big array3000 elementsWhat?","Once a variable assignment is executed in the interpreter, it stays fully in memory until cleaned up. You can optimize memory by assigning smaller arrays, work with querying libraries to parse and organize big data files, query from a database, etc... but you can't load array elements in and out of memory without having to load them back in again from somewhere.","Even though this is web development I'd still recommend learning the basics about memory allocation, the stack, heap, etc. Not in a condescending manor, it's just really useful to know.All array elements are loaded into memory when the array is filled. If you know that you have 3000 elements to load but you typically only need a small portion at any given time you can look into methods of breaking that array into smaller pieces. Like pagination but I believe the technical term would be more like sharding. It really depends on your requirements.","Arrays are in memory to begin with. They're \"filled\" (not disallowing empty slots though).If you want something that's \"lazy\", you'd want an Iterator or Generator instead, and may be particularly interested in the Iterator helpers proposal.However, for both of those, they're \"consume once.\" In checking if they contain an item, you'd have to \"consume\" them, at least up to that point. No reset or go back methods (not to be confused with NodeIterator, which doesn't actually implement the Iterator protocol).But, for your example, if you're wanting the performance benefit and specifically decreased memory, you could have something like the following 'const nums = Iterator.range(0, Infinity) .map(n => toNumberWord(n));As far as getting a subset from an Iterator, you could use the take() and drop() methods.That wouldn't all be in memory at once, and the map callback would be \"lazy\" as well, called for each iteration individually as-needed instead of up-front all at once. Same would go for a filter(), etc.But, again, these are consumed when used. If you did:nums.find(num => num.length > 6)That would advance the iterator and you can't go back to the beginning.","As others have said, an Array is by definition an object that is allocated in memory.But maybe your question is not so much about saving memory, but how to access data only when its needed ?An Array doesn't have to be filled with data initially, for instance the following:const myArr = new Array(3000);declares an Array myArr that has 3000 slots. The memory allocated is for the Array object only and its \"slots\". However, all of its slots are empty and consume no additional memory for content (as in JS this is dynamically allocated for non-typed Arrays). You can assign a value like so:myArr[147] = \"content\";Now 2999 slots are empty while the slot at index 147 now contains value \"content\". This value is a String type and allocates memory (in JS Strings are always unique instances and cannot be referenced, even when the content is the same as in another String variable).You can write your program in such a way that you only populate values as you need them. Then in your example slots 0 to 146 remain empty, while you only add a value at 147.BUTAt this point you can wonder whether an Array is the right data type for your purpose. Basically, if you need a list of items to be available instantly, an Array is a good choice (a Map can be equally useful). If you only need to show one item at a time and you can afford to fetch this data asynchronously (for instance from a server), maybe you only need to have a single variable for your \"item\" data. Then again, if you expect to user to go back and forth between items, you might want to store the previously fetched data in the Array to prevent making another request to your server. Depending on the size of the Array and the size of the content, memory allocation may not be an issue at all.So maybe its good to know what data this Array stores and what your use case is =)","you can also use a different structure that is not fully loaded to do the job. For example, an array of objects, each object being a \"page\", containing an smaller array, info like is it is loaded, start index and size. arr[0] -> { page[0..100], start: 0, size: 100 } arr[1] -> { page[0..100], start: 100, size: 100 }Then you need to optimize the loading, where you get data from a server into your structure, you could load just the parts you need right away. You could implement loading on demand and even reusing the arrays, to hold just the pages which are frequently used.Other methods would be to use streams or interators (not all languages support them for objects you create).","Array lookup is constant time"],"points":52},{"text":["Manage all your Laravel projects in one place, boosting productivity and collaboration."],"points":0},{"text":["How to implement location services","Never actually done something like this, but played with google maps few times.

Consent shouldn't last in perpetuity.Starting out, if you're collecting PII and storing it in a database, especially an app that accepts payments, it should be trivial to also store consent agreements.

These are websites where the user doesn't really do much except look at them. Think personal websites, portfolios, small business' websites. Something you could make with wix.More difficult would be something that does require JavaScript, the easiest example I can think of being the quintessential todo list app. These are usually written using a JavaScript framework like React or Vue. The more functionality it has, the more complicated the website is. For example, a todo list app that allows users to create an account, save their todos online, edit and delete them, and search for other people's todos would be much more advanced than the basic todo list app. These websites may require a simple backend to store information. Also in this category (but on the easier side) would be websites that use a CMS to manage content.The most advanced websites are complex software where the website itself is the product. For example, e-commerce sites like Amazon, social media sites, or software-as-a-service (SaaS). These usually require whole teams of developers.This is all just my subjective opinion, but I hope this helped!","simple and advanced websites in terms of HTML and CSSPeople are going to misread your question and tell you that anything javascript-y is advanced.​Simple website (in terms of html and css):Everything is a <div>, you don't have much custom css, you're using a pre-built UI-kit or css framework (bootstrap, bulma, materialUI, etc). Ironically this is the bucket most \"advanced\" webapps are in because a lot of react devs like js and don't like html or css.​Normal website (in terms of html and css):Almost everything is a <div> (but one person on the team has started learning semantic html, so you'll see the occasional <section> or <time>), you have a little more custom css because you've realized bootstrap isn't exactly what you want, there are a LOT of 3rd-party dependencies as the devs try to \"npm i\" their way out of design and dev problems .​Advanced website (in terms of html and css):The right element gets used for the right purpose (semantic html). You have properly built forms with pattern validation and autocomplete. Modern css gets consistently applied across the board: custom props, modern layout (grid/flex), transitions/animations, etc. The native stack is privileged over 3rd-party deps, but there are probably a few carefully vetted deps to meet specific functionality requirements.","Why do you ask the question?

But there are linters for many languages.In general, a linter shows your possible bugs and other stuff in your IDE or in a terminal.I am mainly developing modules for magento2 and magento2 has its own coding standard, that can be imported to codesniffer. So codesniffer (or in my case an vscode extension) shows me errors or warns, if something is not best practice or if a class is deprecated etc.Here is a short video about linters in general:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDQXWr5TOnI","You shouldn't; you should have someone else review it for you: 1. Bias: When you review your own code, you may unconsciously overlook mistakes or areas for improvement because you are already familiar with the logic and reasoning behind it. This bias can lead to missed issues. 2. Limited Perspective: Code review benefits from diverse perspectives. Another developer may bring a fresh set of eyes and different experiences to the review, which can uncover issues you might not have considered. 3. Confirmation Bias: There's a tendency to see what you expect to see. When you review your own code, you might subconsciously validate your assumptions, making it more difficult to spot errors or inefficiencies. 4. Time Constraints: Code review can be time-consuming, and when you review your own code, you might be tempted to rush through it, missing important issues in the process. 5. Complexity: Complex code can be challenging to review objectively, especially if you've spent a lot of time working on it. It's easy to miss subtle bugs or improvements that someone else might spot. 6. Communication: Code reviews are also an opportunity for knowledge sharing and collaboration within a team. Reviewing your own code deprives others of this chance to understand and learn from your work. 7. Quality Assurance: Code reviews are an integral part of quality assurance. They help maintain code quality and identify potential issues before they become major problems. Self-review may not be as effective in achieving this goal.To mitigate these issues, it's generally a good practice to have peer code reviews where other members of your team review your code, and you review theirs. This promotes collaboration, helps catch errors early, and ultimately leads to higher-quality code.edit: fix markdown formatting","Check yout sonarqube / sonarlint and the https://sonarcloud.io tools, it gives you a lot of information on your code quality.","The most honest code review is opening it 6 months later to add something.","For personal/solo projects, follow similar processes that you would in a professional team setting. For example: create branches, submit PRs, require PRs pass certain automated checks before they can be merged.After you create the PR, do a quick once over to see if anything stands out (comment on those things like you would if it were a teammates PR). Then go make coffee or take a walk around the block and review the PR again with a bit fresher eyes. If you have the ability to work on something else and let the PR sit a day before your second review, even better!Ultimately though, static analysis tools / linters will be your most effective ally. For JavaScript, it’s things like eslint, prettier, and typescript (even if it’s just type checking in JS via jsdoc). For PHP, it’s PHP-CS-Fixer and PHPstan (Laravel has additional tools). Regardless of language, make sure to use SonarLint!And if you want to be on the cutting edge, there are a handful of decent AI code review tools available.","Imagine someone else is reviewing your code, and you're stepping them through it.

More recent work or more position-specific work merits more details, but all of your work is so recent that you don't need to worry about that yet.For example, when you say:Resolved Memory Leakage Issues in Next.js Application for Enhanced Stability. Identified and addressed memory leakage issues within the Next.js application through detailed debugging and analysis. Utilized tools and built-in Next.js profiling to pinpoint memory hotspots and implemented best practices, resulting in a more stable and resource-efficient application.Some things that stand out:Resolved Memory Leakage Issues... - weird capitalization, and this part isn't needed since it's explained right afterwards. Just remove it.memory leakage issues - leakage sounds weird and all memory leaks worth mentioning are issues. Remove issues and just say \"memory leaks\". Specify if they were front-end or back-end, data issues or rendering issues, as this highlights something about your skill set.Utilized tools - \"Utilized tools\" is unnecessarily wordy. It works to sound smart in high-school essays, but the working world is about brevity, and of course you used tools. Stick with \"use\" instead of \"utilize\" everywhere in your CV and say what tools you used.You could say:Identified memory leaks in the client-side JavaScript using performance analysis and profiling tools, and refactored for a more resource-efficient and stable application.In 5 years when this experience becomes older or less relevant this could be even shorter, so the whole 2-year contract could fit on a few lines:Identified and addressed memory leaks in the client-side JavaScript.I'd be happy to take a look at any changes you have.
