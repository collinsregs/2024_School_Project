They're encrypted and the transformer at the power entrance to the home isolates the signal from getting outside.Or you can get a wifi adapter via USB, possibly as an expansion card if the PC has internal slots available.","I'd recommend a USB Wifi adapter too like everyone else says. But considering you're multiple floors away from the router, I can't imagine the connection would be very good. Though, considering the circumstances, it seems like that's the only option.Also, why is the router in the basement? That sounds like bad network optimization? Is that thing serving the the whole house/building? What's the connection like?","his computer is multiple floors away from the router.This means that the suggestions for a WiFi adapter are probably not going to do the job. To verify, go to where the PC will be, turn off cell on your phone and just use WiFi. Then do a speed test from Speedtest.net and see how good, or bad, the connection is. You can also load an app called WiFiman on your phone and measure the signal strength directly. Anything weaker than -70 dBm will be problematic.The Powerline adapters others have mentioned will be your best bet if the WiFi signal's too weak in his room. Here's an article on it explaining what it is and how it works, What is Powerline?.Like any tech stuff they have their pluses and minuses. In a situation like you have though they are your best bet. At the most basic installation you run a short Ethernet cable from the router to the adapter that's plugged into a wall socket near the router. At the other end you have an adapter plugged into a wall socket and an ethernet cable from it to the PC. There are kits that add extras, like the distant adapter generating it's on WiFi signal, or a power pass through so you don't lose access to the outlet for something else.Tp-Link probably has the best bang for the buck with it's adapters with basic ones in the $40-50 range.","The power adapter others are referring to is called EOP (Ethernet over power). Research it before you go down that rabbit hole.","Put the pc next to the router. Now you don't need a long cable!","You could look into powerline adapters. They aren't terrific, but in a pinch they'll do.","A wifi extender isn't that bad, or maybe a PLC solution (LAN through the wall plug)","I ran an ethernet cable down the register pipe going to my router in the basement.

You could plug the dongle directly into your pc, but the (probably metal) case itself may prevent good reception.

If your phone is overheating there's likely an issue with the CPU cooling which is causing the phone to shut itself off rather than burn up.This is the same thing that happens with PC's after long periods of time. It sounds like you're probably in need of a new phone or (if possible) some fix of the CPU cooling internally.The other reason I wouldn't disable this protection is if your phone catches fire and bursts your battery, you could very easily burn down your entire house/apartment. It's there for a reason.","Overheating PROTECTION is exactly that: protection. You wouldn't remove the temperature sensor of your car to allow it to run as hot as it can.You can flash custom kernels and ROMs if you have unlocked your bootloader and they may have a different throttling pattern that prevents it to shutdown, but it will run crazy slow to not produce more heat.Sounds like it's time to disassemble the phone and see what happened with the thermal interface. Perhaps it degraded and the CPU is no longer making contact with the metal heatsink","If you remove overheat protection, your phone will just overheat."],"points":2},{"text":["Yahoo Redirect","If you suspect you may have malware on your computer, or are trying to remove malware from your computer, please see our malware guidePlease ignore this message if the advice is not relevant.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Matching the timings doesn't matter because the motherboard will just adjust the clocks to match the slowest stick.What actually matters is getting the two sticks as identical as possible which is impossible to do by looking at a stat sheet or the purchasing page. The vendors that sell RAM don't actually make it, they just assemble it. All RAM vendors buy parts from SK Hynix, Samsung, Micron/Spectec or Nanya. You want to match the manufacturer and chipset version on the sticks (With RAM the chipset is often called the Die). Each vendor has their own tech for the chipset and different naming schemes, getting a different manufacturer drastically lowers the chance of them working together. This is also annoying even if you get the exact same model number RAM as they will change who they buy RAM from before every batch if they can get a better price from a different manufacturer. A later produced batch can be as different from an earlier one as any other random kit even though they have the same model number. QVLs will often list the manufacturer and you sometimes see the same model number kit 3-5 times on the list with different component manufacturers.The only way of knowing this information is after you already bought it. Corsair has a sticker on the RAM sticks where it says \"Version\" and a version number which isn't actually the version, but an in-house code for who made it and which version chipset was used. For others you have to use tools to read the memory information like Thaiphoon Burner.Another important thing to match are the ranks of the RAM. This is usually shown in the spec sheet and on the purchasing page though. It's how many memory chips are on each stick of RAM and how they are set up. Both of your kits are 1xR8 which means single rank of 8 chips.Different capacity can also be an issue.This is why all RAM vendors put in small print at the bottom of the page something like \"Only sticks purchased in the same kit are designed to work together\".Then we have the issue of four sticks just being way harder on the memory controller (Part of the CPU). Some kits just won't work with four sticks no matter what you do with certain CPU and motherboard combos. If you look at the QVL (Qualified Vendor List, a list of pre-tested RAM motherboard vendors make) for AMD motherboards at least (AMD had huge issues with their memory controller on first and second gen Ryzen so I became very familiar with them because I post here a lot) almost half of the kits doesn't pass quality control when using four sticks due to instability.
