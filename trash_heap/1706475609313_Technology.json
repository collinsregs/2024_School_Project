Most of them have fairly narrow geographical reaches and loads. Think Amazon delivery vans, garbage trucks and 18 wheelers that bring produce and other food products from suburban distribution centers to big grocery stores every day. None of these trucks anywhere in the world have any problems at all with running on batteries. Range and load just aren‚Äôt issues.As a case in point, Pepsi is now running 21 Tesla Semis on regular routes of up to 450 miles to and from its Sacramento, California distribution center. They are carrying Frito Lay potato chips and full loads of soft drinks.In September 2023 a large data gathering event occurred, the \"Run on Less\" event organized by the North American Council for Freight Efficiency (NACFE). The loads, routes and charging of 22 different electric semi trucks from multiple manufacturers being used by different organizations in different parts of the USA were captured and compared. While Tesla‚Äôs Semi and charging were head and shoulders above the rest, trucks from other vendors were easily doing 150 miles and up a day with real loads and routes.There‚Äôs a lot of noise about Class 8 trucks and weight which even the empirical reality of Tesla hauling Pepsi hundreds of miles isn‚Äôt putting to bed. But weight of trucks and potential damage to roads are red herrings.Current battery electric semi tractors are heavier than fully fueled long-haul diesel tractors. Battery energy density today still requires a lot of batteries to achieve the ranges Tesla and other manufacturers are delivering. In the USA, Class 8 trucks are limited to a loaded vehicle weight of 80,000 pounds, about 36 metric tons. Most jurisdictions have permitted electric semis to be 2% to 3% heavier.When I discussed this with David Cebon, founder of the Centre for Sustainable Road Freight, roads expert and mechanical engineering professor at Cambridge earlier this year he made a few points worth repeating.Class 8 trucks are simply the lowest common denominator for freight trucks in North America. Every country and state allows them to operate, so they can freely cross borders. However, many US states such as Michigan already allow much heavier trucks on their roads, in that case over double the 80,000 pounds. Class 8 is a regulatory convenience, not a hard limit, and allowing electric Class 8 trucks to be slightly heavier is not an issue.The decades-ago US study which found an exponential relationship between the weight on axles and road damage was deeply flawed. A two-year study on a closed loop had significant frost heave damage in the second year, this wasn‚Äôt accounted for and then the statistical study itself was further botched. Despite this, it became an accepted rule of civil engineering and an anti-EV meme.It‚Äôs been thoroughly debunked, including by Cebon himself long before he turned to decarbonization of trucking. Much heavier trucks than fully loaded Class 8 electric trucks are already running on roads globally and if the road damage claims were true, all of those roads would be rubble in months.But what about range? Clearly we already have a very large part of the trucking industry‚Äôs operational requirements met with current batteries. But trucks run a lot further than 450 miles in long-haul trucking. The longest range on a US diesel truck is around 2,100 miles when fully fueled, and the USA, as far as I can tell, relies far more on trucking for freight movement than most geographies.Is that within the range of battery electric energy densities? It certainly is. The world‚Äôs largest EV battery manufacturer, China‚Äôs CATL, started manufacturing and shipping a battery with twice the energy per unit of weight as the ones in Tesla‚Äôs trucks and cars this year. It‚Äôs initially focused on the electric aviation market, but will be selling it for road vehicles in 2024. The 450 miles becomes 900 miles on a single charge, and the over 1,000 miles one of the Semis traveled in a single day on its rounds potentially increases to 1,500 miles or more including time at very high speed chargers.That‚Äôs with batteries commercially available right now. Four different organizations that I‚Äôm aware of in multiple countries have overcome the technical challenges and are commercializing silicon battery chemistries. The theoretical energy density maximum is five times that of CATL‚Äôs new batteries. Only doubling it is required to provide equivalent range as diesel semis viable with a lighter tractor and hence more load.Most analyses which dismiss batteries for trucking make assumptions that batteries are not still improving rapidly on metrics of price and energy density.But still, that doesn‚Äôt solve the system problem. We need to get electricity into those new batteries. Different countries have different rules for drivers, with the USA allowing them to drive far longer with fewer rests than Europe. Europe‚Äôs rules provide lots of time for charging as do the USA‚Äôs with the new batteries and very high speed chargers.But we have to get very high speed chargers into truck stops and get the electricity to the truck stops. In many parts of the world, this isn‚Äôt particularly onerous. In the long rural routes of the USA with its relatively weak grid, it‚Äôs a bit more challenging. Tesla solved this for its cars by building the world‚Äôs most reliable inter-city high-speed charging network, something it‚Äôs doing on four continents. Tesla is making its 1 MW power Megacharger the new standard in its network, so every Tesla Supercharger location will be able to charge Tesla Semis. Other vendors will catch up.Even before that, with a range with CATL batteries of 900 miles, a Tesla Semi would only have to charge up twice in the middle of the country to cross the entirety of the USA. It‚Äôs not onerous to build sufficient chargers initially for a small number of electric trucks and keep adding to them every year. It‚Äôs not like we have to electrify every truck stop tomorrow.The power requirements are easily managed with batteries at the charging locations to buffer and arbitrage electricity. There are studies with very bad assumptions about battery energy densities and prices which try to pretend that delivering three times as much electricity to refueling stations to make hydrogen for truck fuel is somehow almost as cheap or that sending 14 times as many tankers with hydrogen to truck stops to support them is remotely reasonable, but they don‚Äôt stand up to scrutiny and should be ignored. At this point you have to have a significant bias for hydrogen to claim that it‚Äôs required or competitive.But there are challenges with this model as well. Autonomous trucking and autonomous platooning of freight trucks is a foregone conclusion, even if promised delivery timetables have slipped. That‚Äôs going to have an inevitable downward pressure on required rest stops. And automated loading and unloading of tractors at depots is putting downward pressure on the time available when the truck is receiving or discharging its load. However, given that energy costs for electric trucking are so much lower than diesel even without pricing carbon, I just see this as an operational optimization exercise, one which I have every faith in the logistics expertise of trucking firms to resolve.Cebon and I spoke about another alternative which he favors and I consider less likely to be necessary, which is putting overhead trolley wires above lanes of heavy trucking routes and adding extensible connectors ‚Äî pantographs ‚Äî to the top of semi tractors. This is completely technically viable, is a century old technology used with buses, trolleys and heavy trains globally and would enable the semis to both run on grid electricity and charge their batteries for periods off the highway. And it‚Äôs entirely possible to put range extending generators on trucks running biodiesel for really odd circumstances.There‚Äôs nothing technically difficult about these options, and it‚Äôs likely that they will be used in some places as interim solutions until very high speed chargers and high-energy density batteries are everywhere.Is there any real world evidence to support massive electrification of trucking? Yes, there is. China has over 500,000 electric trucks on its roads already and is adding more daily. Meanwhile there are rounding error numbers of trucks with hydrogen and other alternatives to batteries and electric motors. The test has been run. Battery electric won.The USA‚Äôs transportation blueprint and hydrogen strategy are both based on broken assumptions and bad faith efforts to justify hydrogen, driven in large part by Congress forcing the authors to give the US fossil fuel industry a future. Similar problems exist in Europe, where they are intending to build a massive hydrogen pipeline effort assuming hydrogen will be shipped to ports like Rotterdam for use in transportation and heating applications.But these efforts to perpetuate the hydro in hydrocarbon will crash on the shoals of physics and economics, the Scylla and Charybdis of hydrogen for energy. Just as with everything else, the future of trucking is electric.","[removed]","That's bs. Why should trucks haul heavy batteries everywhere. Every kg/lb matters.It's gonna be LNG, better diesel engines and electric power lines like trains have now. Every energy systems has a place somewhere.","[removed]","not until they solve the issues with charging when it's cold and the reduce mileage when it's cold.","This is just wrong. California who is leading the charge nationwide for electric trucks has said they cannot increase the gross vehicle weight limit beyond 82,000lbs or it would make thousands of bridges off-limits, essentially stopping truck cargo from moving. Frito lay and Pepsi are light cargos. Chips and non-dense sodas are some of the lightest use-cases in the industry which is why they were chosen for pilot programs.Most food and commodities are very heavy, pushing the maximum allowable gross weight in every single load. A battery electric or hydrogen truck weighs an average of 8-10,000lbs more than a conventional diesel. This makes effective cargo weights be lowered by 25%, which means more trucks on the road, more expensive for basic food and commodities, and more strain on a power grid that already cannot support California‚Äôs needs.Even if someone wanted to convert right now to electric trucks, major players like PGE are giving 5+ year build outs for private charging for trucking, and as more demand comes in that will get worse. For small companies that own 1-5 trucks and park in third party lots they don‚Äôt own have no access to charging, and there are basically 0 public charging infrastructure being built.When the technology and charging infrastructure improves, maybe this will be a possibility, but it is far from easy and is currently no where close. California‚Äôs mandate is way too aggressive for this industry which is absolutely critical for everyone that lives in the US. Mandating these changes and making this industry vastly more inefficient and expensive will hyper charge inflation.","This seems like a fallacy unless we really make batteries Star Trek good (ie light and nearly infinite energy) since trucks have to pull huge loads long distances. It's just unrealistic to think that a truck would have to charge up when there are critical deadlines and thousands of miles sometimes to go.","What a stupid headline","And china and India will continue burning cheap hydrocarbons and the west will strip mine the earth for lithium and copper and the climate will continue to warm and nothing will change.","There is no where near enough electricity to do this, even it were a good idea.","Every semi needs 2.5-3 MW-hrs per day of operation. Even if we ignore the fact that the largest batteries out there are only pushing 1 and that a 3 MW-hr battery would weigh 40-50,000 lbs, where exactly will the power come from to charge them?","[removed]","[removed]","I don't know if this is still relevant.

The trucks could run without the extra weight and we should expand train cargo routes to handle more to more places.","Electric cars are the biggest hoaxes with current technology. The maintenance is extremely high and most of them will be abandoned after 5 years.","Oooor just move to electrified rail. We already know how to do this and would require very little new innovation.","Lol, this article is horseshit.Heavy trucking industry wants hydrogen instead, because if you have a semi full of batteries, you're hauling batteries.Hydrogen is far lighter and it takes a fraction of the time to refuel than to recharge.And pretending you have to truck in hydrogen is hilarious when the Biden admin is tossing billions to create hydrogen hubs and pipelines. You can also add hydrogen to current natural gas pipes and extract it pure from them.This article is clownery.","This title makes no sense","Never state in absolute if you dont want to be proven wrong","So while the energy to do this is around the battery technology isn‚Äôt dense enough. Also charge time is an issue.There is a ton of energy in gasoline/diesel for pretty little weight. A battery is always full weight no matter how full. And that‚Äôs weight needs to be moved as well. Because of this a battery less electric vehicle would be a lot more efficient. That‚Äôs the main thing stopping electric freight since it is a lot better, lower maintenance, nicer to drive, ...Realistically electrified highways would be the solution to this.Edit for more context: To drive a mile a semi truck uses about about half a liter of diesel fuel this costs about 0,6‚Ç¨ This is at most 1.5 kwh that effectively being used since these motors aren‚Äôt highly efficient in turning chemical energy in movement, a lot gets lost as heat. 1.5 kwh would cost about 12 cents wholesale.This means there is a 48 cents per mile margin for companies or governments to install and run overhead power lines. With up to 400 miles per day per truck that‚Äôs a lot of room for investment, especially when it means less additional weight on roads and savings on road maintenance and healthcare and the government is likely to step in as well for initial funding."],"points":122},{"text":["GenAI tools ‚Äòcould not exist‚Äô if firms are made to pay copyright","AI for use by consumers: Strict laws and usage, forbidden words, limited innovation, illegal searches denied.AI used internally at companies: We will do what we want, just don't tell anyone.AI used by military and Governments: We wipe our arses with Disney intellectual property, nobody can't stop us because we will claim national security.","Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) company Anthropic has claimed to a US court that using copyrighted content in large language model (LLM) training data counts as ‚Äúfair use‚Äù, and that ‚Äútoday‚Äôs general-purpose AI tools simply could not exist‚Äù if AI companies had to pay licences for the material.Translation: Our entire business model - that we've received billions in funding for - is unsustainable unless we circumvent IP and copyright laws.

WoW!!!","this is old news from years ago?","Great ..but will it fold up like the rover ‚Ä¶","That‚Äôs so cool","Typically wheels have always been resistant to puncture ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the TIRES that are usually the problem.And no, NASA did not invent puncture proof tires.","We‚Äôve had wheels that never get punctured for millennia?","Bruh unpuncturable wheels have been around for a long time, what the f do u think they got on chariots in Rome, Michellin?","I‚Äôll believe it when it gets put on my car","I wonder how well these would perform at high speed. As well as how much they might damage roads.","NASA, wooden wheels want to have a word with you.","Yet we have to buy rubber tires that pollute constantly. Because some fat asshole wants to keep making money.","My forklift has these!"],"points":1907},{"text":["China‚Äôs Record Solar Additions in 2023 Top Entire U.S. Solar Capacity","Of course they are installing more. It is becoming the cheapest option by far, and they need more power. We should subsidize our production here with bonuses for improvements and decreasing cost.","Union electrician in a big market here that mostly does infrastructure (transportation) work, solar work has typically been going non union due to how much cheaper they are but from my perspective that has started to change. We picked up a lot of major solar jobs going into next year and it seems to be driven from issues the customers had with poor installation leading to fires. If the fire department shows up to a warehouse on fire and there is uninterruptible DC power, they are gonna let that thing burn to the ground. Seems it's cheaper to mitigate a fire by not selecting the lowest bidder. Both union and non shops that command a higher price with more experienced/more expensive workers now seem to be a lot more competitive when customers realize that there's a lot more solar than just plugging in an inverter.","China installed a record-high solar power capacity last year, with additions in 2023 alone topping the current capacity of the entire U.S. solar fleet.China added as much as 216.9 gigawatts (GW) of solar power capacity in 2023 ‚Äì a record high, obliterating its previous record of 87.4 GW of solar power additions 2022, according to data from the National Energy Administration cited by Bloomberg.","40% of this years GDP growth in China was accounted for by the 'clean energy' sector. That is to say, renewables, batteries, ev's etc.China is aiming to make renewables the new oil.

They have a billion people.","And to make it worse the USA is about to elect the \"anti-science\" party for another 4 years.","They also have the world record for most amount of coal fired power plants and increasing them at an unprecedented rate.But everyone wants to get lost in the ‚ÄúChina good solar the best‚ÄùStill one of the worlds largest emitter of co2 and pollution and that has absolutely no signs of slowing.","Maybe they will burn less coal","As they build more coal burning üî• power plants üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ","Coal Consumption by Country(World Share)1 China 50.5%2 India 11.3%3 United States 8.5%Global Pollution Contribution by Country1 China 30%2 United States 15%3 India 7%China also sits nearly at the top for highest air pollution. Countries like the UK and US meanwhile have air particulate concentrations 1/10th China's.Its nice that any country is investing in renewable infrastructure. China will need to increase their investment an order of magnitude greater if they plan to outpace the harm they're doing to the planet and their people however.","Good for them. Now if they'd fix their whole human rights problems I might actually respect them as a country.","Hopefully they don't end up in landfills like their ebikes.","So they installed ~2.7 times as much solar as we did but they‚Äôre ~4.5 times bigger in population than us. Sounds like they‚Äôre a bit behind in terms of proportionality of solar power. Not mention they have much more factory‚Äôs to power. This headline made it seem like they‚Äôre strides ahead of us but that‚Äôs just not true, China releases more Co2 per capita than the US, I hope we can keep up the competition though let‚Äôs get us both to net zero ahead of schedule!","How much can we trust china's numbers?I know they had a bad reputation for fudging numbers, not sure if they still do.In this case I'd imagine it's quite easy to verify with satellite imagery?","The real test is if they are still all working in 5-10 years time. If it does, kudos to them, but they kind of have a track record.","China just uses a crap-ton of energy and is the worlds largest polluter.
