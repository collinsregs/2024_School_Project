Look no further, follow the course rigorously, go for their second course on Stable Diffusion (if you want/can), implement a few small scale version of papers from arXiv, Papers With Code is a good place to find something you might be interested in, and you'll be ahead of most ML/AI professionals.","All the courses are still super relevant. What you need to learn is math, statistics, and linear algebra.But if you wanna jump straight to it you can install pytorch and learn how to use it from tutorials","It depends on what you want to do with AI. There are multiple AI fields that are fit for different use cases, so you should learn about them first and decide which fits best for you. And there are also multiple solutions that at different levels of abstraction and difficulty.You have a few options to consider. Here's a non-exhaustive list of options going from easy to difficult:Using APIs like OpenAI APIs. By far the easiest option of all.Using fully managed solutions from cloud providers like AWS or Azure that use ML under the hood but don't expose all its complexityUsing managed ML environments from cloud providers or other platforms to run existing models, e.g. models from HuggingFace and fine-tune foundational models (e.g. from cloud provider or HuggingFace)Working locally with tiny opensource models (so no cloud compute and associated skills necessary)Actually training a new model from scratch, which requires a lot more fundamental knowledge than any of the options above and a sizable budget to spend on computeI think this visual introduction to machine learning is good to build an intuition: A visual introduction to machine learning (r2d3.us)For reinforcement learning, there are additional considerations to take, but you're not going to get there so fast anyway. If you're a masochist and want to go into this right now anyway, you should also eventually learn about deep reinforcement learning, a combination of RL and DL for which OpenAI has set up a decent site: Introduction ‚Äî Spinning Up documentation (openai.com)A tip: never buy courses that teach you \"AI\". You can't teach AI holistically.

The answer is 2,941 years.In a given 100 year time frame, 96.6% of all guns in the US are never involved in harming anyone, intentionally or accidentally. I really did not expect that. I was expecting the answer to be a few years, at most.","AI Assistant in an ear piece/smart watch combo.

I've since done a lot of AI. Yes, the numerical methods for linear and non-linear solvers are very similar to the error correcting solvers used in AI. The reason for this is probably because they are both PDE solvers. When we're doing backpropagation, we're applying a PDE that relates the error of the prediction back to the input coefficients/variables.Of course there are analogues between biology and the \"neirons\" of AI--so maybe there is additional overlap there as well.I used AI at one point to find relationships or rather to be able to predict certain specific medical diagnosis based on blood sample data (sounds like bioinformatics to me).

I guess he thought most AI researchers believed they could build a more intelligent machine than God could, and had ego problems as a result. Strange. Neither of those assumptions apply to me, so I don't think they are very logical assumptions since I don't believe they are generally true.I read the book \"Future Shock\" years ago. It predicted there will be many people who can't cope with the accelerated pace of science and technology, so society will need to establish enclaves for them, like in \"The Truman Show\" or \"The Village\" (2004) so that people can live in simpler 1950s type worlds with limited contact with the outside world, which wants to move ahead.

Occam's Razor says that this is the right answer. The only way to mitigate would be to somehow start a wave of mass complains around it generating too few.
