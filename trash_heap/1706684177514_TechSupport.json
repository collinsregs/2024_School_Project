Are you asking if connection by ethernet to a device would be better than wifi? The answer is yes assuming the cable is Cat5e or above and the device has a gigabit ethernet port.","What download speeds do you get? What WiFi version do you have? Is it WiFi 6?","What is a \"wifi box\"?","Bandwidth (how much raw data can be transferred per second) is limited to the slowest connection between any two points. So say you're downloading a game from Steam, the data might go from Valve server to Valve's ISP, their ISP to your ISP, your ISP to your modem/router, your router to your PC. Let's say Valve have 1000 Mega bit per second internet, the ISPs have a 1,000,000Mbps link between them, and you have 500 Mbps 5G internet.Scenario 1: the WiFi between your router and PC only gives you 300 Mbps. Then your max bandwidth is 300 Mbps since that's the slowest link in the chain.Scenario 2: You move your PC closer to the router, and surprise, now your WiFi gives you 800Mbps! But, your internet connection is still limited to 500 Mbps internet, so that's your max bandwidth because it's the slowest link.With scenario 1, changing from WiFi to Ethernet would improve your max bandwidth. With scenario 2, it wouldn't. So while Ethernet is usually higher bandwidth than WiFi, whether that improves your maximum bandwidth depends on whether the WiFi is the bottleneck, or your internet connection (or something further up the chain, like the server you're downloading from).However, bandwidth is not the only factor determining \"connection strength\" as you called it.Packet loss is another issue. Some types of connection are more reliable than others. Ethernet uses a shielded cable to send information as electrical signals, generally speaking there isn't much data loss. WiFi sends information using radio waves, anything from walls to microwaves to the planet Earth itself can interfere with those signals. Packet loss is much higher. The more packets that get lost, the more frequently they have to be retransmitted. So even if WiFi can theoretically send a packet of data really fast, the end result - your download speed - isn't great if you have to resend packets 3, 4 or a dozen times. This accounts for the biggest difference between the \"theoretical maximum bandwidth\" of WiFi, and the actual time it takes to transfer a file of a certain size.Latency is yet another issue. Where download speed is how many data packets reach you per second, latency is how long it takes for a packet to reach you after you request it. This is another area where WiFi loses. Because radio waves are so prone to interference, there's a lot of complicated work that happens to transmit and receive them reliably. A lot of checking and double checking and confirming receipt and so on. Not to mention the work involved in physically converting electrical signals from the computer to radio waves and back again. Since 5G also uses radio waves, it has the same problem. And the other issue is, unlike bandwidth which is basically the slowest link, latency is cumulative. So if your WiFi has 12ms of latency, this is added to 20ms latency of your 5G connection, the 3ms of your ISP to Valve's ISP, and the 1ms between Valve's server and their ISP.So even if bandwidth were equal, latency can make your internet experience feel worse. But on the flip side, it also means that improving the latency of just one of the connections (realistically, the only one you have any control over is the WiFi) will improve your overall latency. So really it depends on what exactly you mean by \"connection strength\" (latency, bandwidth, or both?) and where your biggest bottlenecks are."],"points":2},{"text":["Laptop WiFi card","Intel doesn't keep track of their laptop wifi card, they're supposed to be used by OEMs which provide the support for end users https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000092302/wireless.htmlThe best bet is just to install the drivers https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/204836/intel-wifi-6e-ax210-gig/downloads.html and verify that it works."],"points":1},{"text":["One of my monitors isn’t displaying as good of a picture on my new PC.

But that also relies on having support infrastructure on the cloud side, which will be costly.rsync also can compress data for transit (-z option), I couldn't find any evidence that Dropbox does but I'd be surprised if it didn't, the API docs should indicate whether it does or not.Whether either of those solutions are of any benefit highly depends on the structure of the data in your specific file. Either of the above might work great if it's eg. a text file, and you basically only append lines or modify the occasional existing line. But for example a database file (eg. from a SQLite DB), an encrypted file, a zipped file, or really any binary file; those algorithms may not necessarily work effectively.If your focus is on efficiency of data synchronization, you should probably implement your own process/API that can understand the context of the data and synchronize it with maximum efficiency."],"points":0},{"text":["Laptop randomly freezes randomly"],"points":0},{"text":["Weird problem probably hardware"],"points":0},{"text":["Merge Two 2.4Ghz USB A Adapters into One USB A Male Connector","Why would you tear down two perfectly working dongles just to avoid buying the hub?

But that doesn't block them, it just removes the knowledge they could use to call/message, and the knowledge that could be used to call them/message them. If that knowledge is later shared, then it's back to the start again.Alternatively, some service providers can block numbers from their end, so that nothing you could do on the phone could unblock them. But that depends entirely on phone provider if they offer that service or not. To unblock it would require the service provider's app/website or to call their customer service etc. So a little harder than unblocking using basic stuff.Realistically, if the user wants to contact someone who they have blocked, they can just use another channel. Like a messaging app or alternative sim card/phone number or social media. So if your problem is the user is unblocking the number, then the human problem is ultimately what needs addressing.If you are the account holder and owner of the device (in the case of a child's device), I'd guess there would be a way of getting the service provider to block a number. And the child wouldn't have access to the credentials to log in/call to undo the block.Again, this won't stop them using Discord or, WhatsApp or whatever.So acting as a 3rd party and blocking someone from contacting someone else without that person's consent is not really a realistic option, afaik."],"points":2},{"text":["I installed linux and want to go back","Making changes to your system BIOS settings or disk setup can cause you to lose data.

This is a bug in their hotkey configuration.The only fix I've found is to just disable HKKbdFltr from being used (It's the driver that is actually at fault). If you want to do this, go into the registry and navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Control\\. Right click on the Class folder and select Export so that you have a backup. Now expand the Class folder, click on Class and do Ctrl+F to search because this string is annoying to find manually. Search for \"4d36e96b-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318\" and it should move to this folder and it should look like this (Ignore the non-english parts).The Data field of the UpperFilters registry should look like this on your machine: \"HKKbdFltr kbdclass\". If it does, right click on it, select Modify and remove \"HKKbdFltr\" so that it just says kbdclass. Restart the PC and see if you still crash."],"points":0}]
