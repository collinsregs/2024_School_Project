It keeps the encryption and leaves the keys behind, but the drive’s encryption and (likely in your case) TPM demands are probably still the same. In other words it wont protect you from setup issues since the encrypted structure is still the same. If you’re worried about bitlocker nonsense causing a problem you should always fully remove the encryption first.By the way you really shouldn’t use TPM bitlocker on a computer that you’ll frequently change the hardware on. The TPM will frequently panic and demand the recovery key. Setting Bitlocker to no-TPM password-on-boot mode and enabling autologin is arguably more secure, and also won’t shit itself on hardware changes.

So if your computer can only handle 4800mHz, but you pay more money for 5600mHz, then you've paid for 800mHz your computer isn't using.Also have to make sure that you are following the rules on single or dual channel RAM.

This can be expanded outside the server, through a self-hosted VPN on the corp, so any computer anywhere can have access to the internal network after logging in to the VPN. Usually, the VPN authentication is linked to the roaming authentication, ie, two people can use the same PC at different times, just like the terminal in the facility.However, roaming user profiles are just that, profiles, it's not too different from when you're loading a cloud-saved game, the actual game processing is still done on your PC.

It's not as fast or reliable as Ethernet, but usually better than WiFi. But not every home has wiring that will work with Powerline adapters.Another option is mesh WiFi. WiFi 7 has just been released. Hardware will be super expensive, but you said you wanted the best so that's unavoidable. Depending on how far your room is from the Starlink gateway, you might need multiple mesh nodes to cover the distance. Latency will be terrible, but hey you're using Starlink so it already sucks anyway.The last option is to get multiple WiFi access points (aka WiFi extenders).

Most modems/routers won't support it, which may include the Telus Network Access Hub. That may be why the technician mentioned setting the hub into bridge mode and using a separate router, so you could use a router that supports multiple WAN addresses; or to plug multiple routers into the switch, each of which will obtain their own public IP address (you would give Telus the MAC address of each router to allocate a different public IP to).But if you want just one static IP, it would be assigned to the MAC address of the Telus hub, which you would use as the gateway router (ie. not in bridge mode) with no other routers on the network. Whether Telus requires any configuration on the hub to set the static IP, or they can do it all from their end, is up to their support team to guide you.

Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns.","Computer security is like an ogre; it has layers.Forwarding a port is peeling away one of those layers.Generally, port forwarding itself isn't that risky. It's what service you have running that's listening to that port that presents a risk. If nothing is listening, nothing can happen, other than maybe a little probing. If an insecure software is running, any vulnerabilities it has can potentially be exploited. Do you trust Minecraft to not have any security flaws? I wouldn't. Especially if you haven't taken any steps to prevent unwanted users joining your server. That's not really \"hacking\", that's just someone probing for public open Minecraft servers and stumbling across yours.Now the possibility of getting hacked and actually getting hacked are two different things. Some files increasing in size aren't particularly indicative of anything. They could be game files that grew after a game update. Or world save files that grew after you played the game and did stuff within the world. Or some kind of cache files that are only created after play. Impossible to say since you haven't specified exactly which files were bigger.If you value your cyber security and have the means, a personal VPN like ZeroTier is certainly good protection - adding layers of security to compensate for the ones you've removed. Otherwise, if you trust in the security of Minecraft like thousands of other people do every day, and just want to stop other people logging into your server, there are simpler ways to do that.","As risky as the app that's listening on that port. With ZeroTier, unless you also forward it on your router, no one else on the internet can even access it.","Why not just whitelist the server? There are all kinds of tools that scan for open/public Minecraft servers.","It depends on what you are forwarding to.
