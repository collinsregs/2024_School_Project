And then realize the pizza image is there. And think.... ü§î","A benign image of a pizza was uploaded to a third-party website and was then linked with a URL pasted into the ‚Äúabout‚Äù page of a registered Ars user. Buried in that URL was a string of characters that appeared to be random‚Äîbut were actually a payload. The campaign also targeted the video-sharing site Vimeo, where a benign video was uploaded and a malicious string was included in the video description. The string was generated using a technique known as Base 64 encoding. Base 64 converts text into a printable ASCII string format to represent binary data. Devices already infected with the first-stage malware used in the campaign automatically retrieved these strings and installed the second stage.The image posted on Ars appeared in the about profile of a user who created an account on November 23. An Ars representative said the photo, showing a pizza and captioned ‚ÄúI love pizza,‚Äù was removed by Ars staff on December 16 after being tipped off by email from an unknown party. The Ars profile used an embedded URL that pointed to the image, which was automatically populated into the about page. The malicious base 64 encoding appeared immediately following the legitimate part of the URL. The string didn‚Äôt generate any errors or prevent the page from loading.Opening the same file in a hex editor‚Äîa tool for analyzing and forensically investigating binary files‚Äîshowed that a combination of tabs, spaces, and new lines were arranged in a way that encoded executable code. Like the technique involving Ars and Vimeo, the use of such a file is something the Mandiant researchers had never seen before. Previously, UNC4990 used GitHub and GitLab.The initial stage of the malware was transmitted by infected USB drives. The drives installed a payload Mandiant has dubbed explorerps1. Infected devices then automatically reached out to either the malicious text file or else to the URL posted on Ars or the video posted to Vimeo. The base 64 strings in the image URL or video description, in turn, caused the malware to contact a site hosting the second stage. The second stage of the malware, tracked as Emptyspace, continuously polled a command-and-control server that, when instructed, would download and execute a third stage.","I don‚Äôt understand what the big deal is. How is this any different from putting the base64-encoded binary on the about page itself as text? Or embedding the string in the image data itself? What‚Äôs special about putting it in an unused URL field?","Jesus.","This is not a unique attack. Stuff similar to this has been working for years.

That simple.","Why you're seeing layoffs?Quite a few things out of your control if you're trying to get into an internal company. First, we just finished CY23 and are now into CY24. Those who have their FY fall on the Calendar year and finishing up their books and most likely are making changes that adjust for the 10% revenue increase that most publicly traded companies will be predicted to hit. At this point, they are shoring up revenue for cost centers and revenue generators.The other is if the company's FY falls in line with tax season, it is probably in Q4. So they are in the opposite, where they are scrambling to figure out what can be cut in order to balance the books to either have a solid earning call, or if it is underperforming, lighten the blow.At the end of the day, the Officers, C-Suite, and Board of a company ultimately make their generational wealth off the stocks they own in the company...not their salariesI put that there because everyone needs to remember it. Even if you're in privately held practices, someone holds the reigns to the wallet and is expecting to increase their cash flow based on their investment. So changes will come down hard.Why is it hard to land interviews?As stated in the above, you now have a candidate pool that has Academic Graduates + Transitioning Employees with experience X Cybersecurity Employees with Experience.With the market getting tighter, as evident with layoffs alone, that dwindles many echelon technical positions. So what was once a Principal before Jim left is now a Senior when the req is posted. The candidate pool is now over saturated with at least 2 sets of people in the equation above who are looking to fill the role. Another distinct level of graduates will attempt it. Talent and acquisition will use AI and the other scanning mechanics to dwindle the list to 10-15. Those 10-15 go to Hiring Manager who then select the 5-8. That gets dwindled to the 3-5 that will start the interview process. That will go down to 1-2. And from there the offer based on the interview scores and hiring manager approval.When Will It End?We are in a field that has high attrition due to burn out, poor work/life balance, and just overall mental health struggles. I personally believe many of these companies have no intention in filling any of these roles at the present time. They are posting Ghost Positions in the hopes of compiling a pool of candidates for if they get headcount, or someone leaves the company and it impacts work production.Again, everything that happens in a company is dictated by the market. C-Suite and Board have the responsibilities to their shareholders, of which most of them make up the overwhelming majority of the held stock. Not many C-Suites come with a cybersecurity background. Heck the degree didn't even exist until very recently when you look at how long formal academics have been around. That means their ultimate question every year at the end of the year is: \"Did we get breached? No? Then why do you more headcount or revenue for products that we already have?\" Is that overgeneralized? Probably a little. But I've sat on calls where CFO's post-breach were all about EDR and MDR solutions, until Year 3 when the question was \"Well...what are we really getting out of this? Nothing has happened since.\"Don't be shocked when you're hearing murmurs from your peers in the industry saying that their company is remaining flat this year. If anything, you'll see attrition through being pushed out vs. them quitting to free up cash flow as they try to keep the stronger personnel. Which will have a dual negative effect (it always does) because now the stronger personnel are working even harder and then burnout kicks in and they leave.From that point...look at the above paragraphs about why you're seeing layoffs and why it is hard to get an interview. Thus, the cycle.","Slow isn‚Äôt even the word. It is all messed up. Most of IT needs help with more staff, especially cyber, but companies no longer want to on the job train people. If this trend continues, companies in the US will be in big trouble as the veterans age out and there are not enough young people with knowledge to replace them. It will be funny since there will be theories as to why this happened and I am sure none will be true. Companies are trying to cut corners and still don‚Äôt understand that IT is not a Cost Center.

While trades will be too difficult for those sedentary individuals to start in their 40s.Trust me, fuck CS and go learn a trade.","Interesting thread","no jobs, AI tools doing everything soon. no human needed, its all a lie! everyone will be removed soon!","It is a very complex problem. More candidates will make it harder to get entry level jobs. Moreover, it did nothing about helping develop that talent. Furthermore, it doesn‚Äôt solve the issue of companies wanting to hire extremely skilled people for mid level jobs, without providing pathways to get there","Budget tightening will likely continue through at least the rest of the year. I finally got the green light to open some offensive AppSec roles for my team, but my approved budget for them was half of my proposal. This essentially forces them to be offshore rather then domestic, which only adds to the drying up of the market.","It's cause cybersecurity is the new wave for bootcamps, colleges and people looking to get into tech. Many people don't do extended research and get sold the dream of a six-figure job right out of college or said bootcamps. Same thing happened with mechanical engineering in the late 2000s/early 2010s. Same thing happened/is happening with computer science right now, where people are looking to get into software engineering, and now it's cybersecurity.Most of the certifications that the industry relies on like Security+ aren't enough to gauge candidates of their true ability. People graduate with zero internships in IT or extracurricular experiences and all have similar degrees and certifications. At that point, it's hard for companies to filter through the pile I imagine.","It's difficult to predict how long the current slump in employment will last, as various factors can influence the job market. However, considering the cyclical nature of the economy and the fact that many tech companies are experiencing slow growth or even layoffs, it's possible that the hiring situation may improve over time. It's essential to stay informed, network with professionals in the field, and be prepared to adapt to changes in the job market","The peak that you saw years ago has never been the norm. Feels like we are back to just below normal numbers IMOSaw this years ago with becoming a server admin then network admin then cloud admin. You ride the wave when it‚Äôs hot but must understand it won‚Äôt last","It's true that hiring in cybersecurity and tech roles has been sluggish for quite some time now, which is concerning. It's difficult to predict with certainty when this downturn will improve or if it's a permanent shift in the industry.On the other hand, I think there's plenty of good quality jobs to be had if you have the skills. I'm a recently laid off red teamer and I've been looking at roles that are more reverse engineering and exploit development focused. I found a bunch of them from defense contractors, which is a world I'm not familiar with. Still, the jobs exist.","All the comments is scary for me üòÖ i was getting ready to start my career path in cybersecurity. What I suppose to do? Shall i stop now before i pay a lot of money for courses?","as someone who‚Äôs in a degree path for ‚Äúcybersecurity‚Äù seeing these posts always depresses me. i feel like I have no fucking chance even if I do get certs or IT experience","Who do you know in the industry that is in a hiring position? Or have you been networking in person?","That is very disheartening","cybersecurity is just IT Security.‚ÄãThe fad was always hype.","I think we're seeing the field self-correct a little bit.It's difficult to acknowledge this, because the vast majority of organizations are still sorely lacking in cybersecurity. But if you're a SOC analyst and 95% of your job is running automated tools in response to SIEM events, then someone at your company is probably looking to replace you with a script. And let's be honest, those tools are getting better every day. We don't need an in-depth full forensic analysis because Frank in accounting installed yet another \"cute cats lol also coupons\" toolbar. We just need to remediate.On top of that, there seems to be a glut of qualified candidates.The people who are decompiling malware are fine. The people who are managing compliance are fine. The people who are doing advanced endpoint management are fine. But a lot of the entry-level jobs are vanishing or shifting. It's kind of like the difference between being a sysadmin in 1994 and a sysadmin in 2024, only compressed down to 1/6th the scale.If you pull back and look at the bigger picture, I think we're seeing the beginning of the end of the IT era. A company doesn't need to have in-house sysadmins, network engineers, and cybersecurity analysts when they can just hand everything off to AWS or Azure or Oracle or a local MSP or whoever. And honestly, doing so these days makes a lot more sense than it did just ten years ago. IT is right about where US factory workers were in the 1960s. The industry is going to be okay for a while, but we're going to see some serious shrinkage over the next 20-30 years. And that includes Cybersecurity.There's still time to make a career out of it, but the door is beginning to close. And the gravy train already left the station. Coasting isn't a viable strategy anymore; people who want to build their career here are going to have to keep learning or immediately sink.",""],"points":1013},{"text":["What questions should I expect from a 2 hour long interview for a junior information security analyst?","The only thing you can do is not to work yourself into a worry. I know it‚Äôs easier said than done but there is not much you can do.2 hours does seem long but it could just be for the hiring manager to afford enough time to it so to not not feel rushed into activities afterwards and so maybe the full 2 hours won‚Äôt be needed.But for a jr role it‚Äôs not likely going to be super technical and likely only be some time towards it, but more behavioural in which case you are just talking and asking questions and they‚Äôre just gauging if you‚Äôre a good fit. Just be sure that you yourself ask questions during your interview, it‚Äôs important that you engage with them.Also it‚Äôs okay not to know an answer to a question, what‚Äôs important is how you approach it. Applicants always worry to much on this aspect and it is absolutely okay to not know every question being thrown your way, what is more important is how you conduct yourself and how you respond in this situation.But if you worry now about the interview your anxiety will show and your confidence and ability to prove your candidacy will degrade.","what is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow?.. make sure you can answer that one, just in case.The rest...there is no way to tell. Like u/Sivyre said, do your best to relax.","Have questions for them.Relax and show them what you know and don't BS them or make up answers.Remember you are trading your time and dreams for money.Also... Everyone interviewing you shits. They may know more than you but no one knows how to be immortal. They are affected by life too so be human like them.","Being a senior, I have sat for a number of junior interviews. How our interviews go. We start by describing ourselves and then the position. We ask about 10 lightly technical questions. If you answer any of them really well, we may ask a few follow up questions to probe your knowledge a bit. At the end we ask if you have any questions. (Always have a least 2-3 questions for us) It shows your interest in the position and the company. This usually takes an hour, but can go over a bit.You don't have to get every question right, or answer it right away. Step back and breath. I've seen dozens of people mess up simple questions because they are nervous and answer too quick to just to finish what's in front of them. If you don't quite understand the question, ask them to elaborate. Use association and examples from personal experience to talk though a question.When I'm doing hiring, I'm not looking for the one to get every answer right. I'm looking for a team member who will fit in with the group. Nearly everyone is nervous at an interview. Show me how you can relax and build a rapport with us in your two hours.Oh, and I always appreciate a thank you email after the interview. Gives you a chance to answer any questions you feel you missed and show that you are interested.","Is this for SI?","It's not unusual to talk to multiple groups of people in an interview, which can really add to time - it seems unlikely one group of people will be grilling you for 90 minutes, that'd be very unusual. Probably more likely you'll have 3 groups, with 30 minutes allocated for each of them.Failing questions happens, it matters but it's seldom a \"get one question wrong and you're out\" scenario. People want to judge your manner and your knowledge, and there's more ways to pass than to be perfect. Know enough to be reasonable for your skill level and the position, be someone who seems pleasant enough to work with, and you can do just fine.","Don't stress about the time. It probably will be mostly behavioral but some technical.If you don't know an answer be honest about it. Don't just shit out a guess and pretend you know it. Try something like \"I'm not sure, from what I know about ___ I would probably think that the answer is ___ but I don't know. I'll have to look this up and learn more about it\".The thing you should be most concerned about is showing you would be a good person to work with. You want them to walk away with the impression that they would enjoy spending a significant amount of time with you, be friendly, make jokes. Don't suck up though, that is really obvious.Also, teams want juniors that are willing to learn and want to learn. If you point out things you have done on your own time to learn they will eat that up.","Do it. Take notes.
