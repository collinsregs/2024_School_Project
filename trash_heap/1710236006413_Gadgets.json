[{"text":["Airbnb bans the use of indoor security cameras","Next, hopefully ban the $500 'cleaning fee'","I switched back to hotels long ago. There was a golden age of AirBNB.....and it was lovely. But that time has passed.I can stay in a hotel in most cases.....and I prefer a hotel like Embassy Suites.... get decent space, good service, great location, and not have to worry about stupid fucking disproportionate cleaning fees.....after they have already asked you to sweep, take the trash out, and put linens in the wash.","That will definitely stop cameras from being used.","The fact that this wasn't already banned is disgusting.¬†Stolen from¬†aflyingsquanch from this article on r/news","How do they enforce this? Last I checked they don‚Äôt inspect properties‚Ä¶","They weren't already??","These are the exact problems that arise whenever you let VC-backed 'disruptor' companies wedge their way into a market capture position by repackaging existing solutions in a convenient way that skirts existing regulations. And the dumb dumbs of society fall for it everytime because people are willing to give up a lot of things just for a little bit of convenience and flash.Awful company along with Uber.","Finally!I remember seeing people defending the usage of them and I was just creeped out. I've also seen people defending the usage of cameras in long term rentals and am like, \"Uh no.\"","Airbnb sucks anyway. I was duped at one in Vermont. This place was marketed as this zen isolated getaway glamping site on a farm‚Ä¶ it was not even 15ft off a well traveled public road on a CURVE. There was a privacy ‚Äúfence‚Äù (which were just tarps), and headlights would still light up the entire campsite. One drunk driver could easily take out the whole fucking site too. Talk about ‚Äúrelaxing‚Äù üôÑAirbnb wouldn‚Äôt refund for false advertising either. There was no indication anywhere that it was so close to the road. The host used her disabilities as an excuse (I don‚Äôt care) and fought until the end to keep my money even thought we left 10-15 min after we arrived after an 8 hour drive.Eventually, Airbnb did refund me as I was a thorn in their side until they did so. I had already begun the credit card cancel payment process though, so they knew they weren‚Äôt keeping it anyway and then just tried to save face.They wouldn‚Äôt let me leave a review though because we technically ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt stay‚Äù there. They 100% sided with the false advertising POS host.Fuck Airbnb. Hotels and lodges all the way.","Sure, how will they enforce that?, plus the hidden cameras.You will be recorded in many places like that.","Next ban the use of Airbnb","The last time I used airbnb I was very nearly assaulted & kidnapped by the Russian mafia running a weird bait & switch scam in SF. ¬†The cameras were the least sketchy thing about them.","Ban the sudden cancellations and readvertising when they realise there‚Äôs an event in town.","Airbnb cancelled my account for a ‚Äúparty risk‚Äù and tried to fuck me out of over $1k when I tried to book a place for family flying in from out of the state for my birthday. Fuck that company.","Fucking good.","lol! It took that long?!?!","Hotels are great. Why people still use airbnb","This wasn't a thing before? Glad I never used AirBNB","Only just now? Yikes","If their history with skirting the law in New York and other cities is any guide, they've probably just been saying its an obligation of the person operating the illegal hotel to comply with all local regulations, and doing their best to avoid any sort of liability.","Fucking finally. The place I stayed in had two in the kitchen/ sitting room, one looking down the stairs and upstairs area, another looking down the hallway leading to exit door. It was like a fucking prison. She even wanted to have another in the sink so it could look up your nose incase you didn't do the dishes.","This won‚Äôt stop. If anything it will increase the frequency of customers finding more and more","On the airbnb sub I had some heated conversations about these cameras. A lot of airbnb host feel as long as they‚Äôre in community areas (kitchen, living room) they are fine. They even tried to compare them to hotels having security cameras in their lobbies.","About fucking time. Creepy.","ban airbnb","Air BNB is effin dumb. Never in a million years would I want to stay at some randos house.I'm too of that. The house market gets fucked over because rich assholes buy these houses JUST to use as airbnbs. I hate whoever invented that shit and made it mainstream.","You mean they were allowed up to now???Holy fuck. üòÇ","This should have happened a long time ago. It‚Äôs the sole reason I stopped using them. That and the ridiculous cleaning fees","This is dumb. The cameras people should be worried about are the ones that the listing wouldn't disclose to begin with and that Airbnb doesn't know about.","I‚Äôm fucking sorry, was this not already banned?!?","Keeping cameras in any form of temporary living space is a violation of privacy. It is the equivalent of a peeping Tom. Personal affairs, business affairs, would all be recorded and kept on record by a third party that otherwise has no business/right being privy to a myriad of private correspondence that could occur during boarding. A legal matter, a business deal, etc.","This presents a fantastic unethical life pro tip.Bring a webcam with you and do your stay. Then set it up on the last day and \"accidentally find it\", snap a photo and then complain to Airbnb.Get full refund.Tell the people that they're cleaning fee was fucked and that's karma.","Oh kinda like how guns are banned in gun free zones","While I agree there‚Äôs privacy concerns, the camera movement started because of people trashing airbnbs. I think if many units start getting trashed it will lead to less properties available because people will just decide to rent them conveniently.","Spoilsports","Man the Airbnb hate is so massive. I only use Airbnb and I have never felt like I was over charged or taken advantage of in any way. They‚Äôre always cheaper than any hotel I can find nearby and I get much more space and bang for the buck.
