If you want the next Elder Scrolls or Fallout to use weird, unnatural, generated text like this instead, it might actually be an upgrade.But I think all this is going to do is make your game feel emptier. If you implement it properly, it should reflect on altering the NPC's stats, goals, etc. So that either becomes a major gameplay aspect...

The origins of Covid-19 comes to mind. Scientists involved in the research claimed \"An accusation that nCoV-2019 might have been engineered and released into the environment by humans (accidental or intentional) would need to be supported by strong data, beyond reasonable doubt.\"But that is not the correct standard. No cause currently can reach that standard. Rather, the standard is \"preponderance of the evidence\".So, lets look at the circumstantial evidence regarding accidental lab leak. We have the world's largest coronavirus lab that, as a usual and ordinary activity, created novel coronaviruses regularly. This lab contained a \"serial passage\" process that utilizes human tissues to amplify the contagiousness of viruses in humans. We have the coronavirus itself, which was novel and possessed an extreme contagiousness in humans.We have dishonesty. The Chinese refused to release information on the experiments going on in that lab that would have implicated or exonerated their experiments as a cause, and we're permitted to draw an inference from that. We have an American researcher who spearheaded a paper claiming that any claim of lab leak was conspiracy theory, without disclosing that he was involved in creating novel coronaviruses at that Wuhan lab.What is the circumstantial evidence supporting natural emergence? I'll tell you what they have - Jack Shit. They have interesting ideas that constitute \"reasonable hypothesis\", but legally, reasonable hypothesis defeats a \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard. It doesn't defeat preponderance of the evidence. Preponderance is simply adding up the circumstantial evidence, and that tally indicates lab leak as most likely.The government intervened to interfere with the discussion on the origins of C19 because, as the Supreme Court noted, \"an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will prevail\" would lead to some inconvenient truths, some of which I'll list here.All of the deaths in the US would be negligent homicides or higher since the deaths were due to the hand of another.All of us have been involuntarily made part of a medical experiment in violation of our human rights.There has been the imposition of torture, ranging from mild discomfort to being placed on a ventilator, in violation of our human rights.There has been the denial of informed consent in medical decisions, because the failure to mention that the virus was more likely than not man-made is a material omission.This concern about \"disinformation\" is masking a concern with \"inconvenient truths\". Tally up the circumstantial evidence. I see it as clearly indicating lab leak, and natural emergence isn't close. This idea that the chances of natural emergence is equal to lab leak is itself, disinformation.","Fletcher noted that the context was \"a time when thousands of Americans were still dying every week, and there was a hope that getting everyone vaccinated could stop the pandemic. And there was a concern that Americans were getting their news about the vaccine from these platforms, and the platforms were promoting - not just posting, but promoting - bad information.\"\"I know the objectives were good,\" Alito responded, but said he doubted the federal government treated print media the same way.Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested such interactions might not be unusual. There are \"press people throughout the federal government who regularly call up the media and berate them,\" Kavanaugh said.","US Supreme Court seems wary of allowing Democrats to curb social media platforms, but will of course say \"not a precedent!\" so it will seem perfectly normal when they want to allow a Republican government to do so.Easy to see through their game, it is the only game they play.
