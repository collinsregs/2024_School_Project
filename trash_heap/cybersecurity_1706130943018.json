This heavily restricts lateral movement. Its free and easy to setup.Security Awareness Training - Try to find a solution to do quarterly training for employees regarding phishing, business email compromise and safe internet usage.Vulnerability Management - Scan your environment with a vuln scanner to identify vulns. Ensure the IT teams are patching systems with regularly released monthly patches, and emergency patching for any 0 days/critical vulnerabilities that are in scope for your environment (which you will know once you start tracking assets).Password policies - Ensure your company is using appropriate password policies and that they are enforced.Secure Email Gateway - Ensure all email that comes into your environment is being scanned for malware or phishing and that it is capable of blocking/pulling emails that are malicious.Yes, you will eventually need policies, risk assessments, business impact analysis and BCP, disaster recovery, but that level of maturity takes top down buy in and leadership.

Snapchat has never even as much as suggested how they actually do that. They don't provide any way for a user to verify any sort of identity number so they could intercept everything with a trivial man in the middle attack.So that makes for an easy answer. Snapchat is not end to end encrypted in any way that matters.","Because the intelligence agencies are plugged into the tech giants.","I'm going to put this out there as a separate comment. This has been posted a few times (if not here, then must've been other subs) and after thinking about it some more, it seems like there's an obvious fix. One or more of the following must be true:The Snapchat message in question was not encrypted, either due to a failure of the app / infrastructure or design.The Snapchat message in question was indeed encrypted, but the encryption was intercepted by a sanctioned AITM attack (such as HTTPS inspection). I initially thought this was unlikely, since it would require installing a certificate on the device. That's how it works in my employer; every issued device has our certs preloaded so inspection is nearly transparent to the end user. HOWEVER, it would be very easy for Snapchat to accept other certificates, either by ignoring certificate mismatch errors or by trusting multiple certificates. It seems unlikely that Snapchat would be able to trust literally every HTTPS inspection source out there, but it's plausible that they could install a number of certificates to cover major points of presence like major international airports, select government agencies, \"trusted\" network partners, and so on.Snapchat monitors messages for certain key words or phrases. Even if the communication was truly E2EE, the app still has access to the messages by necessity.Software on the device capture the message out of band, such as by clandestine screen captures. In other words, perhaps the user had malware on their device.We aren't getting all the details, or the details we have are wrong.Regarding option #2, it would be entirely technically possible for Snapchat to say \"JFK airport is running a Checkpoint HTTPS inspection appliance on their public wifi, and we're going to trust their replacement certificate. They'll send us regular replacement certificates as they expire\". This is trivial. The only difference from a conventional HTTPS inspection setup is that the certs are trusted at the application level rather than the OS.","End-to-end encrypted means just that.It doesn't mean that the service provider doesn't store or can't recover your keys.","Makes you wonder what all airports are able to look at. Seems like the person was on the airports WiFi and it was able to pickup keywords like “taliban” and “bomb” and flag it. Since Snapchat works as a messaging app there’s probably a way to pick up keywords from only messages and text. I guess people assume that since the images can’t really be looked at as easily that the text within them also can’t.I also wouldn’t rule out that someone within this persons friend group just reported it and in my opinion that’s what the news should’ve reported it as.","I thought it was common knowledge by now that snapchat doesn’t hesitate to dump user messages and photos to police when asked.

When you have folks who are genuinely good at what they do, it's understandable that they'd want to try and market those skillsets for more than what they'd get on someone else's dime.I may have misread your post, but you're going to be in a bad way if you both try to remain employed for an employer AND are actively looking to steal business away from that employer for your own independent contracts. That's a definite conflict of interest (and could potentially land you in legal trouble if you're leveraging proprietary NDA insights of your employer in the pursuit of said contracts).By contrast, it would be appropriate to reach out to clients you've worked with to bid on working with them after you've left your employer. They know you and you know them; assuming they want to stick with you, then that's just a business decision on their part.There's a whole host of business logistics that's getting glossed over and hand-waived in this post that's worth looking into. How are you looking to structure your business for tax purposes? How many employees are you going to take on? What provider are you going to go with for their benefits (i.e. medical, dental, etc.)? What are your operating costs? How familiar are you with assorted state/federal laws/regulations (e.g. PCI, HIPAA, etc.) which will apply to your various clients and how you perform your work? What overhead/architecture do you need to setup to be lawfully compliant yourself? Do you know how long (and what type) of data you're legally required to retain? Do you know how to properly store/dispose of it? So on and so forth. These and other questions involve a non-trivial amount of work that separate \"safe bet\" companies apart from eager kids with Metasploit and a bank account; that they are considered and accounted for will go a long way in both attracting clients and retaining them.There is a lot of competition in this space, so you're going to need some way of distinguishing your business apart from others. Some upsell penetration tests atop other typical MSP-like functions; some utilize crowdsourced talent (e.g. Synack) to reduce costs; some rely on personal relationships with smaller, localized businesses. You have an idea at the moment, but you haven't identified a competitive edge.Importantly, a non-trivial amount of your time will be spent on business administration (vs. performing penetration tests) when you own a small business; some of that responsibility was alluded to in the questions in the earlier bullet, but it needs to be emphasized. A disproportionate amount of your time will be in service to figuring out where your next contract is going to come from, how to manage/secure sales, etc. Since most penetration testing engagements are very brief (a few days to maybe a week or two) and that of those, most clients only need one performed annually (sometimes biannually, if at all), you can start to see that you're quickly going to need to on the look for additional clients (and that's assuming that your old clients return to contract you again).Best of luck!"],"points":1},{"text":["I want the truth about the CyberSec space in Switzerland!","Switzerland is not in the EU.

There are exceptions, but most are under funding significantly and asking teams to do with what they have.It should be no surprise that companies who have decided it is cost effective to minimize spend are the most likely to experience breach events.Source: am consultant","It’s a cat and mouse game","These companies are outsourcing security and laying off security analysts. They are asking for it.","I think a part of the disconnect sits between doing things securely and doing business. Or the perceived barrier at least. Another problem is often the scale of things. We have so many servers, endpoints and many other things with connectivity, they cant keep up with everything. And unfortunately still a huge lack of awareness from both system developers and people running the show. The only certainty i can tell you is that it will not go away anytime soon","I had a vendor providing us with a e-commerce site fall to a terrorist linked group because they had the most basic setup and really no security in place on top of not backing up things correctlyTheir whole product was lost except for a lone backup on a USB key.All the money in the world and they didn’t do the right thing. FAFO for sureCompanies still don’t take security seriously and still let the users dictate what they do.","There are multiple issues that come into play, but I think these 3 would solve MANY issues. 1) It’s very HARD to break into the industry or change jobs. This is because the requirements are sky high and yet nobody wants to take a chance on hiring someone who doesn’t meet a laundry list of requirements. Yet those people who do are working at larger companies or as CISOs, not middle managers. Give people chances! Therefore, companies will spend more to get that shiny new tool rather than people. 2) There are sooo many certifications. Yes there are many different areas but it feels like it’s going to be every org like ISC2 and CompTia offering basically the same career progression of certifications (Sec+ to CASP+ vs CC to CISSP). Not sustainable and not healthy for the industry as people don’t know what to get and often have to navigate for their job and such. It seems like a money and time suck, rather than focusing on securing the systems in some instances.3) Cyber often thought of as a loss leader for companies unless they sell cyber, must do it for compliance, or have been hacked/leaders who are aware of reputations damage. If cyber were thought of as a feature or not as much of a loss leader, then things might be more secure.","My .02...people, processes, and technology. Companys buy all this tech (which I generally think is good overall) but they've forgotten fundamentals/basics. EDR solutions are no good if you allow local admin and have no application control. Secure build configurations/standards are clearly not a thing based on how easy some of these breaches happen. And people are TOO tool dependent. Etc. Etc.In Security, my experience has been \"If we buy X tool it will cover up our mistakes\" but it never does. Companys need to slow down (laughs) and go back to basics because a LOT of these vulns/exploits/issues the industry has figured out. We (collectively) need to teach our employees, establish processes, and document what we are doing.The fact that I work with a 20-year 'sys admin' who doesn't know he 'had to patch' or a SOC analyst of 6 years who can't cd to a directory on their Mac is shameful.The good thing about the SEC filings against SolarWinds is that MAYBE companies who are negligent will start to get worried and will take things more seriously. These data leaks are 100% preventable","Someone please help me understand!You have a box where you click on things. the box is made poorly so sometimes you click on something bad and it blows up the entire world. until the box is made so well that clicking on a bad thing does NOT blow up the world, this status quo will continue.Putting up a sign saying \"do not to click on the bad things\", making it harder to click on anything at all, having another box or a person look at the thing before clicking, jailing people that make the blow-up bad things, all that helps but does not fix the root cause that you MUST click things on a box where clicking things can lead to very bad outcomes.","It's basically a new world war of sorts. But instead of countries vs. countries, it's countries vs. companies. It's not Germany vs. France anymore. It's China vs. Macy's Department Stores. Kind-of an uneven playing field.We never expect McDonalds, Starbucks or Holiday Inn to secure our boarders, or scramble jets to defend our airspace against a Russian invasion. But we do expect the California Coast Credit Union to fend off attacks from Russia, China, North Korea, and more. And do it mostly on their own.","Some of my unpopular opinions:Companies are spending money on snake oil because they are getting told that X solution will stop things. As much as I respect CrowdStrike, their motto is literally \"We Stop Breaches.\" Are you really sure that is always the case? What happens when CS can't be deployed (Docker, Cloud, Legacy Systems) or is disabled? Or it just gives an alert and not a block? At that point its on someone to respond to it.We have done an awful job at training humans to be cyber aware. For example, you have many folks who overly cautious when they are out in public. They know the dangers out there. Meanwhile that same person has no f'ing problem clicking on random links or downloading fake browser updates from crocheting websites. Computer Training will never be enough, but hey we have a \"month\" to celebrate cyber awareness!Risk vs. Revenue. If it isn't business related, why is it allowed on the corporate internet? Everyone has a phone to look up the dumb stuff. Why is Janice in Finance or Mark in Sales getting newsletters from their local school PTA or barstool sports? Excuses I've heard from executive management typically stems around \"creating a positive atmosphere where people feel like they aren't working!\" type stuff. And that is from CIO's, which is naturally to #4CISOs are still too new to the C-Suite world, and most still report up through a CIO/CSO to the COO and then the CEO. Change is never going to happen across the company when profits and end-user experience are the forefront of a CIO and COO's mind. Security hampers productivity in their eyes and can cause outages if the solution fails. The average revenue increase for a company is 10% annually. When times get hard, the books get opened by the bean counters on where to cut costs. Cost Centers, such as IT in general, are usually one avenue that gets put under the lens.We don't condition our SOC analyst (through the spectrum of fields) on how to actually read detections and investigate properly. They are conditioned to move quickly through the alerts so it doesn't get backlogged and the blend of more FPs over TPs begins to build a sense of comfort blanket around them. My own analogy I've had to use with leadership, \"You've conditioned every analyst to feel like they are on a patrol around a secure perimeter. Everything that even moves calls in a special investigation team of 2-3 more people. Come to find out it is just a rabbit in the bush. It happens again but now only the 1 person investigates. Then it happens again, only it wasn't a bunny. But they aren't responding the same way because they all think it is just the rabbit again.\"The real C-Suite are not held accountable. Sure a CISO or two have been indicted, but no CEO or Board has faced any level of investigative power from any authority. Keep in mind those authorities can easily kill their little circle of golden parachutes by enforcing they can no longer hold an Officer or Board position in a company. What cybersecurity is facing is literally why things like SOX were created for CFOs and CEOs to be held accountable if the books got cooked. There is nothing with any remote semblance of teeth out there to make a C-Suite feel their wellbeing is in limbo because of a security lapse. And sadly, that whole collective group knows they'll only be at a company for a handful of years before they jump to the next branch. They just need to keep their revenue and shareholders happy while they cash 7-figure checks and await the Board positions they so desperately seek.","Cybersecurity industry is thriving, it's the particular security practices different organizations use. A lot of sec professionals are reactive or just going through a checklist, and not engaging with leaders and their teams.","From my experience deploying security teams and seeing how most fortune 50s work internally: They’re spending more than enough money. It’s the execution and politics that are causing the problems.","This might be a separate issue - but moving sensitive data and applications to the cloud is increasing the risk of breaches. On prim has the advantage of requiring an attack to be more complex. For example, you'd need to get access to a workstation, pivot, escalate privileges, get into a jump box, pivot, escalate privilege's again, pwn a prod server, and then move to exfiltrate. With cloud - you can simply exploit a known vulnerability in that SaaS/IaaS/PaaS, find misconfigurations, or spear phish someone with admin privilege's then you have access to sensitive data.","Cloud will solve it","I think it boils down to cost if the data was leaked versus cost to protect the data. If the cost is to great companies often overlook it until a breach happens then do a knee jerk reaction to fix it.","[deleted]","When you tie negligence to consequences things will changeThe current regulatory environment allows for companies to fuck up and claim ignorance. Cybersecurity is considered a burden, an operational cost and C levels look at cyber in a spreadsheet checking boxes. Do I have MFA? Yes. Do I have DLP? No … etc. C levels in older companies take the easy route and buy higher cyber insurance premiums and call it a day.We need experts, not old farts legislating for cyber. Congress/Senate don’t move fast enough and don’t have the time or knowledge to understand the nuances.We need an expert state or federal agencies to make strong recommendations and push for standards and raise the stakes.Or we wait for the market forces to take their course. The monetary and repetitional cost of an attack are rising, the insurance premiums are rising cost of remediation are insane. So maybe that will change the sentiment. But I fear that many C levels are just willing to take the risk for the foreseeable future","These breaches are highlighting a huge problem that has existed for a long time: Companies that are collecting, storing, and selling every bit of information about all of their customers. This is going to continue until there's some kind of real change in data privacy laws. Of course, that isn't going to change while there's profit to be made with that data, because the money is too good. Maybe when one of these companies is ground into dust by lawsuits over their data harvesting, but probably not.","In my opinion, there are two main reasons that keep security breach happening: Zero-day vulnerabilities in the wild, and the inefficiency of cybersecurity awareness to tame enduser behavior.","What I see clients do isallocate fairly small budgetsrarely have an overall plan/roadmap/strategyhave unrealistic price expectations (senior firewall engineer with OT experience for 84 euro per hour, OT security architect for 112)Grant contracts to the lowest bidders.​What I see providers doput minimal trained staff on a contractdo just enough to satisfy contract conditionsdon't attempt to educate the client.​Net result: shoddy work, no sense of ownership","I'm more in the camp that cyber is just the tick sucking on the rabid, mangey hell-hound.Seriously. We're just a patch. Until systems are designed securely, cyber is just there to mitigate the damages you know you'll eventually incur. In other words, if you aren't part of the solution, a lot of money can be made as part of the problem.That said, I don't know if we'll ever really get there. I've seen zero change in companies willingness to secure their data. They just don't care. And honestly, when was the last time you stopped using a company because of cyber breaches?","A lot of companies aren't using tools to secure data because it's right. They're doing it to pass compliance and stay out of jail. This means the tools may be in place but lack configuration or governance. What they are participating in is called Security Theater. It's all for show.","I will say at the end of the day the problem is humans. Humans click on phishing links, humans write code with bugs. Look at the recent Ivanti 0 days, you could do everything perfect internally to prevent compromises by phishing attacks but an attacker could still get access to your network.","When I think of an industry that's broken, I think of printer companies. Cyber is more like a series of constant dumpster fires in a pit of gasoline that everyone is playing whack-a-mole to put out, but no one has found a way to prevent every possible fire and they never will.","Biggest problem I see is little to no consequences for cyber cos when a breach occurs, and then it makes the whole thing look like snake water.Ex: I know the MSSP that was supposed to be on watch when the ICBC and Ardent breaches happened (yeah same co). Literally nothing happened to them. How can you say you were doing your job that is MDR, which literally means managed DETECTION and response? It makes all of this seem like a joke on the paying customer and insurance cos.","Companies have to understand that cybersecurity is not just a technology, it's a framework. These organizations keep purchasing point solutions that they think will solve all their cybersecurity problems, but the achilles heel lies in the fragmentation of these point solutions. They've created a disjointed strategy that is easily exploited by bad actors. Cybersecurity isn't just about acquiring the latest tools; it's about fostering a culture if awareness, vigilance, and constant monitoring, and integrating security measures into every layer of your IT infrastructure. At the end of the day, all the tools in the world won't save you if you're not watching.","Considering that the overwhelming majority of data breaches was the result of a social engineering attack, we can expect more data breaches in the future.","I took a break over the new year, from multiple daily supplements to nothing, and to be honest feel similar. Im starting from scratch including diet","The industry is not broken, it's very difficult to keep users from clicking links and being gullible at our workplaces. Once we hard-wire people to naturally distrust every single email coming to them, or text or phone call, then these breaches will decrease immensely.It's a matter of societal mindset, not the tools we have in place failing us.","My guy, the biggest weakness and your biggest threat will always be users","Einstein said insanity is repeating the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. We have increased and improved our tools but so have the attackers so we are no better off. The amount of data we store is growing exponentially but the way we secure the most sensitive data hasn’t changed. We still stick it in a folder, we secure it with basically just an access control list, we don’t encrypt (encryption at rest doesn’t cut it) and we still think it’s the best thing since sliced bread and it will keep it all secured and safe.Until we change the game and move the goal posts then the result will be the same again and again.","There are actions taken by companies, and then there are employee and individual behaviors. Companies are learning the hard way that you must have a balance of Prevent & Protect tools along with Detect & Respond to completely cover your network and data. Often, they do not have both.Employees and individuals MUST have complex passwords, change them often, and have multi-factor authentication. Often, people keep their passwords easy, use them across multiple accounts, do not change them, and do not choose to run MFA.It can be like herding cats to get everyone to do what they should. It's not so much a matter of a disconnect. It's more a matter of choices and the will to do what's best. It doesn't have to be expensive. I run a prevention tool on my personal computer for about $40 a year. For Detect & Respond, I have MS Defender and LifeLock. Companies and individuals need to make better choices.This will be thrown into a startling spotlight as quantum computing evolves. Right now, data is being collected & stored. Once a quantum attack is possible, that data will all be compromised. The cybersecurity industry needs to be exploring encryption development that will block a quantum attack. That's a big piece of the direction for the future of the industry.","No. The difference between enterprise networking and security is that your networking gear isn't actively trying to break itself. In security, there are people out there with an incredible financial incentive to break company's security, which makes the challenge completely different. If a hacker spends a month and gets in to a company, they could make a great deal of money. They have all the motivation in the world to pound away and get in, so it's always going to be a cat and mouse game.","Everyone likes new tech, new features, novelty. Every new thing brings new threat surface. That’s it.I got into tech because I too love the novelty, but I work in Cyber because I know we will never get our arms around it because we want the novelty more than we want the safety. I want more novelty but if the calculus flips it means people must have stopped trusting technology… and that means I don’t get to see as many cool new things each year.","Sure as fuck feels broken, that's for sure.I'm hitting that burnout point due to upper management incompetence and blatantly ignoring recommendations.It's fucking infuriating.","It doesn't help most organizations run on legacy equipment and security was never part of their initial infrastructure design. For them, it's all bolted on which results in significant gaps and outrageous costs.","The weakest link in any InfoSec program is the user. You can have the best tech in place, if someone shares their password, you are going to get breached. There is a large focus on technical security, however, there is little emphasis on training and forcing users to implement security best practices. Everyday you will hear of people falling for basic phishing scams or leaving password unsecured.","Just because they are spending money on products, doesn't always mean they have implemented, and/or configured it correctly. In a previous position, we purchased a PAM that was never fully implemented at the server level, because the director of infrastructure would never let it happen. This is but one example. There were quite a few others, but when there is no accountability for purchasing and implementation, many things can go in half-baked. This company had been breached as well.You can preach to everyone higher up the way things need to happen, but most of those folks simply want to check a box, without ever truly implementing and configuring properly.","It's broken where I work, state agency.CISO being under CIO leads to efforts to secure being laughable and slow. Our team refuses to be the fall guy and lie, so it slows things to a crawl when we need a compliance sign off.There is more, but that's the root cause.","I've seen so many security products purchased, installed, and then never fully utilized when they realize it takes 2 new FTE's to manage one new security product. Meanwhile they a buying yet another with no labor costs baked in.At the end of the day many companies have accepted the risks vs having 20% of their profit go to security infrastructure.","Maybe we need a standard to hold people/companies to? Like a CPA/CFA, or something along the lines of the FE/PE for civ/mech/electrical engineers. A reason those exist is because the outcomes of those work products can and do affect people's lives. Bad accounting practices bring down businesses and people lose jobs. Poorly constructed buildings and infrastructure kills people. Why can this not be the same for this field? Especially when the general consensus is that this isn't a beginners field. When you have a bunch of IT people who also wear the security hat, you get bad output. This is doubly bad in the critical infrastructure sectors. Not only requiring the certification, but requiring the business to hire those with, or are in the process of getting, the right certifications, may be a step in the right direction.I'm not even sure I like this opinion, but I had to write it out lol.","Part of the problem is a lack of good practices around where they spend money. Do you buy more controls around advanced threats that you might face from nation-state backed actors or do you upgrade your MFA to get rid of SMS?It’s an issue for all companies that their spend has been increasing for a decade but they can’t really measure how successful that spend has been.","If you have more money to spend on cybersec, then you probably have more valuables to steal, leading to more and better black hats trying to exploit your system. ( my personal theory)","Lack of support from Leadership at companies in favor of short term profits. Fear. Lack of transparency. No emotional intelligence in the C-Suite.I tried being a Sec. Architect once and it was a position only meant to fail. I was never allowed to take baseline measurements on production (or dev) infrastructure in the cloud, I was told repeatedly to be a \"yes man\", and when a data exposure happened three times in a row, the exact same way, I asked about fixing the process and was met with hostility. A week later, I was dismissed from the job.At least I won't be associated with that company when they have their day in the media. It's a matter of time, but they don't seem to care.","IMHO the short answer is technical debt. The cost of refactoring applications is high from the business perspective, so you end up with incremental migrations as opposed to a large security-driven uplift.Then also consider there are lots of applications.Then consider that the devs that wrote them aren't there anymore.Then consider that breaking an app is the number one thing to avoid.An incomplete understanding usually leads to partial risk resolution if any at all. Very few enterprises have a complete understanding of their environment. Devices, users, apps, code... it's usually overwhelming for the Fortune 500.","i think a problem we understate as we look at \"the industry\" is the state of cybercrime itself.We see it all as a mainly civil matter right now because cybercrime is diffuse.So it's a question of \"was the company diligent or are they liable\" instead of \"are the layered victims of this attack (the company and the accountholders) getting justice and are attackers being stopped.The threat actors are seen almost like a weather hazard, a cost of doing business, not as individuals doing crimes.We do OK at walking things back to a point, but only to a point.","AGILEAlso, people are not doing the basics, but wanting to play about with the fancy stuff.","IT infrastructure is becoming increasingly more complex and more difficult to secure.Technical debt is becoming worse and worse in every single company.You have DevOps/Dev teams building massive infrastructure projects in their own little echo chambers, with little to no involvement with security until there is an audit with hundreds of remediation's, then security have to come in to give advice on how to secure the infra and get excuses every step of the way why things can't be fixed.You have security teams that are understaffed, under budgeted expected to protect 10s of thousands of assets.There are cybercriminal gangs which are getting bigger, more advanced and receiving support from nation states who not only turn a blind eye on their activity, but actually recruit them to assist their internal APT teams.It's like protecting the border, it's a fight we can't win, obviously if you invest enough money into security you can make it sufficiently difficult to deter 95% of attackers, but the top 5% being nation state APTs and sophisticated cybercrime/espionage groups are going to find a way in as the money is enough for them to keep trying.","I think it's a hard world out there for MSPs. One thing thought that I've seen as a HUGE flaw is focusing on compliance. Compliance doesn't equal security. EVER. But some think to seem so or focus more on that.","The only way to completely eradicate risk is to just not use anythingIf you want to eradicate all security risk when it comes to technological systems, just don't use technology","The more money companies use to extend ways in which someone can gain more access into your systems (convenience + data), the more money companies will need to spend plugging additional holes, continuing to make everything less secure."],"points":270},{"text":["Malwarebytes and their Digital Footprint Report","Have you tried https://haveibeenpwned.com/?"],"points":1},{"text":["0-click PoC to takeover all Android 10 and below by exploiting critical Bluetooth vulnerability (CVE-2023-45866)"],"points":0},{"text":["AppSec Hiring - Poland or Remote","Hello.
