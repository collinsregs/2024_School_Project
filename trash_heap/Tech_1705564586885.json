Not dirt.","This actually sounds potentially pretty useful for precision agriculture. A wireless network of soil powered moisture sensors could communicate with precision irrigation to optimise water use, for example.","Near limitless!!! fuck fusion I‚Äôm getting one of these bad boys!","I thought we were getting away from dirty power.","Now do one I can stick in my ass to keep my phone charged up.","Cool vaporware.","Prepare for the Dirt Wars of 2077","Microbial Fuel Cell. Did a research project on them. Interesting but not the most practical.","So, the team set about creating several new designs targeted at giving the cells continual access to oxygen and water...If I'm reading that right, they are taking soil that would otherwise be a carbon sink, and making it a source of GHGs. Of course it may produce fewer GHGs per watt than other electricity sources, or it may not, but I doubt it's a shame that this is unlikely to be able to be scaled up to produce electricity for the grid.","Dirt cheap?","So annoying it can‚Äôt even mention the actual amount of power it produces on acerage","Makes me think compost must be a potential powerhouse then.","Are we really that dumb?

Let me buy this landfill and tear down this waste to energy turbine and install these fuel cells.Oh no!Keeping the right environmental conditions, such as substrate availability, pH levels, and temperature, for my city powered by microbial fuel cells is taking a lot more ENERGY than I‚Äôm outputting!I know, I‚Äôll build more to offset it! Let me adjust these break even points for the shareholders while I tell them it‚Äôs better than solar.","Literally destroying earth","\"Guys, we are not destroying the planet fast enough. Is there a way to destroy it faster? Like maybe some kind of device that sucks power right out if it?\"","Yup we have aliens on earth that our technology is flying but human humanity is decreasing","Oh my god. What if this will this cause the great Dust Bowl of the 30‚Äôs?Are we going to repeat the last century?","If this can be properly scaled up then damn, this could be quite the discovery (if big oil doesn‚Äôt wipe them and their research from existence)","How long does it take? It‚Äôs kinda neat as a concept, but of course right now it‚Äôs probably not up to par to replace anything","New dirty clean energy!","Make living soil gardens everywhere and turn them into beautiful powerhouses","And so, nicoli tricks again!","ok, but what is the actual power output and stability/range of it?","MITOCHONDRIA IS THE POWERHOUSE OF THE CELL, WE CAN HARNESS IT","Remember kids: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.","Isn‚Äôt there a shortage of topsoil right now?
