They are just guessing at what to do based on what everyone else is doing.Future Headlines: \"Job Cuts Too Deep; Companies Facing Growth Challenges\" or \"How Lean Is Too Lean?\"Facebook hired thousands of people with no immediate work for them to do. I've heard stories of Facebook employees getting hired and then laid off without ever being put on an active project.","No punishment for the executives who \"overcorrected\" and \"overhired\", of course.I'm not even saying that lay-offs are inherently wrong. If these companies no longer need those employees, then it just makes sense to eliminate those jobs.But the people in charge who wasted the company's money by incorrectly foreseeing the future and overhiring in the first place don't get punished either. And that's what I have an issue with.","Being leaner also burns out employees and creates more turnover","Frankly, I don't have an issue with a company wanting to be lean and efficient.I have an issue though when they cut so many people that now teams are overwhelmed. Suddenly there's understaffing everywhere and all those people stressing out are simply told that they have to swallow it or else there's plenty of people out there willing to take their jobs for less money.I have an issue when these companies are doing it purely to please shareholders and there really isn't any other reason. Yes, I know the shareholders invested, but if we make everything always about shareholders, then these companies shouldn't be surprised that they get no loyalty and no one willing to go above and beyond for them.I also have a deep issue if any of these kinds of cuts are some kind of underhanded tactic to give more power to employers. To create artificial levels of job scarcity. So now everybody is scared and will stop asking for remote working privileges or shorter work weeks or work life balance.It's hard to really gauge if layoffs are really necessary or just underhanded tactics. I also have to agree with others that if executives are going to be this reactive and make big mistakes like over hiring people they had no work for, then those executives should also be on the chopping block.Like others, I get really tired of management seemingly immune to consequences for their actions when average people would be fired.","‚ÄúLean‚Äù doing three jobs for the price of one, then when I burn out or die due to the stress, they hire someone else and put the pressure on them to fill the vacancies.

It might last for years, but it only lasts as long as it's useful for both sides.Every month when I get my paycheck I say a silent \"thanks\" that the company is solvent and there was money in the bank account. Outwardly, I talk confidently about projects that won't start until next year, but it's just talk. The thing that matters at the end of the month is getting paid for the work that's been done.","Spoilers. The reason is money.Every word that comes out of this reptilian looking fucker is about money. Specifically about how he can take more from your pocket and put it into his.","they're doing it to pump stock prices, as layoffs can increase stock value greater than the productivity of keeping some people on. silicon valley also sometimes does this musical chairs thing where if one company does layoffs, a bunch do so they can try to snap up any good people who were laid off by other companies","One of the most important things to realize is the difference between what matters to a company and what matters to the people running the company. ¬†The company doesn't get a say in what happens. ¬†The people running it make the calls. ¬†For the most part, they aren't interested in a moral imperative or long-term plan. ¬†They care about next quarter or maybe next year.Stock goes up and stock goes down. ¬†The company doesn't really benefit much from short-term changes. ¬†Even longer term trends aren't all that relevant to the company's day to day. ¬†You don't have more computers and more workers one day because the stock is up 1.3% and you don't have fewer tools and staff the next day with its 2.6% drop. ¬†Only a few very significant things a company can do matter w.r.t. stock -- and those are generally undertaken by the leaders if they have a very good near-term benefit.Cities are pushing to get workers back into the office. ¬†They're offering incentives. ¬†Companies are forcing people back into the office to get that money. ¬†It's a good way to get an uptick for next quarter's earnings. ¬†Whether it's more or less productive doesn't factor in to it. ¬†Nor does the fact that once the current crisis is over, cities are going to go back to charging employment taxes and other revenue streams because there are too many cars/people/whatever commuting into the city every day.As an executive, you come on board and hope the stock is down and goes down just a bit more. ¬†If you believe it'll go back up, the lower it is today and tomorrow, the better. ¬†Any near term losses you blame on your predecessor. ¬†Then, the market turns around and stock goes up. ¬†Your compensation is primarily in stock and so you're making bank. ¬†Plus, your resume looks amazing now that the company had its turn around while you were there \"making an impact\" -- by which I mean, creating a lot of busy work while folks learn how to satisfy your demands while doing the thing the company actually needs to survive.You take credit, get a great offer with even more money at another company that's in a lull, and bounce before the bad policies you insisted on actually crumble the company. ¬†The morale tanks, the skilled labor exits, the company starts to fail... But, you're already at your next gig waiting for the market to recover.This is a jaded perspective. ¬†I'm not sure that it's entirely wrong. ¬†I think companies whose compensation came in the form of annual dividends paid out over the life of the company rather than in stock the executive dumps as quickly as they can to diversify would go a long way towards aligning incentives. ¬†Maybe the executive whose retirement depends on this company being around and successful in 20 years will care about tech debt.Until then, those good employees who care more about the actual company and its needs, who work extra hard and long to do what's actually important while also trying to tick the boxes for optics, and who get relatively little in return are the only reasons companies make it. ¬†When they go, the company goes.Middle managers everywhere are judged for promotion or hire based upon the size of their organization. ¬†Their incentive is to have bloat. ¬†Hire, hire, hire. ¬†Hire someone who's good at growing their team under you so you benefit from their efforts. ¬†Hire folks who make arguments that sound good and can get funding. ¬†That's the ticket! ¬†Don't keep a lean organization filled with people passionate about the company and knowledgeable about its needs. ¬†That'll get you nowhere fast.Executives and middle managers see the company as a means towards their own ends. ¬†If you're confused about why things are the way they are, this is likely why. ¬†You're thinking about the company and the values and goals it has. ¬†You're not thinking today, what can I do to make my boss richer even if it means destroying everything. ¬†That's the power of misaligned incentives. ¬†Zuckerberg lays folks off to balance the detrimental effects of those leaders and their inherent need to grow their orgs.","Companies are realizing that, while painful, there are benefits to being \"leaner.\"So basically what Zuckerberg is saying is:\"I'm a big fan of money.

This is all while my team has literally lost some of the most important people we have and it took several months before top level bosses became concerned that customers were being told that features they were promised will not be delivered. The developers working on them are gone though so it‚Äôs not difficult to parse out why. I‚Äôm not saying all of these companies don‚Äôt legitimately have reasons for layoffs.

I told him my situation, so he told me to email him directly for this position and he'll have some folks look into my denial. It was discovered that my resume has been denied because the AI hiring tool would only accept resumes and hiring documents that were in Times New Roman AND the system was designed to find key words and phrases, but was accidentally programmed to look for exact, word for word phrases.

From the very beginning Wired has been the Car and Driver of tech - have you ever seen a truly bad review of a car? They published a freaking hagiography of Canadian tar sands mining.

I measure that against the content provider‚Äôs general reputation, both currently and historically.

My perception of what is ‚Äúreal‚Äù is a perpetual process of apprehending information and separating what I deem is true from what I deem as either false or irrelevant.The point I am clumsily trying to make is that there is an implicit relationship between the content provider and the consumer of the content that can only be verified by the base knowledge, intuition, and discerning wisdom of the consumer.
