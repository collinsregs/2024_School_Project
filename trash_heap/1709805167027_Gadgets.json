They took the handheld portion of their highest selling console of all time (Nintendo DS, and 2nd best selling - GameBoy) and combined it with the motion control joysticks of their 3rd best selling console (Wii).They did this at a time where mobile gaming was blowing up, and tablet sales showed they weren't just a fad.I'd say the 'riskiest' part of their release of the Switch was to not offer streaming services on it.
