[{"text":["‘When you use a Walkman all the memories come back’: the people still in love with old tech","Why such a nightmare photo?","Ive been looking for a good cassette player for a while now. Apparently all the new ones use the same less than desirable parts. Soon as spring hits, ill be hitting up some rummage/garage/tag sales for old ones.","I dont think its about “memories” it thinks about the fact that you own what you bought. With physical there is a relief that comes with the fact that your purchase is yours. Additionally when you buy physical its all packages together so you are more likely to listen ti an album cover to cover as the artist intended.","Cassettes? If we’re talking about QUALITY of music the order goes cassette, cd, vinyl being the best. So people wanna go back to tapes which have worse quality than even digital. Nah, I like hearing my music without the hiss.","I had a few different versions of the Walkman, they were good devices, but I've never thought about going back to them. I use my phone. I don't miss cassettes, and the radio where I live has only three stations that come decently, and those are all owned by the same company and plagued with ads. Digital music or streaming is so much more manageable."],"points":2}]
