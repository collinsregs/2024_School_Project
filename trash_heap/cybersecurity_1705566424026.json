Because of that, we often struggle to communicate the security requirements and security concerns in a way those people really understand what the real impacts to the organisation are, and they have too much personality to admit it.That gives you a storm where yes, the leadership thinks security is important in moderation and balance, but their balance is skewed in a different direction to our own because their ego wants to see them leave a mark, and security doesn‚Äôt leave a mark.

Because if you upgrade Apache to get rid of that vulnerability, then the web app that is running there won't work because the devs for the app haven't made it work properly with the new version (or whatever).So now you have a vulnerability that's just sitting there. You scanned it, you know about it, but you can't patch it.So now you have to manage it as part of your plan. You document that it's there. You run a risk analysis. You determine if your existing mitigations are sufficient. You add mitigations as needed.And THEN, someone in executive management needs to sign off to accept the residual risk in light of the potential likelihood and impact of exploitation.","vulnerability and patch management is a joint responsibility.The only real way to stay on top of CVE is to use a vulnerability scanner like Tenable.io or Qualys. There are not enough people to constantly chase after CVEs. Even with a large team, it's easy to miss a CVEs if not using a tool. A vulnerability scanner is the only way to go. However, a scanner will only search for potential misconfiguration and missing patches. There are vulnerabilities that are neither misconfiguration nor missing patches. Those are done by humans. In addition, we all subscribe to different forums, so we use those to see what the new vulnerabilities are out there.Regularly. I require that my team (InfoSec) and the system owner review it on at least a bi-weekly basis.A joint effort between InfoSec and the system owner. As a CISO, the responsibility for the system's security falls upon the team that owns it. InfoSec is there to be more of the \"auditor\" and ensure they follow policy and procedures. However, I have always stated that when \"shit hits the fan\" - I don't care about the blame game.For Scanner, I have used both Tenable.io and Qualys. I like Tenable.io better. For managing the vulnerabilities, I use Tenable or Qualys. However, for risks, I have a risk registry.Varies depending on the size of the organization. Also - the more frequently you do the assessment, the less time it takes each time you do it.","I like to think vulnerability management is a check on patch management.

Certainly, Cybersecurity salaries are MUCH higher than average pay, including CEO pay for example.Salaries are higher in Ireland than Poland for example, in some cases by 10X but portable skills like IT and Finance see difference of 20-50%Another reason is cost of living.

My boss had 4/5 Linux, very skilled and extreme work ethic. This person regularly clocked 60 hour weeks while managing a whole team and pulling on-call duty. Most companies would've wanted to clone my boss a dozen times. Accenture fired them for being too expensive, they were making $85K. If you can't keep someone who's very skilled and working their guts out employed then your entire business model is flawed.","Defense. Used to work in that sector and made great money, but the job security is terrible. Many defense companies will lay off personnel and then rehire those positions within a year.","Russia.","Amazon - heard plenty. I enjoy having a decent work/life balance.Federal Contracts - every single one I‚Äôve ever been on has been a cluster.Dedicated pentesting firms - generally fun because you work with a lot of great people, but it‚Äôs definitely the kind of job that can burn you out. And in my experience, you‚Äôre surrounded by people who eat, live and breathe the stuff and research it on their off time. And that‚Äôs by no means a bad thing if it‚Äôs how you like to spend your free time. But If you‚Äôre more the ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather go fishing after work‚Äù type, it‚Äôs a little bit harder to truly fit the culture.","Won't work in anywhere gambling/racing related, oil/gas related, or media/propoganda orgs like newscorp/subsidiaries.Prefer working for things that benefit people, like healthcare, public services. Doesn't pay the best obviously, but its definitely interesting, coming up with solutions on limited budgets, usually having much more power to change things than in a large or high profit org.","Meta. The 2016 election and the impact social media has had on people's mental health is a bridge too far for me. Also Zuck as a person is a weirdo his whole VR push just made me feel gross.","Judging from what I have heard from colleagues. Bank's. Everything is super serious, no fun to be had, no joking around, nothing. That doesn't fit my personality.","Private sector, never again. I am staying in Public Sector / Government work. I work a 9-5. That‚Äôs enough for me.","India.","Marathon Petroleum, Randstad, Trane Technologies, CapGemini.","Tobacco companies. Disney.","I'd never consider healthcare. Too many regulations and too much risk if things fail. I work in a factory. If the computers go down, it is a little more of a struggle to make widgets and we may make a few less widgets that day.

Edit: love what his companies accomplish but would never work for him.","Big 4, DoD, and Palantir.","Any triple letter agency üòÖ","US DoD - they should hard offload info/cybersecurity to contractorsHospitals - mild ptsd causingHealth Insurance providers specifically but insurers in general - you havent seen tech debt til youve seen these folksSmall US Universities - higher ed is crumbling and these will go first.

The money is better but the ethical issues I have with the industry outweigh that.","Shit all these people saying anything with a clearance has me wanting to go back into cleared work. üòÇ I should be asking for a lot more money, clearly.","Indian managers","The general consensus in this thread: there is no company worth working for, just be homeless","Government. Just don't want to be a part of that system.","Why would you rule out two entire industries where there are a ton of security roles?","Defense 100%. Loads of military contractors in my area but I want nothing to do with a company that produces weapon systems.","Boeing, good starting point but honestly not a good place overall.Based on what I saw, I would go ahead and say probably the whole avionics space, except Rolls Royce, the little work I did do with them, they seemed higher quality and workers didn't seem stressed. Would be interested at working directly for the FAA, but I question the pay they could offer, but that is mainly cause government shouldn't be overworked.","CGI","Financial sector (Australia). Too many regulations and weekly audits.","Apple and Tesla","PwC - It's a cult","Dark Army, White Rose or Ecorp","Maybe it's preference but I prefer smaller companies. Any company large enough to have a corporate culture and ideology other than 'get the work done' is not for me.","Crypto - hell no, too much risk. Of all the industries that seems like the biggest house of cards ready to fall, at least for an IC role at a single company.","Accenture","AWS","Banking. I'd rather not say why but I'm a data engineer/software developer.","Fortra. I‚Äôve heard horror stories about their treatment of workers and the illusion their software should provide. Also, 2 sysadmin friends quit after being tasked with administrating one of their products.","Anything defense, and most social media, also fuck Ebay in particular.Not that I could get roles at most of the large orgs in those spaces, but just hypothetically speaking I wouldn't feel good knowing that I was working to help them and accepting their ill-gotten gains.Adding in a who + what: I think for the most part I'd avoid Analyst roles at most MSSPs. Nothing inherently wrong with those companies or roles, and they're probably great as a first role in the industry to build experience. I've just never experienced more burnout in my life than when I was scrambling to work alerts from across a shitload of environments for 10 hours straight every day for 6 days a week.","70% of places will be good. But the following industries might be closer to 50/50:Healthcare (they don‚Äôt pay nor take cyber seriously)MSP/MSSP (meatgrinders)FAANG (but you‚Äôll get paid big for your pain)Big 4 (you‚Äôll get paid a little for your pain)That said, you still have a 50% chance of liking the bad industries.","video game companies tend to attract the most horrible human beings in IT Security, and sometimes they also turn the nicest people into horrible human beings.",""],"points":2069},{"text":["Project Ideas for MSc Computer Forensics and Cyber Security","See related:https://old.reddit.com/r/u_fabledparable/comments/17xlmrc/cybersecurity_mentorship_references/k9oyt7a/"],"points":0},{"text":["Edge - process creation log"],"points":0},{"text":["Seeking Insights on Qlik Sense Vulnerability (CVE-2023-41265) - Discrepancy in Pentesting Results","are you using any burp extensions to smuggle http?"],"points":0},{"text":["How detailed do you get with your playbooks?","The ones I write are more detailed (similar to the second example) but that‚Äôs mostly because the analysts on my team have a wide spectrum of experience and I don‚Äôt have much autonomy on who gets hired. That, and it removes a lot of plausible deniability if I catch a mistake during the QA checks.","High level and only detail where I think it needs it. You should already have qualified staff that understand how to execute the steps. And you would have tested the playbooks as well ahead of time.","High level, however I either add an actions template to the runbook or a ticket template for each runbook which would link out to a guide on how to. They serve as reminders to a) do each step required for experience folk that know what they‚Äôre doing but may overlook a step accidentally and b) for in experienced folk that may need additional documentationFor example ‚ÄúBlock IP address in X‚Äù would either have templates on how to request these with the relevant teams (email, tickets etc) OR how-to guides on access portal(s) and where to add the indicator to block. To note: these would be linking out from the runbook or ticket template. No one needs a 30 page doc to triage phishing!","Playbooks cover the high level process. An example in a malware detection playbook would be ‚ÄúScan Malware for IOCs‚Äù.Runbooks cover step by step detail. An example in a malware analysis runbook would be to ‚ÄúRight click the file, hover over 7zip, go to CRC SHA, and find the SHA-256 hash.

I have been doing this for multiple companies over the years, they are def some what different depending on industry trends and user preferences.","Playbooks are shelfware, only there so you can show them to someone who requires you have them for an audit or something. There is no need for them to be fully detailed.","I do mine at a high level, and provide links to \"work instructions\" if there's any chance of ambiguity causing an issue for a specific step.An example would be me creating a work instruction on how to pull an email using DarkTrace, with the phishing response playbook stating that any malicious emails need to be pulled and linking to that work instruction, rather than writing that in the playbook.¬†When it comes to what I would say needs analysed in a potential phish email then I give a list of bullet points as a baseline minimum, and state that clearly.","What are IoCs?","I write them as step by step, with screen shots.
