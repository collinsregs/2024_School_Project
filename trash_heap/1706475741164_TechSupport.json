You could plug in a streaming stick like Chromecast to the projector, though usually projectors don't have audio output.","Usually you need a cable set-top box (conventional TV) or a small computer (smart TV). And then the cable box/computer can connect through RCA/Component/HDMI/VGA to the projector.If you watch broadcast TV (Antennae), you will need a (USB or PCIe) TV adapter connected to the computer and a program to watch it (VLC or mythTV or proprietary program from the hardware vendor).Projector with HDMI connection and/or audio connectors may come with speakers but the quality may be a bit iffy depending on your requirements.","not sure about projectors today are they still optimal in a dark room, do they still use bulbs or are there any led ones","If you're wanting to watch live TV through an aerial cable on a projector, you'll need some kind of tuner / converter. It's possible, but kinda annoying.For my projector I use a fire TV stick running Plex and some of those Xbox branded USB TV tuners for like £4 each plugged into my Plex server.A lot of people however use the officially supported HDHomeRun that allows streaming live TV over the network, and apparently Plex integrates very well and it's pretty seamless, plus you can record stuff and save it to your Plex library if you're into that, as well as have access to your local live TV from anywhere if you're away from home.","I replaced my TV with the xgimi horizon pro and love it absolutely finally that big black box is gone. It can do everything my TV could. I game on it and watch movies on it. I project it directly onto my wall.I have to say I am not a daily user of neither projector nor tv, so if you need that I cannot speak to it. but I watch some shows and so on and it has been a great decision.","check out the Samsung freestyle. I didnt used to recomend projectors to my customers but i have sold 4 of these and the feedback from my clients has been amazing.https://www.samsung.com/ca/projectors/the-freestyle/the-freestyle-sp-lff3claxxzc/","No! Projectors do not have tuners built in to them! You will need to connect a video source to them.","I do but I don't watch TV like most people where I turn it on and have it running in the background all the time.Projectors use more energy than a TV so that would be an increase to the electric bill.I have my projector connected to a Google TV puck and use that to play stuff off my remote and local Plex servers for stuff like TV shows and movies. Previously it used to be connected directly to my PC via (long) HDMI cableI do have a TV tuner to get stuff over the air but I rarely rarely use it cause I don't watch broadcast TV regularly.Projectors have some advantages but some disadvantages too.

You may need some hdmi audio adapters and some smart tv devices but it’s definitely possible.","It's possible, but you need to hook the projector to a source to watch tv","Yes. I replaced my tv with a projector 10 years ago. You will want a projector with a hdmi and audio port. Most projectors have very bad speakers built into them. Then you can connect your ps4, xbox, cable box etc into the projector you buy. Also, it is not necessary to buy a screen for your projector. Just shine it on your wall. If you have many things you want plugged into the projector, purchase a \"hdmi switch. \"","Generally, the projector will accept HDMI in so it could display output from a cable or satellite box that has HDMI out.They don't have good speakers (if at all) so that means you'll need to route the HDMI or audio to a AV receiver and speakers or a sound bar.Finally, if you want to connect for streaming to a router, then probably not. You'd need something like a Roku or other box to decode the data stream and output a video signal appropriate for your projector.Projectors need a brilliant light source, and that often means at least a little heat and fan noise, but often a lot of heat and fan noise.Setting all that aside, without a proper screen and light control, a projector won't live up to a TV for picture quality, people walking in front of it block the image, and it will need to have the proper throw and lens to achieve the picture size in focus for your room. It also has to be positioned in a way that keystoning can be corrected and doesn't cause the picture to be noticable brighter on the nearer side of the image. This means some research to find the lens and project that works in your application. They're not all alike.","I replaced my TV in the living room with a benq w1070 projector back in 2015, 135\" screen, 3d capable, 1080p, still going strong.

Should be able to go through at Step 4, as DHCP should work so you don't have to assign IP manually. https://askubuntu.com/questions/359856/share-wireless-internet-connection-through-ethernet","Best bet is to google \"linux internet connection sharing\" and throw in your brand of linux.Essentially you need to get the machine with the internet connection (linux box) to act as a router for your windows box. This is ICS (internet connection sharing).Essentially your linux machine gets its internet connection and uses your router as its gateway. The linux machine then shares that connection to the rest of your network. Usually it does so by creating a new 'private' network, and the Linux box would get an additional IP on that network, so your linux box would exist on both your home LAN (the router) and a private network simultaneously. Any machine using that shared connection would have their gateway set to this Linux additional IP.Traffic goes from the windows box to the linux private network. The linux box then routes the traffic to your normal home LAN and directs traffic out via your router. All outgoing connections from your windows box are logged on the the linux machine, so when traffic returns from the internet the linux box can determine whether they are local (returning traffic for itself), or traffic for the shared network. In the second case it uses its own internal routing to get the traffic to the right host on the private network.","You want to bridge the LAN connection with the WiFi connection.  But why not just get a cheap USB WiFi card for the other computer?","First thing you'd need is a cross-over CAT6 cable; Peer to Peer connections require this.
