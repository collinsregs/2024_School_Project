The CFO CEO is right, these margins are terrible and pretty risky.This is why sony is literally following the xbox path.

Maybe it has to do with the pricing of 70+ bucks.I'm not sure what the solution is but its weird to sell tons of consoles but not make any real money. The players are not buying enough software.
