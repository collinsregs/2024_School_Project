I saw a lot of EVs in used car dealerships that couldn‚Äôt sell because suddenly new Teslas were cheaper than used ones. The dealerships or original owners are now in a tough spot, where the dealership might have to sell it at a loss, or the original owner might have to sell it for less than they owe on their loan.This was also exacerbated by the prices being too high in 2021-2022. Owners overpaid for the cars and so when Tesla had large prices cuts in 2023 that meant the owners couldn‚Äôt sell their cars to break even on their loans. This situation affected ICE owners as well but ICE manufacturers weren‚Äôt cutting prices as far. Also because Tesla has 55% market share for EVs in the U.S., when they cut prices that far it hits the entire EV sector in the U.S.","Early adopters pay more initially in pretty much any product as technology advances quickly. This shouldn't be a surprise.","This has always been the case since the 2nd gen Nissan Leaf. EV technology advances rapidly rendering past generations less competitive for the used cost. All rapidly maturing technology has a similar problem.","How much of this is because prices have been going down for new cars due to increased competition and supply?","Yes. Because you can get a $7500 rebate on a car when you buy it new. Most cannot get any rebate at all on a used one.So the moment you drive it off the lot its value drops $7500 plus whatever amount other cars lose due to \"preference for new\".Then there is the improvement of new vehicles versus old. If I buy a new Accord it's really barely different than a ten year old one in capability. But if I buy an EV the new one is far better. Charges faster, goes further. etc.When the Tesla Model 3 came out it was overall, a better car than the Model S was. That means someone could get a new car for about $40K that car that was better than a Model S. So any used model S had to be sold for less than $40K. Even though it cost $80K-$90K new. Yeah, that's gonna hurt.It's really not hard to see why this happens. And it mostly isn't inherent to EVs. It just market conditions due to how EVs are being sold right now and rapid advances in the vehicles.","I think most tech enthusiasts knew that's what's gona happen,the EVs don't break down like the gas motor ones but when it's time to change that battery,you're f'cked","Because they were artifically inflated during COVID. I remember brand new Mini Electrics costing ¬£21,000 before COVID that suddenly became ¬£29,000 during. Super cheap electric econoboxes at the ¬£18-19,000 mark were dropped completely, and a glut of promised ¬£30,000 priced cars all entered the market at ¬£40,000+. I consider the rapid drop to be an estimation of the true value the cars had when they were sold, which was all roughly 10k lower than what RRP was.","Used car prices have been heading in the right direction after months of elevated values and inventory shortages. Even so, the values of some vehicles have declined much faster than others, with EVs doing the heavy lifting. Automotive data outfit iSeeCars' latest study looked at used car values over the past year, finding that used electric vehicles are dropping at a much faster rate than their gas-powered counterparts.While used car values have been dropping overall over the past year, used EVs have dropped like a stone in comparison. iSeeCars found that the average for used electric models fell by up to almost 32 percent since 2023, while the used gas vehicle average price sank by just 3.6 percent. Used EV pricing trends over the past year look like this:February 2024: -31.8%January 2024: -30.8%December 2023: -31.2%November 2023: -33.7%October 2023: -33.7%September 2023: -39.1%August 2023: -38.7%July 2023: -34.7%June 2023: -29.5%May 2023: -29.9%","The cost is too high.

I thought, \"Wow, a Toyota for nearly a third of the list price. Such a deal.\" The deal was legit, and the car was very nice. However, it is hydrogen-powered, and part of the deal was $15,000 in hydrogen credits for fuel. I live in a metropolitan area of almost 10 million people, which has about a dozen hydrogen stations, and the closest was twenty miles away. That might have been manageable. Then, I happened to be talking with a friend who operates a body shop. He told me they had a year-old Murai in with a banged-up quarter panel.

What?","Without doing any research I'd generalize many people looking for their first EV are looking in the ~5-10 year-old range. At that age with an original battery, the management system will do it's best with the inbuilt metrology instruments to give a good estimate of remaining life and range, but it doesn't account for volatility.

The following discussion will make more sense with a map of the city open. https://maps.app.goo.gl/UHV1YqUVuGvKXspt5This is a governance failure spanning at least 30 years, and in that span, all 3 major parties as well as permutations of coalitions have held the seat of Chief Minister (head of the state/province) for a significant amount of time.The older parts of Bengaluru were built with a municipal freshwater connection (Kaveri river water, from the KRS dam). Malleswaram, Basavanagudi, Jayanagar, early phases of JP Nagar, etc.However, areas newer in comparison, rely heavily and often exclusively on bore-well water. Sometimes, these bore-wells go deeper than 2000 feet before they strike water. Naturally, the water table has dropped and the underground reservoirs and aquifers are going dry fast. This includes the newer areas like Whitefield, KR Puram, Bellandur, Nagwara, and Electronics City.All this has happened in the de-facto absence of any regulatory environment for the exploitation of underground water sources. When a regulation can be overlooked by a bribe, it's not a regulation at all.Now, the newest of this lot, idk, since pre-COVID or so, don't even bother with borewells or Kaveri water. They rely completely on tanker water. Areas like Devanahalli (where the airport is!!!) and the far reaches of the Whitefield-Sarjapur belt are like this.Yeah. A long line of water tanker trucks outside the apartment complex.Now, in summers of drought, the demand for these tankers goes through the roof. So these guys have been extorting homeowners. In their infinite wisdom (/s/s), the state government decided to enact a price cap (that they have no means to enforce) and tried to requisition the trucks for the government to deploy (in which they would naturally be very inefficient and very corrupt).So suddenly, many places can't get a tanker at all. QED.The root cause of this is unplanned expansion with thought only to cutting up the land and selling it to developers, without a single thought to infrastructure, including roads and road layouts, piped water and piped sewage, electrical distribution and public transportation.The various divisions of the local and state government have only been bothered about land acquisition, allotment and resale. The BDA (Bangalore Development Authority) runs amok and the BBMP (the municipal government) is hand-in-glove.
