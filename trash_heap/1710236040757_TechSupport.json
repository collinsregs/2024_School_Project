But see if this article sheds any light. https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/asus-routers-targeted-by-botnet-malware-heres-how-to-protect-your-device","Yes. The Mirai botnet is one notable example.Resetting your devices to factory, ensuring they are completely updated, and have strong passwords/are secured is the best way to prevent/get rid of infection. If your device is older and not receiving updates it's usually good security practice to make an upgrade as soon as reasonably possible.","linklink alsoThis is the notification I received. I crossed out the ip cause I honestly don’t who’s it is.","Let me present an alternate posibility. Since all devices on your network connect to Comcast through your router. Comcast detected unusual network traffic and traced it back to your router. Comcast can't see past its connection to your router (your router uses network address translation that somewhat obscures network traffic origins).Issue 1: It's possible that a single device on your network has been infected with botnet maleware and is generating the traffic.Action Item 1: Run virus scans on all your PC's and Mac's (yes Mac's can have maleware too). Start with the device youbuse for work. If you dont have paid antivirus, use Windows Defender. Run a Defender scan and then update Windows and then scan again (Windows update also updates Defender scan definitions). Phones and tablets don't usually host maleware like this unless you install apps from places other then the App or Play stores.Issue 2: It's also possible that someone hacked into your wifi and used your connection to generate the traffic.Action Item 2: If you're able to, try to log into the admin portal of your router and see if you can poke around and see a list of connected devices. Your router might have a section called DHCP leases. The leases last 7 days or so and act as a log of every device that has connected to your router in the last week. Review this lists to see if you have an unknown device.Botnet maleware doesn't usually spread by proximity. So if one device is infected, the others are not necessarily infected. Unless they both aquired the same infected file, separately.If you use a corporate device, contact your IT department, explain what happened and ask if you need to have your device scanned. You most likely have a VPN, which will protect the customer data in transit. Even if you use a web portal to process customer data, it's safe as long as you're using https:// (the S is for secure encryption) and your website operaters set it up properly.You might also contact Comcast and find out more details about the nature of the unusual traffic.Hope this helps and good luck!","Can a router get a virus? I mean technically it’s possible but extremely unlikely.It’s sort of hard to make sense of what you are saying. Your router can’t attack another network and I can’t imagine there’s even a pop up that says that.“The IP of the target”. Your router should have a list of all the items connected to the network.

Maybe Snapchat (especially if the police are asking) would give all the private messages the account is doing, in case its doing it to other people too.If someone is impersonating you, especially if it is personal and not a random scammer, it could be serious and thus police might be good to as self-defense from what the person might be attempting to do.EDIT: There is probably some position at your work you should also report this to, whether it's human resources or a manager or what, to make sure it is clear and documented, what is happening.EDIT 2: I read that you are new to the country and assume that means also new to the company, and also it would mean that whomever is doing this would somehow know where you are working and the colleague to text. So that kind of narrows things down and makes it clear that it may be personally targeted. Impersonation is fraud and is a criminal matter and thus the police are ones who can address it.Also what did your manager say about it? Did they express appropriate concern and identify it as possibly a legal matter (either as impersonation, or as harassment)?EDIT 3: If you're new to a company, and someone makes it seem like you're inappropriately harassing a co-worker, there's probably a high chance that someone wants to make it very bad environment for you at the company. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's what it feels like to me. The manager may not be considerate to that, butt the police won't have any conflict-of-interest in the situation, and Snapchat may only provide records to the police, and those records are evidence that you may need to use to prove it isn't you (or find out who it is).","I highly suggest documenting everything and filing a police report, even if they do nothing.

This has absolutely no minerals, and thus, can not conduct electricity as long as it stays clean enough, though Isopropyl would be preferred unless there are some things on it that are only water soluble, such as sugar.Leave it to dry for at least 24h with Isopropyl and at least 48h with water rinse, if you do both, use the water rinse first as it will help you pull out any remaining water.Do not use paper towels to dry it, use a lint free antistatic cloth if you want to dry it, or carefully use some compressed air, you better hold that gas can dead level though or you might cause more damage.Do the same to your Motherboard, I can't imagine the MB to work fine, unless the GPU was mounted somewhere else in the case than directly in the slot, horizontally (e.g. not using a riser).Just for completeness, I do NOT recommend rinsing your PSU, if you somehow use conductive liquid, open it up, or in any way, shape, or form touch the capacitor contacts, this could electrocute you.
