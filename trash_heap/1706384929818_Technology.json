Police are able to contact Ring users off the app. And Ring users can still decide if they want to voluntarily send video, sounds or images from their Ring devices to law enforcement.‚ÄúRing users should also know that when police knock on their door, they have the right to, and should, request that police get a warrant before handing over footage,‚Äù if they don‚Äôt want to turn over footage, Guariglia said.","\"‚ÄúRing shutting down the ‚Äòred carpet‚Äô surveillance portal they offered to police is unquestionably a victory for the coalition of racial justice and human rights advocates that have been calling to end these partnerships for years.\"Just so everyone knows, the police have never been able to directly access your Ring cloud storage account without your knowledge and permission. If they wanted to do that, they would have to get a search warrant wherein they requested footage from a specific timeframe. That's always been the situation. This article concerns a practice within the \"Neighbors\" portion of the Ring App wherein the police would ask people to upload relevant surveillance video about a certain incident. People could either cooperate or not. It's literally not different than a \"request for information\" billboard.Amazon - in the most gratuitously racist move I've ever seen - shut this down because, apparently, they believe that the surveillance video will necessarily hurt black people, who they presume are the ones the footage will depict engaging in criminal activity.

            "The era of the AI-generated internet is already here","It was already here for years.","Slow news day at Mashable.","insert internet explorer meme","By \"here\" if you meet literally right here you are definitely correct","The idea of widespread model collapse is incredibly dumb.If you train on human-generated content, you end up teaching it patterns that occur in \"natural\" human-generated content so that it can reproduce those patterns in \"synthetic\" AI-generated content. The goal isn't reproducing any \"natural\" content, it's solving the problem of telling the model what's \"correct\" output for given inputs. Train blindly on other synthetic data, and you will probably find a mix of \"correct\" ideas and \"incorrect\" ideas and be reinforcing \"incorrect\" data as \"correct\" some of the time, and that process is obviously one that would deteriorate if iterated.The thing is, it's not some magical property of \"natural\" content that models get ideas of \"correctness\" from. If you train on high-quality, well-labelled synthetic data, then that's \"correct\" enough to satisfy the needs of training. If model collapse is a risk, then training methods will simply be changed to avoid that sort of degradation. If adversarial noise (that try to trick models into learning \"incorrect\" ideas) is a risk (and it's unclear to what degree tools like Nightshade are effective at all), then training will add tweaks like bilateral filtering to defeat them, or perhaps someone will design an efficient classifier model to detect them (it's polite, after all, to accept adversarial noise as a request to not train on a given image, even though the nature of that request is not so polite).More significantly, the issue is going to be trying to make increasingly good open models that anyone can use on consumer-grade hardware. It's a problem that these tools aren't more widely usable directly by the public but instead are often controlled by large corporations like Microsoft who can and will design experiences designed to extract money from their users. Proponents of AI regulation need to make sure that they actually hurt corporate use‚Äîespecially when these corporations already have enough money or large enough media libraries to train their own models no matter what the law decides about the legality of training on publicly-visible images from the Internet. I'd rather a world where Stable Diffusion exists than one with a very profitable oligopoly for corporations like Adobe, Getty, Microsoft, and OpenAI."

They have starting weights at each node, and as they train the weights are modified to minimise the output error from training samples. The rate of change is limited, but generally weights change quite a bit early on but much more slowly as training progresses. So what can happen is that networks can be overly influenced by \"early\" training data, and get caught in particular states that they can't escape from. You can think of it as a ping pong ball bouncing down a mountain, with the \"goal\" being to get to the bottom. Gravity will move it in the right direction based on local conditions (slopes), but if it takes a wrong turn early on it can end up in a large crater that isn't the bottom, but it can't get out because it can't go back and change course.Interestingly, people have exactly the same tendencies. We create particular neural pathways early in life that are extremely difficult to change, which is why habits and beliefs that are reinforced heavily during childhood are very difficult to shake later in life.There are a lot more learning models that have been proposed to overcome this issue, but it's not a simple thing to do. What is really required, just like in people, is more closely supervised learning during the \"early\" life of these networks. Don't let it start training on bad examples early on, and you will build a network that is resilient to those things later on. Feeding in unfiltered, raw data to a brand new network will have extremely unpredictable results, just like dropping a newborn into an adult environment with no supervision would lead to a somewhat messed up adult.","Computers are not that scary.

The French Defense Ministry pointed to a ‚Äúcoordinated Russian effort‚Äù involving state media outlets such as Sputnik News, RT, and RIA Novosti.France has been the \"target of a Russian disinformation campaign\" since Russian forces invaded the neighboring country in February 2022, Paris indicated. According to French officials, this campaign escalated from mid-January when President Emmanuel Macron warned of the threat posed by a potential Russian victory on the front line and announced new military aid for Ukraine.On January 17, the Russian Ministry of Defence reported a strike by Russian forces on a temporary military deployment site in Kharkiv, which was said to be composed mostly of \"French mercenaries\" fighting alongside Kyiv.
