And it‚Äôs targeting a rival program from T-Mobile ‚Äî the third-biggest wireless carrier in the US, which has started selling its own broadband service.","spectrum is trash and runs a monopoly","Returned my Spectrum modem today. Had them out twice last week due to intermittent drops that would last 2 to 20 minutes - usually in the middle of a Teams call. They said it was my WiFi router, so I replaced it. Still happened. They came out again and said everything looked good on their end and it was my equipment. When I told them I replaced my router they shrugged and left. I switched to MetroNet and now no drops.","Been using T-Mobile 5G Home Internet for about 2 years now and it works flawlessly. MS Teams, 4k streaming, xbox x gaming, it handles all of it. Customer support is really good as well. The one time I did have issues it was fixed in about 10 minutes.Spectrum / Charter are absolute garbage from a customer service standpoint. The networks are generally out of date. And the costs just go up and up every year.

It's been about three years and I still can't get a VPN to work with it's crap trash can modem. (As in, looks like a trash can.) Forget tech support, this is only supported by a small team in the Philippines who don't speak English and barely know how to turn on a computer. Also, when I first got it, I didn't get it. I had to complain and they said they want money for the one they sent. I went down the street hoping and finally found out where the morons sent itIt has also just raised prices and established a data cap, both of which they weren't supposed to do.If something can beat it, go for it.

I have a feeling it would be less of an issue if we were using IPv6, but that's out of my hands.","Well... im stuck with spectrum.

Once these scientists realized that, if they release sterilized males (by literally blasting them with radiation) en masse, those sterile males will just overwhelm normal males in sheer volume, have sex with females, and she will lay non-viable eggs. If done repeatedly, this will cause a population crash and effectively eradicate local population of screwworm flies without using pesticides or chemicals.
