If you take one \"intro to python\" course that is pretty much what it would feel like. As though the skill is just knowing a language and doing some basic translation. And an LLM can surely do that trick reasonably well, so I suppose they guess you won't need a programmer anymore.But I think the reality, at least for good programmers, is that they have to understand the domain and the technology, and then build a model for how the technology solves domain problems or supports domain activities. At least according to Naur in \"Programming as Theory Building\", this is the job. Importantly, much of the theory that Naur is talking about is tacit - not something that's in the code, and its hard to capture in documentation too.I don't believe current generations of LLMs have any theory about the world (or any domain in it) or how code relates to them. I'm not sure at all that AI won't someday be able to do that. But at that point, every other job out there will also have been replaced. Almost tautologically, the people who can express domain theories to a computer will be the last ones out of a job, if the task is to replace all jobs.","Anytime soon?

It's hopefully nowhere near that,” he added.I was one of those 100k. Three power poles were down in the road right in front of our house, and that was just one small part of the whole calamity that stretched up and down the street. It took six and a half days to get our power back, and another week for Internet.Hope Linus had an easier time of it.","“Because this whole \"I make up problems, and then I write overly complicated crap code to solve them\" has to stop,.” I laughed too hard with this one.

He might be a dick but damn he cares about the quality of the kernelThat thread though is interesting because it ends up with a good amount of discussion and coaching him through how to correctly implementing a fix. So he flamed him but still willing to help.. weirdThis made me lol thoughNow some of this was needed due to the way the dir wrapper worked so I may be able to revisit this and possibly just use an ei->ref counter. But I wasted enough time on this and I'm way behind in my other responsibilities, so this is not something I can work on now.Ironically, one of the responsibilities that I've been putting off to fix up eventfs was writing that document on a support group for maintainer burnout. :-p","The ol boy still has it. (sheds a tear).","And then Linus continues to help the guy improve these changes over the next few days. So yes the first e-mail might be a bit abrasive but he also takes a lot of time explaining what he wants change, how he wants it changed and why it should be changed.To the people that want to tell their colleagues off. Don't forget to do the second part as well.","I suspect the guy might have done also other things to piss him off. Besides the crappy code.","Lot of people in this thread find it funny, thinking they know people who deserve such treatment. But no one says \"I'd love to receive feedback exactly like this when I fuck up\".A workplace where senior engineers berate junior engineers like this is not one I'd want to work at.Linus is still the goat when it comes to technical chops, but he needs to show leadership without letting his anger get the better of him.","He focused on criticizing the code, not the person. He's still much better than he used to be.","The penguin emperor, all hail","The penguin emperor wroteI don't know if I want to be forever known as the penguin emperor lmao","I know a lot of people look up to him, but that is not healthy behavior to model.","It worries me that, at some point, Linus will stop working in the kernel (either retire or...). He's very strict about what goes into the kernel and code quality. What'd happen if he wasn't there?","I know everyone is involved with the language quite a lot but the actual patch series is interesting. The original reason for this whole thing is that eventfs with distinct inodes and dentries is a memory hog. But if you don’t have distinct inodes many things won’t work. Tar is the obvious one, but you can’t export over NFS etc., right? You need a distinct fileid even in ro or you’ll get strange behavior. At the least you’ll need to turn off delegation. And there’s a use-case for that since you can build an easy remote eventfs system with that in theory.But I have to try this myself to see why this is a dumb idea. It’s not immediately obvious but these guys have been working with this thing since before I was a teen. There might be some obvious reason what I’m saying is dumb.","I'm so confused why people have such a hard time being direct and not an asshole.

Otherwise if you let everyone do what they wish, the code would quickly turn into a big ball of mud.","/r/linusrants baybe","Why are we still giving non-stories like these attention? People give feedback on code everyday - the only fasicnation people have with Linus is the way he interacts with people. And IMO that's really not a good thing.

This isn't direct or honest, he's just having a fit. I can't tell how right he is, but even if everything was exactly as he said it, it's still not the thing to doWhen I was a student a guy like this turned some of my mondays into hell (reading insulting reviews isn't great), and later I was trying to help other devs coping with this kind of crap. At least for me it never really did anything, but make me emotional and angry at myself. It strengthens this idea that one would identify with ones own code. And that's BS. Linus should recommend a resource or let someone else review it for him to filter bad PRs like that.It's just fucking exhausting.","It amazes me that Linus still can show he knows the intimate details of almost any function in Linux even after all these decades of development and how complex the kernel has grown.Also I always love when Linus lets this side of himself out onto the LKML.
