[{"text":["A cargo ship’s ‘WindWing’ sails saved it up to 12 tons of fuel per day","argh mateys; we’re so fucking back","TIL: cargo ships use more than 12 tons of fuel per day.","For larger ships, there is also a neat sail known as the rotary sail. It's incredibly strange, resembling a cilinder, but it saves a significant amount of fuel.","Awesome. Implement it on a large scale.","Add more sails! Remove the engines completely! Add cannons for defense against pirates! Arrrrgg!","How many tons do they use?","110,000 ships in service now. Responsible for 2-3% carbon emissions. This tech can reduce it by up to 30%. Huge. Need to retrofit ports unless there is some design where the swing/fold out of the way during loading/unloading.","Talk about a slam dunk. I had no idea cargo ships used this much fuel but obviously we need them, and per the article each ship outfitted with this is a GHG savings similar to taking almost 500 cars off the road","Woah woah woah, we can use WIND to move our boats instead of fossil fuels? What a wild, new, new, TOTALLY BRAND NEW technology. Wind, hah! Who woulda thought? What will these kids make next?!","If only we knew about this before, which we did","Between the fuel used and the amount of plastics used to wrap the pallets being shipped, we absolutely need to revamp the shipping industry. This is a good start. Who was the Senator whose wife’s family owns a shipping company?","Does this mean “Big Shipping” has gone “woke?”","Wow a sail boat…..revolutionary 🥳","Hey guys sails are back on the menu!","Yeah but these paper straws are gonna really reduce pollution guys","This will make shipping cheaper, right?","Mandatory start-stop ?","Also a handy sniper nest for pirates.","I’m assuming they can fold down in a storm. But how do they get them to have a low enough profile to not cause a problem?","Who would’ve thought you could use the wind to sail the seas? These are truly amazing times we’re in","Now this is a great combination of old school and new tech...","I wonder how it compares to Seawings. Similar idea but seems a bit less trouble when it comes to docking in port. https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/giant-kite-sails-21528-ton-ship-atlantic-ocean","As someone who knows very little about the science behind these things...isn't that just a sail? Like, the thing boats have been using for thousands of years?","Sail > Windwing","That’s wild.","Technology is cyclical, Liz.","When the ocean rocks, that shits gonna snap","So they reinvented sails??","We’ve come full fucking circle","Propeller salesmen hate this one weird trick","I have an idea to save a lot more fuel than that, but it is considered highly controversial. How about we start manufacturing all that shit in those containers ourselves, right here in America?!","Just wondering about the \"hidden\" costs:Energy/pollution to manufacture the wingDowntime to installCost of installationRecurring costs of required maintenanceIncrease of insurance premiums for new \"at risk\" componentsCost (dollars/energy/pollution) of upgrades to ports to accommodate taller structuresInability to serve some ports because they can't/won't upgradeLost petro jobs:)","[deleted]"],"points":392}]
