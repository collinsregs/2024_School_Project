As for the local computer shop I would tread cautiously when they are talking about board level repairs as replacing chips/resistors and all other small board components is a challenging and time consuming task and will not guarantee they fix the issue as they probably don't know until they start replacing if the fault is fixed. Board level repairs are usually there when all other options are exhausted and the device is a must to be restored. I would try find some tech repair company that will look into component level repairs such as swapping out like for like the suspect parts. Unfortunately I believe apple in recent years now sticks ID chips on parts to marriage with the device it comes from (if this is the case then the only work around is to remove the id chip from old and install onto the replacement usually by means of desolder and solder by expensive equipment probably what the guy is quoting to do). Apple repairs can suck.","Check out Louis Rossmann on YouTube. He shows how to do things. Plus also has a Repair company.https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCl2mFZoRqjw_ELax4Yisf6w","Hey, repairs do not come in cheap. Obviously getting it repaired by Apple would be the best route IF you are made out of money but this is not the case. Now check reviews on the repair guy (if there are any) and check if he has built up a good reputation. Also I assume that part of the price is for buying said part to replace and do note that he runs a business so he has to make money on his end. Now if he is buying Apple certified replacement parts I heard that they do not treat third parties very well and the part will be more expensive. Back on topic, you also have to account for the time and labor that the repair guy puts in to fixing your laptop and the level of knowledge and skill that it takes to repair a laptop. Macbooks especially are designed by Apple to make it harder to repair and one wrong move and the repair guy may lose a couple months paycheck. With all this in mind the decision is all up to you. Take to Apple for $600 or the repair guy for $250. I guess you have the option to shop around more to check out other places but I would personally take my Macbook to repair guy.","Why does everyone assume that some company performing a service to speciality repair a very expensive bit of equipment is “Ripping them off”.Go and set up your own electronics business, charge less than the “Rip-offs” and you will have an amazing business with perfect customer satisfaction.

So if the original image has more than 256 colors, there will be a reduction in visual quality in the GIF output due to missing colors. GIF files, due to their use of lossless compression, can also be larger than WebM or WebP files using lossy compression. One advantage of GIF files is that you can specify how long each animation frame will be displayed for, so you can have pauses in the animation without data/frames needing to be encoded for that time. GIFs also support a 1-bit alpha channel for marking certain pixels/regions as transparent (invisible).WebM is optimized for audio/video content with lossy compression. It acts as a container for storing video encoded in VP8, VP9, or AV1 formats and (optionally) audio in Vorbis or Opus formats. WebM supports a full range of colors (unlike GIF), but there may be a slight reduction in visual quality compared to GIF particularly when representing images/animations with fewer than 257 colors. It is possible to achieve smaller file sizes with WebM compared to GIF, but the frame rate is constant, so if your animation has long pauses (for example) then some data still needs to be encoded for each paused frame. There is no native/universal support for an alpha (transparency) channel with WebM, but there are technical workarounds to achieve alpha transparency (if the player knows how to properly process the data stream).WebP is optimized for full color images and animations with either lossy or lossless compression. Unlike WebM, WebP does not support audio or timeline scrubbing, but it does have a native 8-bit alpha channel to support transparency (for each pixel you can control how transparent/translucent it should be, i.e. how visible background content should be through that pixel). Compared to GIF animations, WebP animations are usually much smaller in file size, even when using lossless compression. WebP also tends to produce smaller file sizes than WebM for most animations. WebP is not as universally supported as GIF, so some software may be able to open/display GIFs but not WebP animations. Compared to WebM, WebP has greater compatibility with photo/image editing programs (WebM files are really only designed be opened in video players/editors)."],"points":0},{"text":["my laptop constantly uninstalls it's wifi driver","Faulty wifi card, request repair or RMA under warranty."],"points":1},{"text":["Weird Screen Occurrence"],"points":0},{"text":["My Pc can not connect to the DNS server, and a manually entered DNS don’t work either.","You might want to mention what OS you're running."],"points":0},{"text":["HTTPS Self Assigned Certs that are untrusted/verified, are they the same or better than HTTP?","AFAIK HTTPS certificates serve two purposes, encryption and authentication. In your case, you would lose the authentication because the hostname in the certificate doesn't match your server, but the traffic would still be encrypted. So overall, HTTPS with a self signed certificate should be more secure than HTTPS.","You have to say yes here. Because at least \"someone\" can't see the traffic outright.But it is a problem. Not just for encryption, but perhaps mainly for being sure who you are communicating with","A self-signed certificate will encrypt traffic in transit, not just leave it in plain text. So in that regard only, it's more secure to use a self-signed cert than to use plain HTTP.The benefit you see with a pre-trusted certificate is that someone somewhere is creating a \"chain of trust\" that means you're not only using encrypted communications to talk to a site, but you can be fairly certain the site is who they say they are. With a self-signed certificate, that's pushed to the end user to make the calls about origin authenticity, and 99.999% of people don't know how to check that thoroughly and 75% of that .001% is probably not going to check.That \"chain of trust\" is you trusting your OS or browser manufacturer, who trusts a Certificate Authority (CA), who went through some process to confirm that the certificate requestor is also the entity who's publicly recognized as the rightful owner of the site. It is possible to change this chain of trust to include \"your IT department created their own CA and issues certificates internally, and told all company computers to trust certificates they've issued\", that that comes with it's own challenges and vulnerabilities.","As someone else has mentioned, the certificate in HTTPS provides both authentication and encryption. So let's make a comparison.In http, you get a letter which says it's from your friend John, you write a letter back. You have no idea if it's actually from John, and anyone who picks up the letter can read it.In HTTPS with a self signed cert, you receive a letter that says it's from John. It's written in code that you've previously received instructions to decrypt. You encrypt your reply and write him an encrypted letter. You still have no idea if it's actually from John, but at least anyone who picks up the letter can't read it. You can search up \"SSL Handshake\" to get a better idea of how the encryption is set up.In a proper HTTPS setup, you get the encrypted letter and a chain of proofs which leads to a source you trust that the sender is John. Now you can be fairly certain that the sender is indeed John, and that no one else can read your messages.Historically, HTTP was faster than HTTPS and so some sites would still stick with HTTP. However, updates to HTTPS have made the time difference negligible, and sometimes even faster (since HTTP didn't get the update). It does add more setup and points of failure to a system, so some dark networks may choose to use HTTP for their internal communication, but generally speaking you should be using HTTPS.If you're using a certificate with the wrong name, you can have issues such as a browser warning, or perhaps being blocked by firewalls or other preventative systems. If it is indeed self signed, then you can just generate a new certificate and be done with it (although there will still be a browser warning for self signed certs)."],"points":2},{"text":["Think i got a virus","If you suspect you may have malware on your computer, or are trying to remove malware from your computer, please see our malware guidePlease ignore this message if the advice is not relevant.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If the router enforces them, and it applies controls to a device with a particular IP address, then the device can be configured to manually acquire a different IP address, bypassing the assigned address and thus the controls.Any suggestions for more secure or effective methods to enforce these controls.Use a more advanced network gateway that applies the parental controls to all devices on the network, except for specific allowed devices. That exception can be applied based on IP address or MAC address (easier), or logins or client keys (more difficult to manage). This is more secure than targeting the controls to a specific device, because no matter how you apply the restriction there is usually some way to make the device look like a different device that won't be subject to the restrictions.Then, you physically confiscate any SIM card or other means of accessing internet outside of the protected WiFi network.You can also use parental control software that restricts access to certain websites, but this is less reliable than blocking it at the network level. The one thing you have to understand in cybersecurity is, if you have unsupervised physical access to the device, you control the device, it cannot be trusted.General advice on dealing with similar situations where a client might be technically adept at bypassing network restrictions.Don't 100% rely on technology.

Apple and a few others use it because HEIC produces smaller files for the same quality. If you would convert your whole collection to JPG, please be mindful of the fact the files will be larger and likely will lose some details after conversion. If you happen to try to keep your files the same size as they are now, your are losing quality (whether you can actually notice the difference easily is another matter, though).One idea is to switch to better image viewing software (like XnView MP) for good and convert the files as-needed or create small thumbnails for comfortable viewing while keeping your HEIC files as the \"originals.\" If you would convert everything, please remember you're going to need up to 40% more storage space for your photos (if you plan to keep them) and even then you're likely still losing data, especially color information (your files won't lose all color or anything, but you'll lose things that are hard to notice at a glance).Although not ideal, HEIC is decades newer and easily technically superior to JPG.

Where you get compatibility issues is if it's a different chipset (Not to be confused with motherboard chipset) and/or manufacturer of the RAM. The brand on the RAM doesn't make the sticks (Except for a few). All RAM chips and chipsets are made by SK Hynix, Samsung, Nanya or Micron/Spectec. The only ones I know of that sell memory directly is Samsung and Micron semi does it through Crucial.Matching the integrated stick is basically not going to happen so you just try a stick and cross your fingers.
