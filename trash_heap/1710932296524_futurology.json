Fun thought, but I think you should look into the limits of language and logic. And incomputability.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_reasonerA semantic reasoner, reasoning engine, rules engine, or simply a reasoner, is a piece of software able to infer logical consequences from a set of asserted facts or axioms. The notion of a semantic reasoner generalizes that of an inference engine, by providing a richer set of mechanisms to work with. The inference rules are commonly specified by means of an ontology language, and often a description logic language. Many reasoners use first-order predicate logic to perform reasoning; inference commonly proceeds by forward chaining and backward chaining.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_LanguageThe Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a family of knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies. Ontologies are a formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects.Ontologies resemble class hierarchies in object-oriented programming but there are several critical differences. Class hierarchies are meant to represent structures used in source code that evolve fairly slowly (perhaps with monthly revisions) whereas ontologies are meant to represent information on the Internet and are expected to be evolving almost constantly. Similarly, ontologies are typically far more flexible as they are meant to represent information on the Internet coming from all sorts of heterogeneous data sources. Class hierarchies on the other hand tend to be fairly static and rely on far less diverse and more structured sources of data such as corporate databases.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)RDF represents information using semantic triples, which comprise a subject, predicate, and object. Each item in the triple is expressed as a Web URI. Turtle provides a way to group three URIs to make a triple, and provides ways to abbreviate such information, for example by factoring out common portions of URIs. For example, information about Huckleberry Finn could be expressed as:http://example.org/person/Mark_Twainhttp://example.org/relation/authorhttp://example.org/books/Huckleberry_Finn .","Intrinsic about our universe is the existence and stability of objects. Meaning 1+1=2 which gives you natural numbers, which gives you rational numbers, which gives you complex numbers which gives you group theory and what not, which gives you the standard model.It is also a three dimensional Euclidian space. Which gives us 2D and 3D Euclidean geometry. So together with numbers that gives us ND spaces and there you have your string theory.Everything else: intelligence, complexity, information, computation. emergent properties is human interpretation."],"points":8},{"text":["When do you think are we going to have like 15 percent and more unemployment rate in USA and Europe because of AI and automation?","I think the reality is much, much more complicated than this.First of all, we should not overstate the current capabilities of AI and automation. Just because LLMs are currently progressing pretty well doesn't mean they're not going to hit a wall at some point in the near future beyond which improvement will be slow until a new method is found to speed it up again. Stuff like that.Secondly, this misunderstands how the economy actually works. There aren't a set number of jobs in the economy and that's it. The amount of jobs available in an economy can change. If AI takes 15% of the current types of jobs, that doesn't mean a 15% jobless rate. Because AI will likely significantly lower the price of production. Will in return either increase profits or decrease the cost of goods or both. In return there will be more money in circulation that people can spend on other goods and services, including in sectors where there is not as big of a role of AI. In addition, AI needs stuff to run as well. Maintainence, developers, even people at power plants generating the power to run them. More AI usage indirectly means more of these jobs are required too.The TLDR here being: AI taking 15% of jobs would almost certainly not mean a 15% unemployment rate, but rather people doing different kinds of jobs than before.Until the day that AI can basically do every single job, there is no legitimate fear of massive job loss beyond just a lack of training and retraining in the proper fields. That is a genuine concern but in theory quite solveable.Thirdly, theoretical demand (without directly taking into account money in circulation) is basically infinite, it's supply that's always constrained. More automation means more supply (theoretically) which is basically an unambiguously good thing. Fewer people doing more work means more wealth for the same number of people. The problem comes in only when you have a problem with wealth distribution. Here I do think UBI would be quite helpful, but so would many other policies like a wealth tax, or a breaking apart monopolies, or an AI tax, etc.","I think because of how unemployment is calculated we'll probably just end up with 'lower workforce participation' over time due to discouraged workers and folks gig economying it up. The U3 numbers aren't really designed to climb that high, people start hitting U6 criteria before they do.","Lets see what's happening in 20 years. If the industrial revolution didn't destroy the labor market, I'm unconvinced AI will either.","Never because automation is not a factor for increasing unemployment, that's just not how it works. Industrial revolution started quite some time ago in 1760ies or thereabouts, we sort of know how it works and what sort of effect it has and how it relates to unemployment - it doesn't.Unemployment is down to how economy in general is doing. When it's contraction phase then companies have to tighten belt, get rid of employees that are not being profitable and unemployment goes up. When it's boomtimes, then focus is on growth, do more of the same profitable stuff as fast as possible, hire whoever you need to hire to make it happen, unemployment goes down.","Never. It will be people choosing not to work and others choosing to work fewer hours.There will be a drop in the percent of the population in the workforce.","It will hit foregin jobs first. A company that outsources labor can now just do it in house with AI. I can image some regions suddenly losing huge job numbers.It is going to grow like spores in different industries.

Secretaries and coders are going to start wandering the streets because they are clearly incapable of solving new problems.","Unemployment is a result of supply and demand for labor not meeting eachother. AI isn‚Äôt sending us to high unemployment. Perhaps it‚Äôs going to reduce the workforce (labor force participation), but unemployment is a different thing.Specifically, unemployment falls into three categories.

At least in Europe I think that people will be given more paid parental leave, more sick leave, longer education and shorter work hours etc so the jobs that are still needed can be shared and at the same time as we share the increased amounts of goods and services these fewer working hours produce with the help of AI. America is more stuck in ideological trenches which might make the political adaptation to this new paradigm harder.","Never. That‚Äôs not how innovation works.Jobs that exist today will disappear.

If this is a fact, there is little motivation to substitute sodium.Lithium makes up a very small portion of EV battery cells by weight and even less by cost. So unless the supply is highly constrained it makes no sense to replace it. At this time, the price of lithium has returned to where it was before the bubble and production has increased massively with the stabilized price.For stationary use applications like grid storage, iron redox flow batteries are easily the winner as their electrolytes, anodes and cathodes can be replaced without recyling the battery and in addition to being non-toxic and non-scarce, they are far cheaper than sodium ion can ever be and work at gigawatt scales effectively with no thermal management problems.So the chance of sodium gaining much traction in the next few decades is very unlikely. Lithium transportation batteries will become cheaper and cheaper and iron flow batteries will replace old coal and natural gas installations for stationary power storage and industrial power.","Petroleum has a higher energy density than any battery"],"points":121},{"text":["Is it ethical to try to create actual artificial intelligence?","Is it ethical to conceive a baby without its consent when you have a predisposition for genetic diseases?","Your analogy is not valid.There is no reason to think the AI would be in incomprehensible agony - if it was then yes it would be unethical.

Most would say it is absurd for even asking this question.However if you think from a ruthless capitalist - i.e your life only has value if you contribute to other people's lives by being productive, then the answer seems like a yes.Suppose we twist - we never kill but we put those humans in an equivalent happy prison, away from rest of productive society.We use pesticides equivalent to lakes wiping a large number of species from planet. Why? Because no value to humans. We wipe forests to make way for our again.We value productive citizens and most countries go to lengths to ban immigration. Criminals are housed in prisons away from society.If AI can replace billions of workers, those workers have no productive value. In a capitalist society, those workers will live in poverty. Perhaps a less painful avenue is more favorable.I am sure in a future, an AI will the question but in a different frame - Is it ethical to kill all non-productive humans?

How so?There's a lot of Helium-3 on the lunar surface.Helium-3 is an isotope used for nuclear fusion and while extremely scarce on Earth, it is plentiful on the Moon, created by the solar wind emitted from the Sun. 2 days agoHelium-3 Fusion cycleNow for a bit of speculation. With the current approach to Fusion energy, helium-3 isn't the \"fuel of choice\". I think this is because using the current approach (brute force pressure and temperature) requires too much energy input.But let's say you had a helium-3 rich plasma. The main factor determining the threshold for fusion is the Coulomb force that causes the + charged He-3 nuclei from getting close enough to fuse to each other.If there was a way to increase the concentration of negative charge, you would see an increase in the concentration of +'ive nuclei via charge cancellation.You might be able to increase the concentration of -'ve charge by using an electron beam.Here's a diagram showing how it might work.Instead of a vaccum chamber with \"base material\" you'd have a plasma chamber that was full of positively charged He-3 nuclei. The introduction of the electron beam draws the He-3 nuclei closer together (via charge cancellation).Instead of expending large amounts of energy on higher temps, higher pressures, magnetic confinement etc. you'd be expending (probably) a much smaller amount of energy on your electron beam.The strength of the beam (ie. concentration of electrons and rate of electron \"delivery\" into the He-3 plasma) would determine the rate of the fusion reaction... if the process works.Once your reactor is up and running, some of the power generated by the fusion reaction would go to running the electron beam.You could control (or tune) the reaction rate by controlling the strength of the beam.If you really wanted to take this idea further?You could use star types as a way of categorizing power levels. How so?Red (or Red Dwarf) would represent a low reaction rate. Quite possibly the one with the highest efficiency level.Orange, yellow etc. up to blue would then represent higher and more energetic reaction rates. Perhaps less efficient as well.tldr; If He-3 Fusion is possible (and we know there's lots of it on the Moon) this might explain the recent interest in going back and \"setting up shop\".","I'm hoping we get to see the first opening of CHUNKS on Luna.","Could a new news story about this be the sequel to \"Foot Heads Arms Body\"?","Helium 3.
