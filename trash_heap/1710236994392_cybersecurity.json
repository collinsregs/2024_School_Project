This is a very US thing, though.","\"Machine in the middle\" is what I tend to use, as it's more precise and keeps the MITM acronym so it's highly recognizable. I haven't heard On-Path, but eh, it's reasonably clear from context clues. I doubt professionals would have trouble with black-box/white-box vs closed-box/open-box or similar.For context, I also teach, and I would differ from your professor in that I'm not going to tell you that a specific term is \"phased out\" because that's not how language works. Language is a tool for communication, there is no standardization body for \"how people communicate,\" and language around the world is constantly evolving. Case in point, I have no idea what a \"rizzler\" or \"gyatt\" (sp?) is and I don't really care to find out, but both are likely new terms for existing concepts that are preferred by a specific social group.As long as we're both understanding each other & comfortable within our dialogue, then we're cool. If your professor is requesting to use specific terminology, then you should likely use it in your class to ensure clear communication between yourself, professor, and other students - but don't be surprised if you hear other terms around whether \"phased out\" or new phrases or what-have-you.Personally, I use non-gendered/non-colored terms by default when I teach, but I describe what people might recognize - ex. my slides are titled \"machine in the middle\" but I'll include other recognized terms like \"man in the middle\" or \"packet sniffing\" to ensure anyone who's heard other terms ties their existing knowledge to the course material. It takes no effort on my end, and I've yet to hear any complaints or notice any drop in exam scores, so it seems like everyone's communicating just fine.","How long did it take for developers to get over the master branch in git being renamed to main?

Probably soon you‚Äôll need AI tools on defense as humans would react too slowly.Patching windows will shrink even more.","AI is both a tool and a threat, but not in the way most companies leverage it. I see so many companies saying \"we use AI to keep you safe\" but it's the same crap from 12 years ago that didn't keep anyone safe then and sure as hell does not keep them safe now.Some companies have started to use more advanced forms of AI in hopes to stave off the AI vs AI battlefield which I see CISOs saying \"it's coming!\" when in reality, it's already here but they are so removed from the day to day of the threat landscape they are basically clueless.Many think AI is going to replace everyone, in fact it's going to create opportunities as someone needs to validate the automation isn't being fed incorrect data and thus piping out hot garbage that people think is gospel.My past 8 years or so working with the most advanced forms of endpoints security leveraging true next-gen AI (not machine learning) has shown me there is definitely hope but far too many are fearful of adopting or just plain cannot understand it and therefore steer away from it.‚ÄãTL;DRAI is both good and bad and will require humans to validate what the AI is being \"fed\" during it's training. The AI vs AI war is thoroughly fun to be a part of though and it's the best part of my day throwing AI generated variants against programs to see how they handle these threats!","I can have it create a very effective and damaging worm and not write a single line of code.","It's actually surprisingly bad at cybersecurity so far.The literature shows a less than human ability to identify and explain secure code failures in particular, and penetration testing efforts have been less than impressive in arbitrary environment. Sorry, I don't have the reference, but there are some out there to be found.My take is, legal side will be replaced most quickly, some areas of lower level RM, and eventually SecOps - starting with Prevention - self-optimising NFW, WAF, traffic inspection, informing and automatically updating, or scheduling updates, for solo human operators to prod.Then Detection after, of outliers, anomolies, SIEM initial triage, etc. Feeding into the same cycle. Finally Response - taking outlier and live data to perform Identification, Containment steps, and with generalised AI it could go much further.So, if you want to be \"AI safe\" in your career, focus on those aspects which it is not showing much of a talent for, and ensure you can talk about ML such that you get put into the \"can help us make ML work for us\" category and not the \"Can be replaced by ML\" category at work.Its going to be good at DF (but not excellent, further pushing DF toward an expert only market), bad at GRC beyond scoping and gap analysis perhaps.

Continuing on the quantum front, quantum computing will render all of our existing encryption algorithms obsolete. New algorithms that are ‚Äúpost-quantum‚Äù are in review and should be approved for widespread use later this year. 4). AI offers both security threats and benefits. On the benefit front, AI will enable us to identify threats faster and automate responses to common threats, allowing us to reposition security talent to higher value activities. 5) on the same note, AI is also going to empower bad actors.

Also, an associates really will only help you get into the most basic entry level jobs like helpdesk or desktop support, as they generally don't carry enough weight without experience for system admin's or network admin type of work.","most companies want to see a bachelors these days, especially if you don‚Äôt have experience.

Hiring managers will want someone who can practice their skills and learn quickly, and it's best to find a way to develop a portfolio of sorts to show that you can do the work.","You are young!!!!

You are decades ahead of some people getting into this field.","Don't limit yourself to GRC, or tech support. Depending on your goals a software engineering/ ops gig could be hugely beneficial.","I got my AAS in Information Assurance and Cybersecurity from a local community college in Maryland. Spoke to my advisor and found out they had a 2+2 program with a local university in IT. So I was able to transfer 64 credits to that university and get my BS in IT. I was 24 when I graduated because I started college right around 20.Keep in mind, I did not finish highschool. I had a below 1.0 gpa basically the entire time I was in highschool. Just never went or cared, so I legitimately had to teach myself how to learn and take notes during the entire first year or two of college. Had to learn math from scratch. Had to learn how to write papers from scratch. All that stuff. It was challenging as fuck but I put the hours and effort in and learned a ton in my time at college. Sat in the front of every class and went to office hours and study sessions whenever I could. I am by no means the smartest guy in every room.I bartended on weekends while in school and had a regular patron who worked in the hosting industry (lots of web servers and databases). We became friends over a 2 year period, and I eventually asked him to mentor me; which he accepted. He had me work on some projects, and we would hangout and have beers and play guitar and shit from time to time.I was in my last year of school so he eventually asked me if I was interested in an internship (of course I was). I worked as an IT intern for about 6 months before they hired me on as a full time sysadmin. Worked as a sysadmin for a year and legit just kept asking if I could help with more advanced stuff. Eventually I shifted into a systems / linux engineering role where I was migrating, securing, patching, and automating system and network infrastructure for all kinds of clients.Ended up getting the go-ahead to work as a 'digital nomad' for about 6 months before getting laid off from that job (best thing to ever happen to me). Then worked varying contracts while traveling around eastern europe for about 4 months. Mostly Ansible and Linux related work. Some quick contracts to keep me from day drinking too often lolRecently moved back to the states and found a sick Security Engineering job for an MSSP and I'm loving it. Love the work I'm doing here and the people I work with. Most stress free I've ever been and since it's a small company, my opinions are definitely taken seriously by management. Nobody is breathing down my neck all day or anything like that. It's great.Anyway...I would say college is what you make of it. Your degree doesn't mean shit if you do the bare minimum and are just going to get a piece of paper and leave. I loved college and took advantage of all the opportunities that were presented to me there. Made lots of friends as well.If you are persistent and ambitious when setting and achieving your goals, you can get into the cybersecurity field without a degree. In my opinion, I would go the help desk / sysadmin or junior dev route to get your foot in the door though. It's unlikely you'll get security role without some foundational work experience these days.Also, ignore all this \"wahhh it's so hard to find a job\" nonsense going around the tech community right now... there is opportunity everywhere. If you can solve problems, are personable, and can sell yourself well, you will find work. Basically, what makes you stand out from the other 100+ candidates? Nobody wants to pay a guy good money who's just like everybody else.","I got an associates for support tech at 26, did that for a few years and moved in to entry level soc, you'll be fine. As others are stating, get certs. Have continued passion for learning and learn on your own. I'm now a threat intelligence and incident response analyst III.","I am in the same boat. I am getting my associates in IT. I don't know where to go from there. I want to get my foot in the door i'm 22 years old.","I‚Äôm getting a AAS in cyber security.

I started with an AAS in Informatics. From there I got a part time help desk job at a school. I bounced to another school for full time sysadmin and now a security engineer.The AAS is great to start, but understand this field isn‚Äôt the type where you get a degree and you‚Äôre off. I worked hard for certs, built my resume/linkedin, did independent study and labbing etc. You will be studying forever so long as you wish to progress.","I started CC at age 21. I did not feel old at all and you shouldn't either. Plenty of students were around my age or older.I would say start looking for some entry level help desk jobs or internships asap, don't wait until you finish. Also, start working towards certifications asap as well. Just don't wait until you finish your two year degree to start doing everything.Good luck!","Also in a GRC role. Transitioned into that on the power of my AS in IT and a Security and Administration background, and a Security Clearance. A lot of the 20-somethings I work with have maybe a Bachelors in a relevant field. A Sec+ (or one of a set of other less common certs) is needed to advance, but not to start. Having the Sec+ would give a leg up. A few years ago, anything computer related wanted you to to talk about what you were doing with your \"home lab\". If you can, maybe spin up a small domain of virtual machines to putz around with.","Too old? Lmao!","Community college or an applied associate's is a great way to start.

However, since you are in school, I highly highly recommend getting a cyber internship. This is big as you can get experience and work with different teams for exposure. Also, with enough time, you will most likely get a full time offer. Also, do not just do your school work. Aim and get certifications. By the end of two years, you can get experience with an internship in the field and certifications along with it.","Too old... I started IT professionally when I was 26.

I was doing this exact thing in 2019, and I was 27. You're not too old. However, don't let anyone fool you. You will only be qualified for low-end help desk jobs and aren't going to get an entry-level cybersec job because there isn't really such a thing. I had an AAS in IT with an emphasis in info systems and cybersec. I got hired to be a desktop support tech and do help desk stuff, too. Six months later, our company was bought by a bigger one, and I got more than a 20k pay bump to do just help desk work and got a mid tier position because of my desktop experience. I settled in, and with another 8ish months of working my ass off, I was top 3 in the help desk in most statistical categories my company cares about. I got a promotion after another 6ish months and a good pay bump. Now I'm the highest position on help desk that isn't a supervisor. I'm paid well and specialized in an area that allows me some freedom to help other IT departments within the company. Here's the kicker. I've been in IT for almost 3 years, and I realized I don't really even want to be in information security anymore. IT is such a diverse field, it's very likely that after spending a few years in it, you'll find something you'd rather be doing. Good luck, man, don't stress. It'll work out eventually.","I started my associates as soon as i turned 21 as well, and literally my first semester i was able to get a helpdesk internship which led me into a permanent part time employee at the company and now I am able to cross train and learn some things from our cyber security team and also learned a couple things from our network admins , i think helpdesk is a really good place to start and most dont require any certs they just need you to be motivated and also able to have good people skills","I went to college.

So cost centers are always underfunded and under prioritized.That is until the day, you get breached or ransomed.

Security experience is information security experience.The over saturation is in credentialed no experience. Those folks need to go work as help desk, sys admins, entry level devs, or QA. Generally anything entry level where you get exposure to standards and tech.The reason is school and boot camps are being pushed hard. Generating folks with high expectations and no experience.I‚Äôd say three years ago those folks got hired asap because most people didn‚Äôt have proper credentials pre pandemic. So getting a cissp was a big thing even with folks with experience.Now that things are cooling off and people are being laid off, where there is an opening- organizations are looking for certain things to further qualify candidates. So no, it‚Äôs not fully over saturated. It‚Äôs just over saturated with folks with no experience.","Was a contractor at BT and slowly becoming deskilled, could not get a gig with any of the big names.Took a huge paycut to work for a tiny pentesting company to get back in the game (80ish > 26k). Got back up to speed.Never really been one for certs, just relied on experience, but did put the graft in to get GXPN.Now director of a small cyber sec startup outfit. Earnings are tiny again, all my savings gone. Slowly starting to make a bit of headway. Hopefully will turn out ok!","Maybe it‚Äôs time for us to switch to cyber offensive.(I‚Äôm kidding before anyone loses it)","Just a quick reminder to everyone reading this.You absolutely do not need a degree to work in this field. Do not let others, recruiters, and or HR people gatekeep this field.I do not have a degree and I was able to get a job as a Security Analyst, went into Incident Response, and now have a cushy high paying Security Engineering job.It is definitely not an easy gold rush field where you come in and get a shit ton of money and end up in a cushy job fast. You will have to give it 110%, earn certs and fill out a whole lot of applications in an insane job market, but it is possible.As others say a degree can help or maybe put you up higher in the hiring pool but it comes down to your skillset, not JUST getting and or having a degree.","Job security is better than a nun's","Don‚Äôt focus on cyber security. Focus on digital forensics as a whole then cyber. Easier to get into a firm or company when you can do both. Most forensic examiners can do both cyber and deadbox. Ask a cyber guy to do forensics on a cell phone they will probably forget a chain of custody and all the very basic things. That will get them hemmed up in a litigation case.","No. The answer to your \"Is the cybersecurity field genuinely oversaturated\" is NO.Too many people applying for a job is not a thing I care about. Too many \"GOOD-FITS\" applying for a job is something I'd care about and call oversaturation. There are FAR too many not good fits. People who just don't know enough, have enough experience, or just don't fit well enough into the current team to warrant further pursuit.It's exactly like dating. It fucking sucks.","I was back in school (nearly a decade ago) and studying again because I enjoy cybersecurity. My criminal record made finding a job I felt was worth the stress and the payment nearly impossible. I had a bunch of life events come up and then moved and didn‚Äôt finish school for the umpteenth time. I personally have always been super into infosec since I was a kid. I see it all the time the people that are there for the money never stay they burn out and grow to hate it. The people that actually have a passion and a love for it have a hard time because of stupid barriers to entry. I was considering finishing my degree but honestly it looks more profitable to just become a cyber criminal and my freedom is more important to me than money. So for now I‚Äôll stick to farming and taking it easy as much as I‚Äôd love to work in the cybersecurity field it seems to be misunderstood and always has been. Companies don‚Äôt understand the importance until everyone learns that OpSec is their job too these large corporations will always be playing catch up.","Lol I‚Äôm literally sitting here setting up a VM to do an active directory lab trying to learn and remain hopeful someone will take a chance on a newbie. One of the things that drew me to IT from education was that fact that learning new things and developing new skills can put you in a position to earn more money. As a teacher I would research and research best practice and implement what I learned in the classroom, and get good results but my salary has barely went up the last 10 years. I think two things can be true at once. People can want to get into the field for the earning potential primarily and have a desire/will to learn. I‚Äôm a year into studying 4-8 hours a day while teaching full time with a wife and kids and actually loving the journey (haven‚Äôt started applying yet). Yet if there was no earning potential I would have definitely chose something different as I followed pure passion for almost 15 years in education and see that is not always the way. It‚Äôs funny what I hear from a lot of the cyber veterans is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do this if money is the driving factor‚Äù is what I would hear in education for so long and now you have a bunch of burnt out teachers waiting on a pay day that will never come no matter how well you master your job. I think it‚Äôs always a balance between doing it for the money and the love of the craft, in education I see a lot of teachers who have degrees in art or music and they can‚Äôt really do anything else but teach and they regret it. With that being said I do understand that in order for me to get a job I have to learn and out in time because I‚Äôm competing with the 20 year old kid who has spent 10 hours a day building computers since he was 5 years old Lol. So I don‚Äôt take days off of studying but it‚Äôs not just the love of learning that driving it‚Äôs definitely the thought that eventually my hard work will pay off.","Personally, I believe that while there is a growing demand for professionals in this field due to the increase in cyber threats, there are also challenges such as competition in the job market and the need to keep up to date with the latest security technologies and techniques. I think the key is to keep constantly updated.","I think AI will play a critical role as humans can't do it all at the same time and mid size companies doent have the budget","I‚Äôm pretty fed up with it. I moved onto non-cyber pastures after 3 years of education and months and months trying to get into the industry at any level higher than entry level. I even did an internships where I got certified in Fortinet and became very familiar with Fortigate. Did anyone give a shit? No.Screw my education. Screw my 7 years of IT experience. Screw my leadership experience. Fuck my Net+, Sec+, and CASP+ certifications. They don‚Äôt want you, and if they do, they want you for 40k a year. Bullshit, all of it. Infuriating.I wasted a lot of money and effort on that degree. And all I got for it was a middle management position paying me too little for the job thanks to my age. And I‚Äôm one of the lucky ones.","Won‚Äôt artificial intelligent computers be able to brew into systems better than any human can stop them. I see an arms race between AIs hacking and AIs protecting. But serious, will AI have the ability to become the best hacker ever? Will nothing be safe anymore?","My two cents is that if you have skills that are transferable, you'll be useful as long as you're not replaceable by AI.If you can do dev and understand security concepts, you can fit into any number of roles. If you just know web app pen testing, you might find that when security funding gets squeezed, you find it hard to get employment","I've not read the other 91 comments, but generally I feel very optimistic. It's an exciting time to work in cybersecurity.Context: every large organisation has a cyber security security capability (whether it's an individual or a team of 100). The interesting thing about this industry, is that organisations across industries massively vary in maturity. You can work on cutting edge tech, researching the application of LLMs to security defense, or you can work for a massive global organisation that is living in the past and needs to undergo huge transformations - you'll be able to do everything from scratch. There's lots of opportunity and the industry isn't going anywhere.Six figure promises: this really bothers me and has gotten out of hand. But, that's not to say it's not attainable if you focus on skills development, getting the right experience, you'll certainly be on the path (location dependent). I wrote an in depth article on this via my newsletter - link in bio.Market conditions: 2023/24 has been really tough for security. Layoffs, budget cuts, hiring freezes etc. I hope we see a reversal towards the end of the year and teams get the resources they need.Skills shortage: there is demand, it's just not for entry level people that need a lot of time and energy to train and get them up to speed. Companies want experienced, battle ready pros that will hit the ground running (catch-22 - if we don't get more people in the space, this shortage isn't going anywhere!)Opportunity: this space is there for the taking. You're absolutely right when you reference different methods - 50% of jobs don't make it to job boards, it's through referrals and recruiters. How do you get these opps? Build an online presence/personal brand around your area of expertise - that's your differentiator in the market place.","I honestly think it‚Äôs going to get broader in terms of the types of jobs you can get in the industry. Anything from Law to Policy to Psychology to Traditional positions.Basically the stereotype of the SOC analyst or a Bug Hunter is just the start.","Lots of so-called security experts, but a massive lack of talent and vision.","Bleak. Very very bleak. Everyone wants into Cybersecurity because it sounds sexy and movies and tv shows make it sound all cool and sexy but when you get into people realize what a shitshowingly boring it can be (or should). And then you begin to realize that corporations truly don't care, they put up a good face and say the right things, and do what is mandated. But as soon as you start making changes to protect the organization as soon as you start trying to spend the money that needs to be spent, you find out how \"important\" cybersecurity really is.","Its a field like any other IT. Some companies have more need for dev than server and networking, some have more need for cybersecurity and sales.","If it‚Äôs so saturated why do they keep leaking our shit!","I‚Äôm exhausted. So I‚Äôm moving on. But I‚Äôve been in the game a while. Moving to engineering. Yeah, I know, no peace there either, but I have a thick skin during reasonable business hours.","I feel really good about it. I'm so fortunate I'm in at 23. I feel good about my future.","The entry / intermediate level roles are completely saturated.There is demand for senior roles.","Bleak","I hope it has a future, because I've landed in it by accident and want to stay.","A notable challenge is that some businesses don't prioritize security, affecting both hiring and compensation in the field.This is only a problem for mediocre and bad talent. Good talent in this field is paid exceptionally well. New grad straight out of undergrad are paid more than the average doctor. I make more than the vast majority of doctors and I work from anywhere, including out of the country when I want to. All with a BS and no half million dollar medical school debt.The short answer is if you want good comp you have to be good talent, that's about it.","I think there are lots of CS professionals looking for jobs atm, and while there are plenty of companies that need them, hardly any of them realize this yet."],"points":703},{"text":["New OpenSecurityTraining2 class: \"Trusted Computing 1101: Introductory Trusted Platform Module (TPM) usage\" by Dimi Tomov of TPM.dev (~8 hours)","Topics include:* Use of TPM for digital signing and sealing secrets* Use of TPM for HMAC and hashing* Use of TPM as a secure storage* How to enable the TPM's protection against physical-bus Machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks* Protecting external data using a TPM* Understanding TPM internals and capabilitiesThis class takes students 8h21m on average to complete.","sweet. love you and your team's work :)"],"points":11},{"text":["cyber Security architecture","There is no such correct answer.
