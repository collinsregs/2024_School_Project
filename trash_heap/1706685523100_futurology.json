[{"text":["Android/replicants replacing us in the workforce","I know some IT guys do this. Not the android part, but the automation part. Any work that takes more than 10 minutes and has to be done repreatedly, they automate.Basically, the work they do is the automation of their own work.","Every worker that is replaced by a robot must get all the money from the job that that robot makes. I want a robot to do my job for me and not replace me. Otherwise society will collapse, and we will have WW3.","My opinion - it works similarly to how we use our capital resources now.We buy (or lease) a ‘robot’ to do work in our place that has value to someone (say it’s someone that wants to build a road). That someone pays us an agreed upon price for our labor. The price would need to cover wear and tear, but less than they could lease a robot for themselves.So we’d still see the public pooling of capital to accomplish things we can’t individually. Therefore corporations still exist.And we really don’t get ahead unless we accumulate lots of bots.We could always just have the bot run our own personal farm and be ‘self-sufficient’, but we’d need to replace our bot at some point.Farming today is already working with greater and greater using automation. Or cheap labor.See, it doesn’t really work out the way we think it would.Prices would reset like inflation, so that the return on our capital would be very lowIn many ways, it would be comparable to today - we would be trying to invest our way into a return that supports our lives. Try that today - it just doesn’t work well until you reach a certain level of capital accumulation.","We would need to find more work. Since only those who own the means of production have money then we would all be working in service industries around them."],"points":0},{"text":["When do you think we will have weapons that can destroy an entire planet in a few seconds?","We already have hydrogen bombs and the capacity to make them big enough to do this. AFAIK we can scale them well past planet destroyers if we needed to.","Let's fast track this. I'm tired of the Uranus jokes.","Already happened a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.","We'd need access to multiple planets' worth of fissile material, the ability to launch projectiles close to the speed of light, the ability to weaponize gravity, or the ability to make weapons out of antimatter or other exotic materials. Your timeline is whichever is likely to happen first.","The earth wouldn't be completely destroyed but the current nuclear weapons in a full max-casualty targetted mutually assured destruction scenario could certainly wipe out 75% of the worlds population in less than 45 minutes from the first missile launching. And in the following fallout and crisis and famine many more would die. While humanity wouldn't go extinct, it would go back to the stone age both technology wise and population wise.","We'll have destroyed us long before that. We already have weapons that can end all life on earth at any moment.","My guy with the number of nukes pointed everywhere if it came down to it we already have this ability.","I don't think it will happen until long after we become an interstellar species and there are multiple stellar-size nations.There is no reason to make such a weapon as it will also kill the person who launched it on earth, and everything they care about as well.From the middle point of the cold war, believe it or not, the actual yield of individual nukes stopped growing and started shrinking, and instead more, smaller warheads, and better targeting, allowing more targets, less collateral damage, with the mission being achieved with smaller bombs.No one wants to destroy the whole earth.","We can destroy most of the surface if we put the effort into it. Destroying an entire planet, like alderan style is a bit too much for us. Overcoming planetary binding energy is more than would be necessary to kill a planet though.","Nah, it'll be a lot longer than a few seconds until we have that","After the very moment that that capability is discovered, it will happen very fast.","Much quicker if we were at all motivated to go there. Look up the cold-war nuclear programs GNOMON & SUNDIAL. Decades ago there was research there was work into bombs that had 1000x the power of the biggest nuke the US ever fielded. SUNDIAL would't be a planet-cracker in it's own right, but I think you are an order of magnitude high. I would say 50-100 years \"optimistically\", and probably sub-250 in most cases.It also depends on what your definition of \"destroyed\" is. Render a earth type planet uninhabitable? might be doable now. Penetrate the crust and create a crack straight to the mantle? Give us a century of practice... Cause all the bits of the planet to achieve escape velocity, full-assed Death-star style? Now we are getting up there, probably need to be at least a 1 on the Kardashev scale, bump up to a K2 and you can definitely do it. (It would take about three days of the sun's total output stored up to do the deathstar laser thing to earth) That is a multi-century civilizational push there. That's when you have to slow down to keep your civilization running and you run up against massive timelines no matter how clever or united you are. Still, I think your time line is a bit pessimistic given the technological gains we've seen in the last hundred years.","What do you mean destroy?Blowing s planet up like in the movies is impossible. Gravity is way to strong.But! We can already destroy the world many times over with hydrogen if that's what you mean. Or we can use a biological weapon to destroy Earth's population.","A few seconds? Never, you'll sterilize the surface in a moment, but the big ball of rock and lava, that'll take days to ablate.","We can make bombs 100 thousand times more powerful than at Hiroshima, 1 gigaton of TNT... Its enough to do a crater or trigger supervolcano chamberd maybe. We can snowball the world for a while. To destroy the world you need an internal orbiting BH. If a BH went thru your head now, weighing as much as mount everest, youd lose a line of atoms, then it would be gone."],"points":16},{"text":["Could androids and replicants solve the falling birth rates problem and keep the population level stable?","With automation we don't need as many people as we have, so a shrinking population isn't a bad thing.","Exactly what is the \"falling birthrate problem\" you see?","Falling population is a really really good thing. Economically it can be a problem. It's really the only currently feasible method of restoring Earth's ecology.","falling birth rates problemWhy is this a 'problem'!? There might short term labour shortages but long term it's great for the environment which makes it great for humans.","There is no birthrate problem, except that the birthrate is far too high. There is a capitalism problem and the AI and robots will solve that.","falling birth rates is not a problem, it's only a problem for the people who want to make us all work for them. natalists and those in power are pushing the \"failing birth rates problem\" propaganda because they're afraid of losing money. let the population decline, it needs to.","I'm more curious about the problems they will create than the ones they will solve.","The problem is there are too many humans consuming too much resources.  The last thing we need is to burn more resources creating artificial life.","falling population is fine if we can get longevity solutions","I personally don't think we will see many humanoid type robots, except for maybe like niche applications. People will be replaced in the workforce by robots but they won't look like us. It's much easier to build dishwashers, robot vacuums, robot lawnmowers, robotic warehouses, farms and factories with robots built to suit the individual tasks than to replicate the exact human form to do all of these tasks.There is already a robotic dark supermarket in London that picks and packs orders for delivery. Tom scott did a YouTube video about it a couple of years ago. The robots look nothing like humans, it's not laid out so a human could operate within it. Basically it's more cost effective and efficient to build it in a non human styleA stable or growing population is only needed under the current economic model where humans are required to undertake the labour. This economic model will change as more businesses automate, because they have to, to remain competitive.Dunno what the new model will look like. I have my fingers crossed for some form of environmental - democratic socialism - ubi hybrid but not holding my breath on that","Or, or, we could focus on making life better for humans.  Give more incentive to have children. Like Healthcare, better wages, and better housing.","The population is way too high as it is. I'm not saying we need a culling or anything, but we need to shrink. growth can not be indefinite.Also androids wouldn't solve anything unless we pay them living wages so they can keep the economy active.","Think of humans as they are now, prompting AI to do it's bidding. At some point in the future, the humans will be some other form entirely, and all other things their playthings. Sounds creepy, right? Yes.","I don't know, but if the androids mow, do windows, and some house work, I'm interested in one.","Or how about just fixing the bullshit state we live in so people want to have kids? Jesus people want to use the most complex solutions when simple ones exist.","Why control population?

I continually learn about bottlenecks to life - the Goldilocks zone, liquid water, plate tectonics, ozone, astroid-deflecting Jupiter, correct position in the galaxy, all kinds of things. If half of these are accurate life seems very scarce. From there, the bottlenecks to complex life start and things just get worse. Folk like to imagine the discovery of alien life as a significant thing. One is free to feel about it however they like, but would it really be revolutionary to find a scant amount of a single-cell organism on another planet? Not an intelligent life, not a thriving ecosystem, not a Pandora’s box of possibility, but just one type of mold, let’s say. Is that what we’re hoping for?It seems to me that the real prize which captures our imagination is human-like intelligent life. It seems to me that we’re interested in humans, or a human-alternative.

I personally suspect most life is simple and below the surface of its planet or moon, so our most fruitful means to find life will likely involve missions to Titan, Enceladus, or Pluto.

Life should be relatively common in the galaxy. JWST is apparently already generating data consistent with theories of life chemistry. In other words, JWST is apparently finding chemical signatures we believe are generally products of biological sources, and only biological sources.The problem is going from \"We found chemical spectra consistent with our understanding of biology\" to \"We found definitive proof of little green men.\"","I'm assuming that it already found us based on the wording of those questions.","I hope we do.

BART is expected to construct one of its stations at the Diridon complex. And it’s possible that high-speed rail trains someday might zoom into the station.“Putting a project of this magnitude adjacent to transit is the best outcome for the transit agencies,” Staedler said. The construction of the infrastructure for the project could begin in about three months, estimated sources familiar with Google’s plans. The vast infrastructure endeavor is expected to take about 18 months to complete.That timeframe suggests the vertical construction of the first office building could occur in 2024.“This is getting closer,” Knies said. “We’re going to find out when the first shovel will be in the ground, where the first phase of development will be, when can we touch it, when can Downtown West become part of our lives.”","It's strange that it has not happened yet.

If the state becomes too weak or too dysfunctional a powerful organization will expand to fill the void in order to make the system work for them.Two examples:1) Huge Post Soviet enterprises like Gazprom operated an entire private economy when the Russian economy stopped working. Retail stores, schools, financial and personal services for their workforce in addition to a self sustaining supply chain.2) The Egyptian military currently operates a diversified parallel economy with lots of businesses providing goods and services that are in no way military related. This may be partially because the political and economic system in Egypt is so crony/closed/corrupt that military officers have no prospects in the private sector when they leave the service so instead they just never leave and instead run a business within this private economy. They could coup and run the government if they're forced to, but they'd rather avoid the hassle.In the US really our problem is more the opposite: Walmart is happy that there's a social safety net so they can pay a low wage thats augmented by food stamps. Boeing is happy that their defense contracts allow them to be sloppy as shit and still make money.

This is a unique property of lime-based cements which form the glue of concrete and represent the source of their CO2 emissions at the time of manufacture.Secondly, we should understand that burning one fifteen gallon tank of gasoiline releases the equivalent of one ton of concrete before we look at the fact that the concrere will absorb atmospheric CO2.A large portion of the CO2 emissions from concrete are simply from the petrochemical fuel used to bring the lime up to the industrial temperatures needed to hydrate the lime. Switching to electrical power for this part of the process would bring the CO2 emissions to neutral when we realize that concrete absorbs back the CO2 that is released when lime is hydrated as it cures.This means that concrete is not a contributor to atmospheric CO2 levels aside from the fact that it is currently dependent upon the burning of petrochemical fuels in its manufacture. The problem is the combustion of petrochemicals --period.These sorts of misplaced attempts to pretend that the blame lies elsewhere need to be confronted with the facts.

Google Glass was nowhere close to being real AR glasses, was barely usable, and a terrible product with no real world use. It was basically a very mediocre and tiny HUD projected.The Hololens are the main, and maybe only real \"ar glasses\" (with the Magic Leap, which ended up being very similar to the Hololens albeit slightly worse), at least known to the public. Visually, it really was convincing. The content shown in the real world is obviously digital, but it doesnt look like a screen ( because it isn't) and it looked sick, better than anything i have tried. Unfortunately, they had a horrible FOV, and their limitations, cost and bulkiness prevented it from being widely adopted. And according to Microsoft, the tech hit a wall in terms of possible FOV improvement (which is ridiculous at 45º vs human eye at 210º), which severely limits its usability and future developpment. They apparently even gave up entirely on the Hololens due to difficulty improving the technology, so i am not sure we will ever see their \"screen\" tech in a mainstream glass, like ever, despite it being the only real AR technology as of now.Apple Air vision is the hybrid step, being a pure VR headset with cameras that allows passthrough, simulating an AR experience. Its not there yet tech wise, looks much less convincing than the waveguide tech of AR glasses, fails on several aspects and will be a niche product. But i suspect they could be a prototype of what will be the first \"glasses\" the mainstream will adopt, at least initially.Meta apparently is working on a mainstream glass (they said they aim for sunglass form factor) for around 2026/2027 and it will be their first glasses directed at the mainstream. I suspect it will basically employ the same kind of formula as the current Vision Pro (VR with cameras, simulating AR) but with better tech and significantly more streamlined at a lower price.","If there were a pair of glasses I could wear that would do facial recognition and float someone's name above their head I would be 10000000% on board.If it could go one step further and have a little bullet point list of notes on the person it becomes a shut up and take my money device.Doesn't need to do anything else.

I tried the xreal glasses and they were really cool but not quite clear enough to read text. It was cool for movies but there were blurry spots that made reading impossible. We are so close.","I think you forget one big issue with Google Glass was the voyeur problem. You might have no issues getting filmed or your info being public, but other people might. Imagine someone getting into a public bathroom, phone up, recording everything. He would be kicked out ( I don't know if it's illegal, but it would be creepy). Same thing happened with the Google Glasses. People saw someone using it in a bar and got uncomfortable. I doesn't matter if the person super promises he is not recording. Should you trust him?. Now, what if technology is good enough that the glasses now look like regular glasses. How do you know if you are being recorded without consent?. I don't know the answer to these questions. You might think it is no big deal, maybe you have no problem being recorded when in public (security cameras film us all the time without consent) but other people might feel it's invasive. I think some companies are considering this, that it might be problematic, and that's why, as of now, they are not moving forward.","I wish they'd would invest in it again. I have a perfect and broad implementation for this type of tool. I do it now with phones, but it is cumbersome. But it improves my teams productivity by a ton, so the tradeoff is fine. If I could do this work hands-free and also have a little AR, I would be pulling down a bunch more revenue for my team. I wish I could talk to the director of the google glass program and help them with implementation and practical applications. I think I could sell to a bunch of companies after conducting a pilot program and cases studies.","Metas Raybans? The Quest 3 with pass through mode that came out last year and the Apple Vision Pro that just sold its 200,000th unit? I’m excited for it to keep getting better- I want to be able to work anywhere in my house with virtual screens everywhere and not be tethered to my desk.","Don’t make me go back in your history to find where you called me a glass hole","Not as ambitious as Google Glass was but there’s been an uptake in passive AR displays recently. Connects with another device via USB-C, usually phones, to act as a display. Little to no interaction with reality though, basically just float a display in front of your face, sometimes with body relative tethering and 3DOF head tracking when combined with certain devices.They’re limited but a pretty decent baby step into AR at a much more affordable price. I got a pair of Xreal Air for less than $400 that I’ve mostly used for flights and hotel stays to watch shows and movies. They’re also getting momentum in the handheld gaming communities because they let you connect to a Steam Deck or other handheld PC to have a large screen with a small device. They can also be used with PC or Mac to have multiple floating virtual displays for productivity but I haven’t tried that yet myself.Xreal is moving back into more interactive AR with the Air 2 Ultras they just showed off at CES with a lot of the features of more expensive and conversion AR headset. They have cameras and now have the ability to do 6DOF tracking, environmental mapping, and hand tracking so you can do a lot more like pinning virtual object an into the environment and interacting with them directly.I believe they said they’ll cost around $600, which is definitely far more affordable/practical than most true AR solutions. The only downside is they only support 2 Samsung phones at launch for the full feature set limiting the audience severely. Hopefully they’ll get more general SDKs out for other platforms fairly quickly.But I feel the new AR market will spring from these once the tech matures a little bit. Reportedly both Google and Apple are working on projects in the same form factor but it’s likely a while until we see those as the smaller companies work out the kinks.Look up XReal Air, Rokid Max, Viture One, and Rayneo Air for some examples of what’s currently available.","The meta raybans are pretty awesome.

E.g. they can say \"count down 5 minutes\" and get a little chime and in turn they get recorded throughout the day :).When it comes to the google glass and similar AR/AI type recording wearables: people are recorded without their consent or knowledge for someone else to get some value out of it. Which is why it's not very ethical to buy in to these devices making it a much more niche market.That hasn't stopped companies from making it happen. There were some instagram attempts in the recording piece which was too invasive. The there is NReal in the AR space. And there is this pin wearable by Humane which records everything and feeds it to a mobile app for whatever purposes. Not to mention Apple's new headset which may not exactly be Glass, but it's still in the same arena as well as the latest Quest devicestldr; the development in the AR space has never stopped, nor have the ethical concerns become any less. Big companies have continually invested in this space.","apple just announced one , you couldnt have possibly missed it imo","I think the main issue is that it doesn't really matter how good and well developed the product is, the vast majority of people just aren't going to be interested in wearing some kind of device on their heads that solves a problem that doesn't exist.","https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/ray-ban-meta-smart-glassesEdit: not sure if they're worth a damn, zuck and all","That, 3D movies and VR goggles come and go since I can remember. One thing I know for sure, those things are not for me","None of what you're claiming killed Glass, was actually what killed Glass.Glass died in infancy for the same reason most technology products that die in infancy do.It was a solution with no problem.There is no pressing need to have continuous on-face data display today, and there wasn't then.Furthermore, Glass would have failed even if there was a serious need for worn visual displays.The Glass API was tightly integrated into internet connectivity and a Google API that absolutely required the wearer to authenticate themselves to Google to use the device.A mighty hi-ho fuck-all to any sense of portability, not even mentioning privacy... for something people would be expected to wear.Wander out of wifi range? It's a brick. On your face.Want to develop an app to run on Glass? Good luck. The documentation for that locked-in API was useless dogshit.The best hardware engineering and sleekest form factor means fuck all if the use case is nonexistent and the end-users can't exploit said hardware to even find what a use case might be.Google ain't no Apple, because Jobs had already been saying this two and a half decades prior. Classic tech mistakes.","I work on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.
