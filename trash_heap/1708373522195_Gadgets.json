Baby monitoring cameras and pet cameras, especially have horrible security. People buy them for cheap on Amazon from random no-name companies that usually just buy them and slap their name on and resell them. They usually have zero consideration for security. Having devices like these on your network can open up all devices on your network to attacks.","Stop putting live feeds of the inside of your home in the cloud. If you want security cameras, invest in a system that records locally only, and is only accessible while on your network (or with a secure VPN).Stop putting cameras IN your home. They should be outside only if you really value privacy.","This doesn't sound like a breach at all, it sounds like a bug. Breaches are malicious intent, which I'm reading none of.

These id's are normally 36-character alphanumeric strings or better known as uuids in any type of common sense platform. They don't change once assigned to an item. So why caching could cause access to other people's cameras is beyond me.","Another win for self hosting with blue iris or an alternative.Why anyone trusts these companies I'll never know.","I don‚Äôt have any of their cameras, but I do have a couple of their smart plugs and now I‚Äôm worried someone else can use my electricity!!","This is why I don‚Äôt use the cloud and I have SD cards in mine.

I don't think the 4/64GB version is worth it if you want to use it for the four years it's supported for.One thing they have stated wrong is the amount of OS updates.

It sucks that the iPad Mini is basically the only option for a premium 7-8\" tablet, and it's over 2.5 years old at this point with no replacement due any time soon, apparently. I'll never forgive Google for discontinuing the Nexus 7 line, those were basically perfect small tablets. The size was just right for reading and the fact that they were Google products meant you got bone-stock Android without all the crapware the other manufacturers add in.
