Whether companies choose to go this route is another question, but it will undoubtedly make customer service even more awful. Do you really want to be refused a refund because the model is incorrectly, incorrigibly convinced that you're ineligible?","It's funny how behind this sub is. Customer chatbots were one of the first things people thought about doing with LLMs. Tons of companies have solutions for these for sale already or their own inhouse solutions.Usually no fine tuning is needed. The pattern most commonly used is retrieval augmented generation (RAG, google it!). It is very simple to implement and enables your LLM to answer based on your company's documents.It is also easy to let the chatbots interact with external functionality or systems. It's called function calling and works really reliably. It is all there and came with insane speed.Source: cannot count the number of smart chatbots anymore which have popped up since the last year in my company","I attended a demonstration of a call centre in a box, whilst still early in development I was shocked at how good it was. With the feeding of more data from all the recorded calls the company was purchasing, I suspect this product will improve dramatically. It‚Äôs going to have a serious impact on countries where handling customer calls is big business like the Philippines etc.","If this is your thought - if you look at all this and think \"Companies are going to save so much money\" - then we are all fucked.That $135 billion is the livelihood of every single one of those customer service folks - it's the company's contribution to the social contract they have with us.Breaking that contract breaks the country..","Yeah...

It will be much more friendly to use for the aging population.Virtual avatar will use a language model that is integrated with all pricing and policy info and will be able to do much more complicated things than current software. I imagine kitchens will be ran with human employees until robotics is cheap enough. Robotics currently make the most sense utilitarian wise in shipping facilities a la amazon. I imagine though they will come down in price and eventually for the cost of a years salary you can have your own AI robot make food for you.

For the price of a small car within the next decade I predict you can have a house robot to cook and clean for you.

You don't win an election by having the best voting record or best economic plan. You win by telling an engaging story, with the right feelings, good guys, bad guys, dramatic arc, etc. You can make it funny, scary, urgent, dramatic, etc. You might tell a story about how immigrants or AI or global warming or the other party are a threat to the nation. You humanise it and dramatise it. A good story has to hit you in the gut - it's feelings, not logic.Advertising works the same way: it's story telling.Of course AI's can be trained on the best orator and story-tellers who ever lived. Also the best salesmen, and most charismatic political and religious leaders who ever lived.AI's can tell very convincing stories, and because the web collects so much information on us, we can each receive a story custom-tuned to our own personalities and prejudices.We will all be putty in AI's hands.","So, basically:1) It will initially take over creative/storytelling jobs, and then in time 2) It will gain too much power over our life.What exactly is the \"new\" threat here? I can't see the point you're making.I strongly recommend Yuval Harari's books for a more reasoned and informed POV: Sapiens on the importance of stories in our daily lives and Homo Deus on future fears.Finally, I recognize and accept your right to ramble, but for a person supposedly making a living from writing, this was just horrendously put together and utterly unconvincing.

This sub will be quick to call him a Luddite. There is some truth to that.However, you referenced your job includes \"regulatory documents.\" This suggests your job is significantly tied to interpreting and understanding legal language. If you get this wrong then that is an unbelievable risk to your company. Why would you get it wrong? Because we know AI hallucinates. It makes things up that aren't real. Imagine you wrote a document with regulatory guidance based on an interpretation of the law that isn't based in the actual language. We know AI does this.If you're using it to create visualizations, process data, or draft points based on outlines or notes... that's all fine. If you're using it to summarize legal documents, I would personally give you one warning to never do that again and if you kept doing it I would fire you.I may be reading too much into that one line in your post, but I'm going to assume your boss is generally a reasonable person which is why this disagreement is jarring. I think the concern is valid for that narrow use case. The rest of it should be fine.","My boss and management are 100% pragmatic about AI. We're not doing this for happy fun demo time, or academic excellence.

Objectively good if you are both reading and validating it's output.Having it parse legal documents into summaries? Good God no. Regulatory documents are dense for a reason.

Reading a summary first before reviewing the document could be helpful for understanding context I suppose.I sincerely hope you are using a product that is appropriately secure for injecting that level of sensitive data into.","my boss encourages me to use gpt and it actually helps alot, your boss seems old and regressive","You're making yourself a target.At some point, your boss will realize that AI is doing your job and just cut you out of it entirely.Keep using it, but if you want to keep your job, keep your mouth shut about it, and just use it to negotiate a better salary and package for yourself.","Academics and supercargo professionals (the boss in your scenario) are going to develop a profound distaste for the use of LLM's among peers and subordinates.Boss is probably upset because he's worried he's going to have to explain you or promote you. And the last thing he wants to do isEither.The academic professional class has a strong vested interest in minimizing the use of AI in their professional work. They've studied for decades to gain the competencies they bring to their jobs.They fear to be replaced by people who can operate an LLM with a fraction of the education and costs they bring to the table.As a result you are going to see the same kind of academic resistance to the academic use of LLMs to complete academic work as we saw when Google's search engine was announced and academics were concerned that students wouldn't know how to source correctly or use library services.","My boss has openly embraced generative AI and its made our work all the better for it.
