What is the point of watching 2D movie on a headset capable of 3D?I know some 3D conversions have been crap but a lot have been really good.","we went from building computers for $3k to now buying headsets for $3k","If there‚Äôs a market they will come. AppleTV was barren for a long time, now it has all the major providers (even if half the apps are terrible.)","Time.There's not been enough time with the devices to ensure the app is as good as it can be. They don't just want to get it working. They want it to be good.","For now.","Is that Dave 2D in the thumbnail","lol they're not doing it today but they'll come around obviously","Spotify I understand, because Apple Music is there to take its place. YouTube seems like a body blow, but given Apple‚Äôs rivalry with Google, the story checks out.","I wont be surprised if MS puts the entire office suite on it day one","They will.Just not yet because I doubt it makes financial sense to sink a load of development time into something that feels like a live beta product.There seems to be a lot of testing the waters here.","So from the demos though I just open safari on, log in and chill? Like native app would be nice but browser still works","My guess is that the price point for this model is too high to justify creating an app for what will likely be a minority of the VR users. On the other hand Netflix already has an app for the Meta Quest so it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to port especially since Apple has the tools to port the app from iPad it sounds like there is something else going on.","I wouldn‚Äôt use a youtube app anyways unless I can get an Adblocker. Plus cant you just mirror you mac with said app","Just opens up a market that was fairly locked out. Recall MS did this in 90s and it didn‚Äôt work for them either."],"points":185}]
