So something with Processor or chipset (or maybe RAM).No, but it's an easy mistake to make. WHEA crashes are confirmed by the CPU's error record, a hardware error log in the CPU. The CPU logs errors for itself and PCIe devices. When reading these errors Windows uses the Intel driver so it will always list that in a WHEA crash (Or AMD driver with an AMD CPU).You will find lots of people saying RAM with WHEA crashes, but WHEA doesn't monitor RAM. If you use XMP speeds higher than what is officially supported by the CPU you are overclocking the memory controller (Part of the CPU) which can cause WHEA crashes. On your CPU this is 3200MT/s DDR4 and 5600MT/s DDR5. It's not really common to get WHEA crashes from this, usually you get crashes that look like faulty RAM, but it can happen.After I tried to read the minidump-files (first with bluescreenview), the problem occured everytime with:ntoskrnl.exe+4fed2b and PSHED.dll+10c0Bluescreenview (And Whocrashed) is not a good tool for a lot of reasons and just doesn't work for debugging WHEA crashes. As you have a dump file, please share it following the method posted by the bot. A good debugger is WinDBG Preview which you can get for free from the Windows Store.From your other issues I would have faulty storage as the main suspect, but crashing can corrupt files so that might be why you had those other issues.A bad PSU can cause WHEA crashes, but it's not common."],"points":0},{"text":["AMD's DVRLogs have filled up my Appdata and my main Windows Install Disk, How do I deal with it?"],"points":0},{"text":["How to install nvidia games ready driver on windows 11.","Making changes to your system BIOS settings or disk setup can cause you to lose data.

Its likely one of two issues, or possibly both, either the power supply board, or the backlights are out. Neither part is probably extremely expensive. Typically just searching for model number and either backlights or power supply board will get you some hits. C715 may not be the full model number, you may want to check to verify that's correct, it may be something like 55C715 or something.Edit: should have mentioned there is also a 3rd possible part, a chance of it being the LED driver board.Then it's off to youtube, there are videos out there, but I couldn't quickly find one for C715 specifically, but there are other TCL models and watching the video of how to DIY would give you an idea as to if you are feeling handy enough to attempt this yourself. There are even some videos out there that give you more details on how to diagnose these issues specifically so you aren't guessing which part.Before ordering your part(s), you'll probably want to open the TV up and look for part numbers on the power board and backlights as an extra means of verifying you have the correct parts before ordering. TV Model number should work in most cases, but it's never a bad idea if you can verify by the specific part number or make sure the picture matches what you have before ordering. Saves you time and grief if trying to return something.Alternately, if you don't feel like you can tackle this by yourself, or don't feel comfortable, then if you post in a local sub (if available) there may be someone near you that offers repair services that would tackle it for you. Or if you know someone that is electronic savvy or does things for a hobby they may be willing to attempt. For someone that has done some small electronic work before, it wouldn't be a huge burden to attempt something like this.I recommend taking lots of photos as you are disassembling so you can refer to them later in case you forget how it goes back together.Good luck.
