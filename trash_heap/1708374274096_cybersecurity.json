If both fail or are not aligned, DMARC fails and the recipient should handle the message as specified in the policy, though this may be overridden.In the case of third parties sending mail on your behalf, you should have a CNAME record set up to the relevent TXT record of the service provider containing the DKIM public key, so the domain can align.Assuming your SPF record is well managed and regularly audited, and DKIM records are set up properly, there should be no illigitimate mail passing on DMARC unless a users account (or service provider) is compromised.All of these mechanisms protect your own domains from abuse.

Not a compromised account but a keen worker!Lots of use cases depending on the environment.","It is a niche use case, but can be useful for access logging, auditing, or even alerting when users are entering a restricted area. Useful for impossible travel or location based alerting too - How did User A swipe in if they also established a VPN connection? Why did User B log on to an office workstation if there’s no record of physical entry today. Might even be for fire drill reporting - you have an up to date list of everyone who entered the building.Once had a use case for monitoring employee entry times and comparing their working hours but HR typically nixes that.","You can feed whatever logs you want into a SIEM. And depending on the information available, you can easily configure alerts surrounding physical access using your SIEM.","Why not? Perfect use case to monitor who/when someone badged in/out.","We feed it our badge logs mostly for impossible travel detections, forensic situations, and anomaly detection. It's not 100% necessary for the cyber security team to have those logs, but since we have the big log aggregator and a bunch of smart people, we get to have them lol.","We considered it for insider threat cases like people entering offices at odd times coupled with other UBA signals. Kinda fell off the radar with Covid and physical office access not being a thing due to WFH for the majority of people.","Absolutely. Our physical access control logs are ingested and used in correlation searches and support investigations. It also helps for separate physical security solutions at different sites where it can alert not only physically impossible virtual logins, but for example, also identify if somebody is breaking the laws of physics (as in, they're not in two places at once).","I've seen it done for a well-known government body who were super fixated with the bottom of the stack; they had super robust controls around datacentre access &c. Further up the stack was neglected, lots of risks (for instance they didn't have VPNs so they wanted a cable duct filled with concrete to mitigate the risk of somebody on the campus physically tapping into a cable between buildings, like a 1970s spy movie). Anyway, the service owner wanted extra detective controls so they'd know which engineer went into which hall of the DC at what time.They use the data to find \"gaps\" in some of their procedural controls around access (by trusted engineers who had a change request &c); maybe they found some more direct security benefits, perhaps around monitoring remote workers, but from my perspective they wanted the logs and they got the logs and I got paid. :-)Also as an interim thing when a company split, they were untangling their IT as well as their physical sites simultaneously and wanted to be able to look for patterns of entry that didn't match our assumptions. Maybe it identified some cleaners or site-maintenance people &c.​Thought the use case for SIEM was to monitor network infrastructureA SIEM can monitor all kinds of other stuff! Especially on the server side.","As long as the system generates useable logging. This was the whole fusion concept and a big pitch between ASIS and ISC2 a decade ago.Real problem (my personal observation), organizational silos around physical security and infosec and challenges giving up or sharing their empires created challenges.Useful applications exist for sure.These days I see a lot of folks asking to correlate acms data with IP/login information to say “person X at site Y is physically present at the location from which the user logon took place”; But not for security…more for monitoring who’s actually “Getting back in the office so we can all be together again”.","A good SIEM can take nearly any log and manipulate it as you please. The only two real limitations are that the log source must have a standard format that makes sense and that you have the ability to write a parser if the vendor doesn't already provide one.Airports can have a mixture of IT, OT, and other such that SIEMs can ingest and take action on.The biggest challenge here is that physical security often is its own vertical. But, imagine if a SOC gets an alert that someone has opened a door at 2am on a Sunday that has never been opened at 2am on a Sunday. They can contact physical security and have them investigate.Similarly, if your logs capture when someone badges in, it may catch a duplicated badge doing an \"impossible badge-in\" where they badge in the East Coast location and within an hour badge in at the West Coast location.Just because it isn't common, doesn't mean it shouldn't be happened.","I’ve heard of a company monitor when a user is logged i to a device and moving around. If they’re actively logged into a computer in building A , it’s a notable if they suddenly try to access building B if they’re still logged in.","Maybe a usecase for ai to spot abnormal behavior?","You can but it’s not much good without detection rules. I doubt the SIEM vendor would have a prebuilt parser so you’d likely need to set that up first and then made detection rules for the log source.","Most SIEMs can take in both structured and unstructured data. The problem is always what the source can do. Can it actually feed its logs in realtime or does it only export logs to a file that has to be read in.","Depends on the SIEM, but yeah doesn't sound crazy, might require a little scripting and regex.Used to run data centers and we had a few scripts to read access badges to see when employees and customers showed up. Big Bosses wanted to see them correlate room access with downtime events, like routers going down, UPS/power issues, etc. That never happened AFAIK, but it was used mostly to see when the employees were working and how hard -- moving in and out of rooms a lot meant motion == handling tickets. Sitting in the NOC == doing nothing, or so they thought.Correlating entry to valid access tickets and/or loading dock removal tickets was another idea but never materialized.","Yes.

Our only \"restricted\" room is our data closet. I actually loop the physical review in with the quarterly RBAC review. I don't actually look for unauthorized access, I just confirm that those who do have access still have it for valid reasons.

If you want to the actual desktop you will need to allow X11 port forwarding. You'll have to modify the EC2 firewall settings and do it the regular way or via an SSH tunnel. You'll also need to use a client that supports X11 displays. I would look at using something like VNC server on your Kali, VNC Client, and configure the ports.

I'm seen people \"audit\" and validate software by… sending an email to the vendor asking if it is secure. If the vendor replied \"yes\" they'd get a stamp of approval. These people only got the job because of relations.","Unfortunately this is more common than I personally think it should be and honestly a disservice and detriment to the industry as a whole and overall. My own experience has been that people only partially, minimally, or barely qualified for a given role are hired because of who they know (I've never seen someone with absolutely zero professional skills make it into cyber). I know I've never been hired based on my connections alone (and I have tried). That being said, I would agree that knowing the right people gets you places or, as was the case with me, can help you stay where you are, even if only ensuring you're among the last to go in difficult times (like these where the tech sector has seen massive layoffs).I'll elaborate. Looking at my experience (if you're in the industry and the know) you wouldn't question my qualifications or expertise. I was lucky enough to be kept on while my employer at the time was struggling financially (not debt, just not being as profitable as the slave driver shareholders would have liked) and im fairly certain it was due not only to the recognition of my skills and value but also being personable or at the very least memorable for the right reasons to the right people.By the same token, I've also seen completely incompetent people remain not only employed but in positions of power or worst yet promoted, this is what you would refer to as failing upwards. Unfortunately, there is no denying that the mediocre still have a place on the corporate ladder and it's most unfortunate and down right maddening that it's not exclusively the bottom rung or the unemployment line. There is also no denying that the biggest reason for their continued success has been their soft skills, being great to work with or just good at brown nosing, blaming others, begging for second chances, or being pathetic enough to warrant people's pity can get you places.I've often wished for and have contemplated possible solutions to this problem but ultimately I believe there is no beating the fact that it's possible to remediate a lack of skill or knowledge but you can't do much about changing someone who has a shitty attitude and is unpleasant to work with.","Every career is a who you know field. Very few people (proportionally speaking) are so immensely lucky as to be able to land a brand new career opportunity with zero experience and zero connections, especially when there are more people trying to transition into the job than there are positions.

The team was filled with people who she knew and no skill and only two of us were “real techs”.","Yes, I think in part because it's a relatively well paid industry and one where we don't want a lot of churn and turnover in the roles, and there are a lot of applicants. So if you're hiring for a position and you have a pile of resumes, you're going to lean toward the people you know. Those people might not have had the experience but the person hiring them likely knew they were fully capable of learning the job.","Networking matters, most definitely. But also, everyone starts with zero experience. I started working in a computer lab in college and got a little bit of experience. I graduated with BA and no clue what to do. Someone put my resume in front of a manager for a helldesk and then I worked my way up. I won't see I haven't had a bit of help here and there. But most of the jobs I've gotten was on the strength of my resume and my interview skills.","I got hired into my first role due to my name. Not kidding lol.I was someone without a degree struggling to get into the field. I applied for a job at a start-up company. I knew no one there and had no referral, within a day I got a response from the hiring manager.I went through all 4 interviews and finally got hired. And once I got hired the hiring manager said, she was scrolling through the list of applicants, saw my name and thought “huh, I’ve never heard that name before”, saw I was qualified for the job and decided to give me a call.That was 3 years ago and I have since moved up in the company but I am having a hard time trying to move to another company.

Hiring managers would typically rather go with someone they know (or someone who was vouched for by someone they trust).

Most people do the latter.When I see people here having difficulty getting hired, the common denominator is almost always that they're just firing resumes into the ether and hoping for the best.Go to conferences, participate in local groups, be active on LinkedIn, etc. It helps a ton.","Absolutely.

If you can't articulate exactly how a system works you don't deserve to have it.","1: First firewall filter rule - which is left disabled - is an emergency network cutoff of the LAN from the outside world. No traffic allowed in or out. This allows internal systems to remain operative, but is designed to isolate the network from a large-scale cyberattack (nation-state type) with a single click.2: Last firewall rule - which is always on - blocks all traffic in or out that has not been previously allowed by other filter rules.3: All filter rules in between those two are based on that network's specific needs, and only traffic necessary to conduct business is allowed in or out.4: Traffic to and from Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran is specifically blocked (assuming the company doesn't do business in those countries).","Last rule is your blanket implicit deny.

Monero) mining pools - block them with whatever you've got: DNS filter, firewall, etc.At best you have some schmuck who thought it'd be a great idea to cook their workstation overnight. At worst, cryptocurrency miners are damn prompt (example) when finding certain exposed resources and may be faster than you are...","deny any any","oh for sure, always start with deny all, then only allow what's absolutely necessary, keep those logs on for auditing, and don't forget to regularly update and patch the firewall software, it's like the basics but so crucial","Whitelists are easier to manage.","Apart from the obvious stuff that is essential for a firewall, I'm a fan of blocking outbound port 53 for everything except the internal DNS server.
