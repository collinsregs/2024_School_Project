However, this shift is likely to displace many workers in those service areas.

This was to attract big companies to relocate and provide new jobs in exchange for tax breaks.If the agreement required physical jobs onsite, remote jobs would likely not fulfill the contract.While it might have made sense prior to the pandemic, these agreements with the county governments are now relics of a bygone era.

Nearly all (92%) of the 5,000 respondents said the policy (zero mandated in-office days) is integral to their ability to carry out their best work, and 91% say it‚Äôs a banner reason that they‚Äôre staying at the firm.¬†‚Ä¢ Nearly all (99%) of the chief executives Atlassian surveyed said they believe that distributed work is the way of the future, and it‚Äôs only going to grow in popularity from here.‚Ä¢ Per Atlassian‚Äôs research, 1 in 3 Fortune 500 and 1000 bosses whose companies mandate some amount of in-person work say that the rule hasn‚Äôt impacted productivity at all. Those same executives were three times as likely to say that how their people work is more important than where they work.‚Ä¢ Even part-time in-office arrangements are a policy failure, Atlassian‚Äôs Annie Dean explained, which might be a blow to bosses who think they‚Äôre offering a compromise in the form of a hybrid plan. ‚ÄúHybrid is an illusion of choice,‚Äù she said.‚Ä¢ As the 1,000 Days retrospective makes clear, the office itself won‚Äôt actually solve any productivity, innovation, or creativity issues leaders are facing. ‚ÄúThose are all how to work problems, not where to work problems,‚Äù Dean told Fortune back in July‚Äîa sentiment the report echoes.","Creating a good company culture will lead to motivated employees, irrespective of where they choose to work.","How are you supposed to feel like a king if you can't see all of your subjects at once?","Are companies just that fat in this world where they just don't give a fuck about what impact their decision has.Always a slap on the wrist.","Return to the office only benefits corporate realestate investments.","If anything the remote work during the pandemic proved that companies can be extremely profitable with WFH.

Not in terms of positions. So this could very well mean that more positions are actually lost, but since they are lower -wage jobs, they don't make up a majority of \"dollar wages.\" I.e. if one person makes a million dollars, and 10 people make 40k, you could lay off those 10 people, and still have not laid off the majority of \"dollar wages.\" - Their focus on \"jobs where computer vision is employed\" is a weird sample group. I'm not clear how much we can extrapolate these findings to the overall labor market. - Regardless of the last two points, 23% is still a huge number of jobs.

He spends a lot of hours and attention each week aggregating and delivering information vs working on opportunities with customers. It is basically impossible to justify hiring a full time employee and training them to do 10 hours of work each week, but if we can get AI to do that 10 hours of work, he could legitimately double his revenue generating productivity.I do that once, then I can justify hiring another full time person and train them, knowing they can use AI to scale their abilities up, as well. There are more marginal dollars to play with in terms of upside.Eventually, I can work on all the projects that I believe will generate massive returns, but we don‚Äôt have the bandwidth of expertise and capital to currently pursue.Rule of thumb in my industry is that if I want to hire someone, there needs to be an upside of 5x their salary in gross profit dollars.

It likely won‚Äôt be the last","Everything is cool until a false positive incriminates you with no possible defence in court.","DNA does NOT contain information about the 3D structure of the organism it is coded to create, at least not in any way that is currently decipherable by modern techniques. This is unreproducible, garbage \"science\" that is basically astrology and has no place in our justice system. I'm glad the article addresses this.","Some highlights from this investigative piece:Parabon NanoLabs ran the suspect‚Äôs DNA through its proprietary machine learning model. Soon, it provided the police department with something the detectives had never seen before: the face of a potential suspect, generated using only crime scene evidence.The image Parabon NanoLabs produced, called a Snapshot Phenotype Report, wasn‚Äôt a photograph. It was a 3D rendering that bridges the uncanny valley between reality and science fiction; a representation of how the company‚Äôs algorithm predicted a person could look given genetic attributes found in the DNA sample.The face of the murderer, the company predicted, was male. He had fair skin, brown eyes and hair, no freckles, and bushy eyebrows. A forensic artist employed by the company photoshopped a nondescript, close-cropped haircut onto the man and gave him a mustache‚Äîan artistic addition informed by a witness description and not the DNA sample.In a controversial 2017 decision, the department published the predicted face in an attempt to solicit tips from the public. Then, in 2020, one of the detectives did something civil liberties experts say is even more problematic‚Äîand a violation of Parabon NanoLabs‚Äô terms of service: He asked to have the rendering run through facial recognition software.‚ÄúUsing DNA found at the crime scene, Parabon Labs reconstructed a possible suspect‚Äôs facial features,‚Äù the detective explained in a request for ‚Äúanalytical support‚Äù sent to the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center, a so-called fusion center that facilitates collaboration among federal, state, and local police departments. ‚ÄúI have a photo of the possible suspect and would like to use facial recognition technology to identify a suspect/lead.‚ÄùThe detective‚Äôs request to run a DNA-generated estimation of a suspect‚Äôs face through facial recognition tech has not previously been reported. Found in a trove of hacked police records published by the transparency collective Distributed Denial of Secrets, it appears to be the first known instance of a police department attempting to use facial recognition on a face algorithmically generated from crime-scene DNA....‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really just junk science to consider something like this,‚Äù Jennifer Lynch, general counsel at civil liberties nonprofit the Electronic Frontier Foundation, tells WIRED. Running facial recognition with unreliable inputs, like an algorithmically generated face, is more likely to misidentify a suspect than provide law enforcement with a useful lead, she argues. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no real evidence that Parabon can accurately produce a face in the first place,‚Äù Lynch says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very dangerous, because it puts people at risk of being a suspect for a crime they didn‚Äôt commit.‚Äù...Greytak characterizes the company‚Äôs face predictions as something more like a description of a suspect than an exact replica of their face. ‚ÄúWhat we are predicting is more like‚Äîgiven this person‚Äôs sex and ancestry, will they have wider-set eyes than average,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way you can get individual identifications from that.‚Äù...According to an internal New York Police Department presentation cited by Garvie in her report, NYPD detective Tom Markiewicz wrote in 2018 that the department has tried running face recognition on forensic sketches and found that ‚Äúsketches do not work.‚Äù In another infamous example that Garvie cites in her report, a detective from the NYPD‚Äôs Facial Identification Section, after noting that a suspect looked like the actor Woody Harrelson, put a photo of the actor through the department‚Äôs facial recognition tool.‚ÄúBecause modern facial recognition algorithms are trained neural networks, we just don‚Äôt know exactly what criteria the systems use to identify a face,‚Äù Garvie, who now works at the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, tells WIRED. ‚ÄúDaisy chaining unreliable or imprecise black-box tools together is simply going to produce unreliable results,‚Äù she says.‚ÄúWe should know this by now.\"This whole process sounds a lot like the classic GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out) scenario.

This is a disaster waiting to happen.","So this is where the Minority Report starts","What scares me about the proliferation of AI models like this is not how powerful the can be but the dangers associated with people using tools like these but lack the skills or are just to complacent to validate the results.Im read more and more about using models like these that seem to work really well when tested in a controlled way but start to give bad results when given real world tasks.","Police \"We wont attend robberies\"Also Police \"We'll use cutting edge untested and dangerous technology to try and find people who maybe committed crimes\"","Wow. That's just hot garbage. That's just using AI as an excuse to create random suspect pictures.We are still nowhere near being able to predict most characteristics from DNA, let alone facial features. Most forensic DNA sequencing technologies only sequence a tiny part of the genome, enough to be mostly certain DNA is a match with a person with an error of approx 1 in a million (depending on exact process). So in a country like the USA there would probably be a couple of hundred people that match. And the genes that determine facial structure are much more complicated than that. To actually get an idea of how a face could look would require a much more detailed sequencing, and knowledge of how that relates to facial features, this literally does not exist yet. And this is before we consider how environmental and developmental factors can affect facial structure.With that in mind, I don't think this is good enough to even give probable cause for arrest. Certainly not good enough for a warrant (though some judges will grant anything admittedly).

Do you need it yet?","Saving you a click. You don't need it now. Wait till it gets cheap and buy it later.","LOL 6E is barely affordable and how many of your devices actually have it‚Ä¶","Until my Internet egress reaches those speeds, no I do not need this.","I'm still using DSL internet in my rural ass town.","The answer is always NO. YOU DON'T NEED IT NOW.","I'm gonna say no... you can easily stream 4K at 120 FPS to multiple devices with no problems on WiFi 6. So unless you are constantly transferring massive files between multiple machines over WiFi, you probably won't see much benefit of 7, or even 6E over WiFi 6.","Boo Paywall","To answer the title: Not for a while.Just like 4K TVs coming out, there's very little reason to get one unless you have, or soon to have, something that can supply real 4k content to the TV.Back around say 2012, I worked electronics at walmart, the number of people who came in wanting a 4K TV, but didn't have anything that supplied that kind of resolution, all were 1080p DVD/Blueray users, the rest were satelite with 90% channels 720p/720i and the rest 1080p (if not 1080i). Many people were happy to find out about this difference, and either didn't buy, or bought a 1080p with the same fancy features just without the resolution. Yes, there's upscaling, but a 1080p frame is still 1080p, with or without the processing changes before, after, or without 4k upscaling, there isn't enough benefit to the cost (at least back then, arguably feedable today).As for the fast wifi, other than the range and penetration capabilities, a faster wifi can only go as fast as the weakest link. If the cable is rated for 100Mb and not 1Gb, not going to get over 100Mb in speeds (most cables are 1Gb capable, but people don't throw out 10year old network cables, much like phone cables, they all look the same at a glance). Internet not nearly as fast as the wifi? I'd say routers or switches, but 95% of those in use (including those older but still kicking, I replaced one last month) are 1Gb capable now, though some routers might be 1Gb capable, add in some firewall rules, and the processor is likely not fast enough to keep up.Then you have the winning agreement argument. Do you have any devices capable of using that Wifi7 setup? There's some backswords compatibility, sure, but not getting all of the capability of wifi 7, do your research and weigh your priorities vs costs.If you need more coverage, use wifi APs, please avoid wifi bridges/repeaters, each wifi hop only makes the connection slower in speeds and responsiveness. Wifi APs are more like your cell towers, (most) wired into a main line, instead of repeating off of each other, and you move between the APs like Cell towers, with very little to show you moved, while Bridges/Repeaters can result in different wifi names causing hand offs to be unreliable or very slow.Edit: I allowed autocorrect to do its work while I'm still waking up, that's not the word I was looking for...","The answer is always no if there is a question in the title. Ôøº","The answer to do I NEED it is almost any technology is no. This is of course true here as well. Wifi 7 is basically just stable wifi 6e at a 2x markup right now with less than 1% of device support. Just wait until a solid 40% of the devices you regularly use have support for it before even considering it. IMO it‚Äôs not worth it until 2.5 gbps ports replace 1 gbps ports EVERYWHERE as the default standard and become commodity devices.","Still dreaming of broadband that is more than 28mbps","Pretty sure I just have Wi-Fi 1.","I still have my original Google WiFi pucks that have been solid for 7 years. Do I get 1 or more Gbps bandwidth to my phone, well no, but who tf actually needs that?
