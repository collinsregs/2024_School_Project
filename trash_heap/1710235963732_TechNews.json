The protagonist is the UN cleanup guy that has to deal with all the \"Third World\" countries that have been experimenting with homemade singularities (black holes) for power production...The rest of the world has already figured out that down this path lay destruction for all- once a black hole created on Earth goes out of control (and nope, so-called \"third world\" countries learned the hard way that making one and CONTROLLING one are two totally different things), it would then sink to the center of our planet and begin consuming it. Us. All.But the nature of a singularity is that nobody outside the Event Horizon can know what's going on INSIDE that Event Horizon... So once someone loses control of one, ALL of our fates are now sealed, sucking down into that implacable maw, and nobody will know until somebody outside our planet notices that it's, that we're gone...This UN operative had to explain to various members of small African governments, reps or leaders of their respective energy ministries, about how this happened, the limits of human science and control. And it all ended up the same- he had to clean out the inside of his vehicle and replace passenger-side windows, again and again, as his passengers each finally figured out the gravity (ohh, I'm so sorry for that!!) of what their country had done and then capped themselves soon after."],"points":0},{"text":["Google Is Getting Thousands of Deepfake Porn Complaints"],"points":0},{"text":["Google Wallet can now show movie tickets and boarding passes from Gmail"],"points":0},{"text":["Samsung Galaxy A55 and Galaxy A35 launch with four years of Android updates","Cool beans.‚Äì sent from my five year old iPhone"],"points":1},{"text":["Pixel 8 series adds display output support with Android QPR3 beta"],"points":0},{"text":["Apple ramps up work on ad-supported Apple TV+ plan"],"points":0},{"text":["Tim Cook makes surprise appearance during Porsche event to talk Vision Pro","Wow how cool, two companies who have made it well past their glory days working together to milk every last drop of relevancy out of their wildly fervent clientele."],"points":3},{"text":["Bitcoin hits record above $72,000 as demand frenzy intensifies","Imagine the stupid money you could have made off nvidia and bitcoin‚Ä¶","Extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds","Bitcoin hit a record high above $72,000, as the biggest cryptocurrency's surge showed no signs of slowing down.¬†Bitcoin was last up 4.4% at $72,649 after reaching as high as $72,739.The world's most valuable cryptocurrency has been boosted by a flood of cash into new spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds and hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates.¬†\"The recent surge in Bitcoin's value ... underscores the remarkable strength and resilience of the leading cryptocurrency,‚Äù Bitfinex analysts said in a research note.¬†Read the full story for more.","Pump it Bogdan!","Yawn."],"points":12},{"text":["Microsoft's sneaky KB5001716 Windows 10 update pushes Windows 11","I want to go Linux so bad but sadly some anti cheat‚Äôs for games still don‚Äôt work under Linux.","This update fails to install on my old laptop which is way out of support for Windows 11, but sticks in Windows Update so it continues to attempt to install.
