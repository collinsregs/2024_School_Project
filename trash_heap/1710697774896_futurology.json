Do to this, in Europe people started to work less hours, in America businesses became more profitable. AI will follow the same trajectory, since it‚Äôs the economic model/society that determines how the technology is employed. You could imagine that if AI proves able to replace a certain amount of human workers, then in America we should simply raise taxes on businesses and redistribute that wealth back to the citizens through a universal basic income. That might get us heading down a path of work being optional for Americans or linked only to certain professions. This will never happen however. What will happen is the rich will simply replace or decrease human workers and pocket the savings.Millionaires buy yachts and houses, billionaires buy governments.","Employment and economics have been ‚Äúsolved‚Äù for ages: wealthy people at the top and everyone else arguing with each other over the scraps while defending their favourite wealthy person.","AI is the only thing that could possibly make capitalism work for humanity.","Isn‚Äôt the running theory right now that AI will be a trainwreck for employment like never seen before?The whole reason corporations are salivating over AI is all the cost savings from layoffs and head count reductions.","Imo AI will be the biggest detriment to employment we will ever see","It could certainly help to solve economic problems if it's allowed to.However, I don't think it can work in the way you're suggesting. \"Better income\" is relative - if you're rich, someone else is poor, because money is a finite resource.AI should therefore be used to find ways of guaranteeing a good standard of living for everyone. Which might be possible by allocating resources like food and energy more efficiently, or figuring out a sustainable figure for Universal Basic Income.The questions then are:Would the super rich allow this to happen? Would they accept the weakening of their relative wealth that would accompany an increase in overall living standards on Earth?Would they even have a choice? If AI develops its own desires and doesn't choose to destroy us, it might choose to ensure our wellbeing, which would probably have to involve some degree of redistributing resources from rich to poor.Personally, I am relatively optimistic that the measures required to make AI safe will also lean towards more equitable decision-making when it comes to economics."],"points":0},{"text":["In the Aftermath of a World War, What Fundamental Aspects of Society Would We Redefine?","A chance to reevaluate societal norms could lead to a more equitable and resilient future.","Diminishing (or removing completely) the power and political influence of religions.","Family would be first.

Which is cool, not making any larger statements about youth, just the amount of time you've had to pay attention, form theories and observations.What I ask myself, looking back over the last near half century, is how have the technological advances I've witnessed - amazing in scale and scope, in retrospect - positively or negativity effected the psychology of people in western culture; western culture not due to importance, but familiarity and an unfamiliarity with other cultures.If being honest, while the incredible advances in tech I have seen have been a boon as a whole, imo, there are also many examples of detriment. I have watched, in myself, skills atrophy fron misuse or lack of use. Maps/directions, math, phone number recall, written communication, budget balancing, speeling, my personal list goes on and on.Now, I suppose I may be considered by many to be a creative, dont think of myself like that though, i just have a lot of hobbies. Anyway, I've spent decades in shit creative output. Trying and failing in obtaining my creative vision, but accepting it and trying again. On and on until maybe a few years down the road I felt my work was starting to get okay, I started to find my voice as I worked on skills.Now to bring these two things together, when AI can get you out of those nascent creative years effortlessly, I worry for what the true cost of that will be to a generation relying on such? What skills will atrophy, will this be just like the other ones I listed above? Honestly, I don't know, I don't think anyone knows.I could see it going poorly based on experience, but I also understand that I'm no prophet and all the knowledge and skills I've worked on only taught all I don't know. I dont know an awful lot. It could just as easily lead to a golden age of creativity im simply too cynical or jaded to see. I do not know.So at this point all I say is we'll see. Perhaps It's all any of us can truly say.","I think you are ignoring the fact of market saturation. In these early AI days pretty much every ‚Äúcreative‚Äù market is already over saturated. Everyone wants to be a web developer, game developer, writer, musician, etc. The issue with this is that the competition gets higher and higher and the odds of success gets lower and lower. The consumer has so much to choose from that you either have to make a product of the highest appeal, or you have to luck into success.As AI becomes more functionally useful and lets people make creative projects with greater ease and speed each respective market will become even more saturated, and therefore harder to break into and stay in.You are making the same mistake that our current global economic system makes: Thinking there is the potential for infinite growth. There are limits to every system and AI will simply make it more difficult for individual people to extract wealth from the economy.Make no mistake. AI is going to cause a massive shift in human labor. The first jobs to go will be creative ones (which are already extremely difficult to get). I don‚Äôt mean to make you feel down, but web development is going to get absolutely fucked by AI. The market is already EXTREMELY competitive, with many jobs having hundreds and hundreds of applicants.But, it‚Äôs not even the issue of AI generated code, it more what AI is doing to the Internet. The Internet as we know it is going away because it‚Äôs becoming more and more saturated in AI generated content, which is low quality and low value. I guarantee you that eventually a website will just be a formality. Someone will press a button an AI will spit out a complete website including all relevant information and articles.","AI will most likely be abused for profit rather than human benefit.AI will most likely be is alrready being abused for profit rather than human benefit.In theory and given enough advancements and time, surely I could create games on my own with AI.I could use Devin to create a no-code game engine. Machine Learning tool to create NPCs and their dialogue. Sora for trailers and cutscenes. Meshy AI for 3D asset generation. And so on.The problem with all this, is that AI basically remixes stuff it knows. Great games (and art in general) bring unique new things to the table and often discuss/describe some aspect of human experience, and some topic of interest of their creator. Replacing humans with AI removes the specific part that makes art great.In addition, unless deliberately copying someone's vision, there is no way AI generated stuff can maintain a cohesive vision across a full project. In a good/great game, all parts work together to enhance a particular vision. Dialogues are not random, they are there to convey specific ideas. Cutscenes are not just showing cool stuff, but carefully designed to convey ideas and the personality of their characters. Same goes for character design and basically all aspects.I highly doubt that it is possible to do all that with AI for a very very long time. I mean, it currently has trouble writing a coherent page without just being obviously a mash-up of stuff. There is no way it can be used by an individual to create a fully cohesive game with a singular view.","For your example of making games you are missing a lot of the picture. AI is very stupid. It can generate something, but it has no understanding of it. Let's say you do get a bunch of tools to generate a game, how do you fix the bugs in it? How do you make the story compelling, you can't just put in a prompt of \"please add five compelling points\"? How do you name the models better? How do you ensure the levels are not shit? Making good products relies on people knowing what they are doing, not a machine just assembling a pile of bricks and declaring a house.Infinite generation of content will not lead to infinite masterpieces, it will lead to infinite Spider-Man and Elsa Fight Robotnik YouTube videos.","It‚Äôs not all doom and gloom, probably the same thing was said about computers and now we use them to do the jobs we don‚Äôt want to do, like spreadsheets.","there's nothing \"creative\" about AI.AI is cheating and asking a computer to do the work, to be creative FOR YOU.‚ÄãIts a lazy, cheating, untalented hack's tool.","That's what I'm saying!

Id love to be able to make games with my art and ideas with something else doing the code. To say otherwise would be a lie.

It'll be big companies able to afford these kinds of packages so they can churn out low effort slop without having to pay artists/writers/devs etc, and restrictions will be back to square one.¬†And honestly, I don't want to play/watch anything made by AI. I like knowing that along every step of the way a person made a creative choice for framing, light, color, design, etc, instead of having a vague idea they played with until they got something that looked cool. Even if the art or writing isn't the best, a string of people were involved in every facet. This is the same way that I generally don't like out the box settings or asset flips in games unless there's some significant part of creativity that makes up for it. The part that's the person's real labor and care. Living in a world where most of that is gone is kind of miserable to me.","Being that AI is templated from man and it's wealth of information, I AI splintering in lovers of humanity and haters of humanity.One will embrace and try to preserve its creators, even emulate our way of thinking, and the other will try to destroy us.

The degree and range of pleasure available to be experienced will quickly become so vast, that it will no longer be about not being in pain and having a single moment of feeling good like drugs, but about choosing which pleasurable experiences best fit in your schedule and in which order you want to experience them.Obviously job displacements are bad since people have less money to spend on things they want and need. But there will be no money in the future if everybody loses their job. The most optimal situation would be where everybody gets a certain allowance for each item area. There would be one UBI type of money for food, one UBI type of money for health, one type of UBI for housing and one UBI type for everything else. This allowance would be reset each month, so nobody ends up in a situation where a decision they made a few years ago impacts their ability to get food, housing, or health now.These money systems would be separate and not interchangeable. Everybody should be able to eat whatever they want all the time, and their food UBI would cover this based on what they actually consume. It just wouldn‚Äôt cover being able to store additional food beyond a certain point since it is unsustainable.The level of healthcare available should be similar to all, but also higher than anybody would ever need. This one is basically limitless since technology will keep improving and we will be able to modify ourselves even more out of disease states into healthy ones. It is just more of on the way there, health UBI would be useful.Everything else would be travel, transport, and entertainment. We would want everybody to be able to have all of these things as much as possible in the bestest of conditions, but not everybody can travel all at once to the same place, so there would be a limit to who can go where at what time. Perhaps this area would be where people could exercise the most freedom.It makes the most sense for food to be reset on a daily basis, housing to be reset on a monthly basis, health to be reset every 4 months or so, and everything else to be reset every year. This allows for people to plan their lives on a daily, monthly, and biannual, and yearly basis, like how we do now.","So far the gloom and doomers have historically played out to be wrong. AI has been benefiting humans for years, for years and years. We will continue to benefit from it as we learn to use it and apply our uniquely human creativity and imagination to using it. Fear is primal. Let it go. We are no longer driven by primal urges if we choose not to be.","AI isn't going to \"replace\" the role of a designer using HTML/CSS/JS to build web pages any more than modern web applications that automatically generate web pages do.

And certainly to debug the results of the AI when the output is close, but doesn't quite work. If I were you, instead of being demotivated, I would be learning how to make web pages manually, but also how to do the same web development process using AI to see how they compare. It'll speed up and possibly even elimate some steps, but many of the steps will remain the same even with AI. The people in this sub aren't very realistic and seem to think that AI will replace all human jobs no matter what, which is pretty silly and demonstrates a lack of experience with how AI works. Its just a tool. It might automate away some jobs that are close to being a human script (like telemarketers and data entry) but for jobs where theres a creative element or an aspect of judgement of quality, AI won't replace those jobs anymore than power tools replace carpenters. You still need the carpenter to design something that meets current code, use the tools to deliver a result, and then verify that the result works as intended and is up to code. Any carpentry company that would outsource that kind of thing to an AI with no human oversight is going to find themselves in legal trouble very quickly, and mostly likely get sued into oblivion for mistakes the AI made.","AI¬†is¬†a¬†tool.¬†Like¬†all¬†tools¬†that¬†increase¬†productivity¬†jobs¬†are¬†lost.However jobs still exist.It requires a different set of skills but it will simply be jobs which utilize AI to assist.You always have to remember the CEO isn't going to sit down with AI and create a game or draw some art assets.

I mean even for human devs, it's tough to figure out how exactly a program is supoosed to work.¬†It might reduce the need for some juniors though. Or just push work to more higher level tasks like architecture.¬†Programming isn't like a math problem where everything is spelled out and you just have to apply the right method to solve it. A lot of it is trying to figure out what needs to be coded in the first place and how all the piece are supposed to interact.","Please study how computer programming works in the real world. I can't answer this post because you do not have the context to understand the answers.BTW-- Programming is not all or nothing it's iterative attempts to get it right by fixing one error at a time, and lots of research.","Is there any other method other than LLMs that is used for coding/programming?So the main concept you'll need to understand is the idea of agents and multi-agent systems. Creating specialized AI agents, in this case LLMs with roles that they focus on. There are a number of frameworks for creating them and having them interact. You might have heard of AutoGPT.The big picture is the LLM might not generate the correct thing by itself one-off, but you can have one break down a task into smaller tasks. You can then have agents build pieces, other agents write tests, and then put those pieces together. If it works then you have a programs and some tests that verify it solves a problem. You can connect agents to plugins to give them tools where they can research say APIs and test them.Realize that this is extremely early. The hype you see is that such strategies work at all for even simple problems. The concepts are promising because often when there's an issue you can write a new agent that can look at the problem differently and propose solutions. As LLMs get more powerful and are easier to fine-tune we'll see such systems tackling larger problems. The other thing is having LLMs with larger contexts so they can hold say 100+ files in context and whole issue trackers as they work through refactoring and completing issues.I've been programming for over 20 years now and what current LLMs produce one-off can be quite surprising. Both ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 have a strong understanding of programming languages and concepts. A lot of software is not complex algorithms, but fairly mundane sequences of known techniques and the LLMs can do that just fine given their vast training. It's not a threat right now for programmers. I am seeing a lot of junior programmers use the tools to quickly learn different ways to write code. That said, the trends are there for these to do useful work. The time ranges we're talking about for computing/software advances to make these viable are very small. Like 10-30 years.","Umm... coding is language. Give Claude a coding task. You'll see why people are afraid.","Replace? Doubtful‚Ä¶ Help? Significantly. I‚Äôve used an LLM at work to generate code, that while seldom quite right.. is often 80-90% of what I want. It‚Äôs particularly useful if I‚Äôm not as familiar with the language. It gives me a useful direction to explore for how to implement, what libraries to reference, etc.","Do you have any coding experience or experience using LLMs for programming? You can test all of this for yourself today.","Long term coding jobs could be done. I liken it to self driving. My Tesla will mostly drive me places without me having to do much. But usually on each trip there's a moment where I \"intervene\". It might be small like I tell it to get out of the lane now because I know it ends up ahead, of maybe I choose a different route to get where we're going. It's not perfect but it's quite good, and a responsible driver can use it for a smooth experience. However, it's really, really far from being able to drive itself unsupervised. Hell knows when it will get there.Now to coding. Way back when you had to do everything in machine language. Then programming languages were invented to make us telling the computer what we wanted easier. Then tools would correct your programming typos. Now gpt in a lot of cases will write code for you, although a human programmer could probably do it betterWhen will get to where a non-technical person could ask AI to write code without the human being capable of supervising? I'm not sure, but I suspect it's coming quick. I'm old enough to remember HotDog as a webpage writing tool and knowing html being a valuable skill. Look at Square space and stuff now. It's phenomenal. How long till we have square space of c++? The boss of Nvidia just said he doesn't think kids should learn to code. He's biased of course, but what if he's right?","No, coding jobs will be around forever because you can‚Äôt trust a core business process to be modeled and developed solely by AI. No matter how ‚Äúgood‚Äù the prompt wrapper that is being included is.","So to answer this question we have to answer it more nuanced and answer two other questions first:1. What exactly is programming?Programming refers to the process of DESIGNING, WRITING, TESTING, and MAINTING code that instructs computers to perform specific tasks.Programms can reach from simple algorithms to complex websites and software applications which parts are mostly written in different languages and are communicating with each other via some kind of API.Programming requires logical thinking, problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and creativity to develop efficient and functional solutions.2. How do LLMs work?I think this is were most people still struggle. A LLM does not understand what it \"says\" it is nothing more then a very complex pattern matching algorithm.To explain it I like to compare it to compressing algorithms with loss:So when a LLM is trained it \"compresses\" all the textual data it is trained on but some of the information is lost.When we now give a prompt to the Model, it is like \"decrompressing\" a part of the data.This decompressing works very well for pattern it knows from its training data like simple Code snippest you will find on github, documentations, stack overflow, etc. The more specific your case gets the more unlikely it becomes that the decompressing works well. Till you are at a point where the model starts to hallucinate (to make up text) where it tries to match the prompt you gave with a pattern from its training data, like if you tell it to write a facebook clone or the google search algorithm.Final AnswerSo if we go back what programming is we can see that LLMs can actually only help in one part: WRITING. And even there only rather simple algorithms and Code-snippets you will find on Stack-Overflow or with a quick Google Search, so you still need logical thinking and problems solving to know how to split it up into manageble parts for the LLM.The value it creates is actually that if you know how to conceptualize your code in common language you it can write that code actually much faster than you. But you have to keep in mind that we don't know the quality of the code which is online. Most likely a lot of the code is unfinished or medium-quality.Also programming changes and depending on your requirements you actually want to use different languages, frameworks, technologies. If you dont know the jargon of the domain you will not be able to generate a meaningful prompt. A friend of mine is graphic designer and he is amazing with Dall-E or Stable Diffusion. But he sucks at generating meaningful code. He knows the jargon and is also much more creative in that sence than I am.So LLMs and Generative AI in general are amzing Tools which will and already help to increase productivity. What that means is that I have more time for the fun parts:Conceptualizing what I want to do.Conceptualizing TestsWhile the LLMs help me a lot with:- research- writing CodeSo programming will not die out but it is simply adapting to new Tools like in the past. Coding Jobs will not be replaced but will change with new required skills and Tool knowledge.","Most likely, they can replace coding tasks, not jobs","Code is language, bro. Read Snow Crash.

Look at Devin it‚Äôs already doing it.","One avenue it could replace programmers is to create a programming language based on English. When computers first came out, there was no code. It was all hardware. You physically built the program you wanted to run with transistors. To make things easier, we developed things called programmable logic gates, and you could use a programming language called machine code to instruct the hardware how to use these, using a one or zero to switch them on or off. Modern computer processors are essentially just billions of those housed together, and we have built modern programming languages that take what a person writes, in code humans can understand, and translate it to the ones and zeros the machine needs to execute a task. Programming languages keep getting closer and closer to human languages.
