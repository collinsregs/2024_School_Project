The NFL is getting paid $110 million to allow this game to be exclusively streamed on Peacock. That’s a lot of money for one game, so you can understand why the NFL is willing to lose viewers and “experiment.”For Peacock, the same is true but for a different reason: they’re trying to build up the audience to a paid streaming app that is losing billions of dollars in an era where people are dropping cable. A number of analysts have called Peacock a “struggling” service in an era where everyone is trying to figure out ways to generate revenue and audiences from streaming.","Yeah it’s trash they can do this"],"points":0},{"text":["Japan crashes SLIM spacecraft upside-down on the moon and calls it a \"success\"","It got there and is functional. Who wouldn’t call that a win?","They hit their target within 50ish meters, that’s insane. The accuracy required to land something that close to their target from earth is crazy, it’s also fully operational so I would also call it a success.","Any landing you can walk away from…","From the article: Its two rovers are operational, and the craft seems intact but is without power until February 1Japan's SLIM lunar lander crashed into the Moon last week. The \"Smart Lander for Investigating Moon\" was supposed to touch down on January 20, which it did. Unfortunately, it landed on its head. Japan's space agency still considers the mission a success.The SLIM was a joint effort between Japanese toy company Takara Tomy, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Sony, and Doshisha University to design a craft capable of \"super-precise\" moon landings. In that regard, it succeeded. Aside from landing nose first, the SLIM touched down 55 meters east of its landing zone (LZ). Usually, scientists are happy if they can land within several kilometers of their intended LZ.","Its just bowing to accept the moons business card.","Cuz it was! Congrats to Japan for sure","They deserve bonus points for an epic landing and it’s still working! Extra 10 pts for difficulty and style","Successful landing, everything in one piece. Unsuccessful, everything in pieces.","Sounds like a success to me. Fuck yeah!","Doesn’t matter, touched moons.","Click bait title","Well, yes… but also, no.","Yeah, well how many spacecraft have you crashed into the moon?","Task failed successful","Japanese spacecraft: thunkEveryone: “Sorry about that, better luck next time”Japan: “Are we a joke to you? Not ideal landing, but all is good”Everyone: “Wait… since when have you had the ability to make a spacecraft orders of magnitude more precise than ours… that can survive landing upside-down????”","The media’s complete inability to even remotely comprehend different levels of success especially when it comes to EXTREMELY complex goals such as spaceflight absolutely blows my mind.","Crashed or landed, you guess","being the first one to land upside down is great achievement","Certainly better than my attempt","A modern art masterpiece voila.","Job done.","Upside down achievement unlock..","Aint much but its honest work","OP is an astrophysicist with expertise in orbital mechanics so he (and its a he) can confidently judge and criticize JAXA's major fail of \"crashing\" their probe in the Moon, without any need for context and/or nuance ... 🤡","It was supposed to land on the back side.","More than I've accomplished this week.","To save “face”?","They got there.

I’d like anyone who’s judging them to prove they can do better because COME ONNNN","They did way better than my attempts.","They reached a specific location 243,000 miles away. We have people getting lost going to their car in a parking lot.","They also taught so much to everyone else. Learning from failures although expensive, is still learning. Imagine if Apollo 11 did that.","Who or what took this photo??","They probably landed on the South Pole of the moon so makes sense","Well, hell Ya!

Seemed like yesterday they were taking off for the first time. Time has moved so fast during these last 2 administration's.","God speed, you magnificent bastard. May future explorers recover your electronic corpse, and weep in the presence of your glory. 🫡","Amazing what NASA does in the same of furthering knowledge despite their funding being dangled like a carrot on a stick.Given that they get a fraction of a percent of the USA budget. I wouldn’t mind my taxes getting increased by 1% so long as all that money ends up funding NASA and their ambitions.","Since I was a kid in La Crescenta (right next to JPL), I’ve always looked up to the quality of the engineering work that comes out of that place. If I’m not mistaken, pretty much every probe/rover/helicopter has out performed its mission goals. Pathfinder was particularly influential for me… it landed on Mars the summer before I was applying for college and pushed me towards pursuing engineering.","Good robot.","NASA is very good about under promising and over delivering.
