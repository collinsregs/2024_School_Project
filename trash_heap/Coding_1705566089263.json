It references studies showing the limited impact of static types on bug reduction, compared to the more substantial benefits of Test Driven Development (TDD). The post also argues that while static types offer certain developer tools and can be useful, they provide a false sense of security regarding bug prevention. It concludes by advocating for TDD as a more effective method for reducing bugs while recognizing the ancillary benefits of static types. NOTE: This is not related to the actual summary, but this shows more that types have an effect on the wider programming market than an effect on a highly proficient team. So if you have control of the hiring, go for TDD and hire those skills, if you don't, typescript will probably be a great plumbing tape to get delivery going.If you don't like the summary, just downvote and I'll try to delete the comment eventually üëç"],"points":1},{"text":["Presenting 'forkrun': the fastest pure-bash loop parallelizer ever written"],"points":0},{"text":["WebAuthn - A Short Introduction"],"points":0},{"text":["Distributed Data Done Right: A Golang Journey with Consistent Hashing"],"points":0},{"text":["Oxlint, a future replacement for ESLint?","Here's the summary:The blog post announces the general availability of Oxlint, a JavaScript linter that emphasizes performance and simplicity. Oxlint is designed to be faster and more efficient than ESLint, capable of running on large codebases in seconds. It focuses on identifying problematic code without the need for extensive configurations. The post highlights Oxlint's significant speed advantage, demonstrated by its rapid linting of Shopify's codebase. Oxlint aims for ease of use with zero-config setup, leveraging Rust and parallel processing for performance. It prioritizes identifying erroneous or redundant code, and simplifies understanding lint messages. The post also notes ongoing work to read from ESLint configurations and considers future plugin system possibilities.If you don't like the summary, just downvote and I'll try to delete the comment eventually üëç"],"points":1},{"text":["Recommended inexpensive coding kits for newbie/age 10 and up.
