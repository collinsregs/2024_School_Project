Noone is saying anything about finger movement tracking.","please stop inventing more e-waste for the sole purpose of harvesting private data. what do i need a smart ring for?","","Whatever these rings end up doing please let them passively charge. Idc if it's solar or thermal or mechanically somehow but please don't make me take it off to charge more than once a month. Preferably I'll never have to.","Any editor who allows the phrase, ‚Äúto the next level‚Äù deserves to be fired.","Noone wants these things.

Anyone comparing them to other cameras need to understand this is not marketed to you, it's a plug and play system to easily stream/record multicam content. Think small sports, music performances, where you're not hiring someone to capture it but doing it yourself.","These micro43rds-in-a-small-box cameras can be popular with astrophotographers, just get a telescope eyepiece adaptor and then you can control the scope motor drive and take photos automatically from your computer.Mind you, I'd want to know more about this camera's spectral response and noise performance before buying one.","wow a grand for each sensor? naw no thx.","Looks like my 8 year old GoPro 5.","Did GoPro make similar camera?

There are enough breasts on the internet, we really don‚Äôt need statistics of more.","How much does that cost?","Boob science leading the way!","Does it have a built in radiation unit for making clear pictures? Ooh, and for the USA: does it detect swelling normally related to pregnancies, so we can incarcerate mothers to make sure they give live birth?","\"Bra company explained the 36gb data uploaded was individual case, normal users usually range from 12kb to 24mb of data usage\"","That would be amazing for me because every other day when my breasts hurt I‚Äôm panicking that I‚Äôve got breast cancer","There is no way it boosts survival odds. Early detection of breast cancer is a myth. If it were true, death rates would have plummeted when the mammogram was invented. We have a slight decline in breast cancer deaths due to survival rates increasing because of drugs. In 2016, I was told I had 30 months. I‚Äôm not dead yet.Only stage 4 is fatal. No one dies from stages 1-3. A full 30% of people with breast cancer are stage 4. That number has not moved at all.

Put a creep alarm in it!","So stupid","[deleted]","Given the cost of a well built bra, I can't imagine this would ever be in any way affordable or practical. Even as a medical device there are much better ways of going about this.Plus imagine the anxiety. It's bad enough out here without getting a titty alert, go to the doc, and oh, you're ovulating so yeah. Or having to cancel an alert cause you took a nap wearing the bra and your boob crept out of it.Perhaps this could be a step to a different, more practical tech, but this ain't it.","Next up: period tracking panties.This is beyond creepy","Surely there's now way adding one of these to your daily life is good for your mental health","This is not a recognized method for detecting cancer, I'm not saying it's a sham but it is far away from properly approved methods, I also imagine it's gonna be expensive, so I have a hard time understanding the use case for this. Is every woman expected to buy a boob scanner that hopefully works and use it regularly? Is that better than a visit to the doctor once a year? There's gonna be a lot of people that won't use it correctly, what do you do about that? Are you going to just trust that everything was done correctly?
