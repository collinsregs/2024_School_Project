Fact is great teachers quit every year. They are also not easy to come by. Just look at the ratios. Great teaching has nothing to do with incentives. Great anything has nothing to do with incentives. Great anything is a matter of principle. It is the desire to pursue mastery.Debugging as a skill requires more that ‚Äúwe learned eclipse‚Äù or ‚ÄúI can set a break point‚Äú or ‚ÄúI can set conditional break points‚Äú or whatever else people in this thread mentioned.To say debugging is about using the features of a particular debugger, is like saying my skills with MS Word make me an author.No. Those skills with MS Word also don‚Äôt make me an editor. What makes me an editor is my ability to recognize what is helpful feedback and what is not. That‚Äôs teaching.Most people are not able to do that. Most people will latch onto grammar and spelling when they try to edit. If you ever tried to teach writing, you know that doesn‚Äôt matter or that such feedback doesn‚Äôt educate. Great writing isn‚Äôt achieved by being grammatically correct or demonstrating your spelling skills.Teaching is hard. Understand that much, and maybe you have a chance of understanding the whole of the situation.Probably, students could be taught how to debug software, but there is more to the skill than being able to set conditional breakpoints and run some debugger compatible code to experiment with possible solutions to the problem.Knowing the details of a debugger just gets you started with what‚Äôs possible. Debugging is another skill. It‚Äôs like knowing how to drill, saw, and glue wood.

If they teach you problem solving, then the lesson you would've taken away would have been more successful and widely applicable than a specific subset of tooling!Hope this helped.EDIT: If you're saying not in grade school, but undergraduate - I'd be shocked that they wouldn't have taught you to debug your code in addition to writing it in a programming course.

They are very different. Coming up with new algorithms and computer architectures is very different than making software.The article is not about debugging, though, it is about not teaching fundamentals before moving on to material that requires it. E.g. not teaching editing, but teaching writing, or not teaching algebra when teaching engineering. I am not sure I agree with the premise of the article as I did learn those things in school, just not in university. A better statement would be that universities should review fundamentals, such as rules for using a comma or algebra, before moving on to more difficult subjects. Which I sort of agree with, however, I recognize that given the limited time that universities have to cover a curriculum and the fact that college students can and should be expected to review things on their own, I don't think it makes sense to have it as part of a core curriculum. Perhaps, they can have a list of review text books or chapters to go over before a section is started.","Because compsci is not programming","Because they fundamentally don't understand it.They don't need to.The product they are churning out are students, not functional code.","I remember being shown a debugger, but getting good at it requires experience and practice.

Most complex apps I‚Äôve worked on have the fundamental secret sauce that does the useful work that is the core of the program, but that is useless until people can actually leverage it.Of course, there are hard computer science / math problems that are theoretical and people spend their lives working on these problems, but the overwhelming majority of programmers are basically doing CRUD apps with some business specific processing and enforced rules.","WTF does that image have to do with this post?","I‚Äôve seen a lot of interns come and go.

It has been a while since I've been in school but I recall doing it in multiple classes.My issue has never been with them not teaching fundamentals, I've always felt like I had a good fundamental base. My issue, after getting into the real world, is how little of the real world they teach you. They don't tell you that you're going to have insane deadlines or requirements change at the last minute. They don't tell you the vendor is going to have broken pieces you have to figure out. They don't show you someone else's sloppy code and expect you to work with it. They don't teach you that you're going to spend time in meetings solutioning things with business people that don't understand the technicalities of the code.

It itself needs debugging.What I‚Äôve observed from the interns we hire, most have some experience using a debugger. None have experience using a profiler.From interviewing though - use of a debugger tends to arrive late in curriculum. Students suffered with a lot of console printing before being introduced to a proper debugger. Not that I think this is a bad strategy - there‚Äôs many languages that lack debuggers (or a system you‚Äôre working on has none installed) so knowing how to debug code without a debugger is still a valuable skill.","My school certainly did. Took an entire class on assembly language also... that gets into the nitty gritty of CPU instruction sets, IP and stack, and exactly what is going on when you run and debug a program.But yea... there was a lot of \"real world\" programming that didn't get taught.

Most commenters here have taken this to mean \"university\" or \"college\", but IMO these days fundamentals should be taught in high school.","The amount of people I work with who don't debug, don't know how to debug, and/or don't write code that can easily be debugged. They don't have a high output, but I don't understand how they get anything done.","I think the author is simply wrong in their premise.If a person doesn‚Äôt know fundamentals of a given field, and particularly if a larger group doesn‚Äôt, teach those fundamentals. I‚Äôve taught commas and semicolons to students almost every semester I‚Äôve taught in college, and it‚Äôs neither time consuming nor hard.I remember suffering through this in junior high. Some people convinced the teacher that they had never heard of \"nouns\" before, like it was a completely new word to them, and the entire class was stuck doing remedial grammar. It was a WASTE OF TIME.If this guy never heard any complaints by teaching commas in university, then they either weren't listening, or students simply didn't complain because they were happy to take an easy grade or just skip class to do something else.I know I didn't bother taking extra time to complain about my few poor professors individually.They write for a few minutes then I walk around and look at their answers and offer a bit of individual feedback. Ideally, I have some chocolate and give the winner or sometimes winners a treat.LOL this guy is a professor? Sounds like a primary school teacher. Every single one of my university professors packed their lectures with content. Even in my softer electives (sociology, psychology, English), none of them ever used lecture time for students to do work. The closest we'd get is class debates, which is not equivalent.Now, I agree with some of his other points that the profs shouldn't be dismissive of students that need to improve their understanding of some fundamentals. But the solution for them is to get support outside of class, not to drag everyone else down to the lowest common denominator. The prof sounds like he is from the generation that came up with participation trophies and No Child Left Behind and \"can't give a kid a zero even if they didn't hand in the assignment\" mindset.And as for teaching fundamentals, my university didn't teach basic things like \"programming languages\". You were expected to pick that up on your own. Then again, this was a computer engineering program, not a software development program, so the focus was elsewhere. I could agree with the idea that some more formal instruction on debugging could be useful, but that's really what the labs and assignments are for, not the lectures. I don't think you can learn a lot about such things from a lecture. You learn by getting experience and doing it and needing to do it.I don't really get why this article was posted to programming. The article seems to barely mention debugging or anything really specific to programming, and debugging is only mentioned once in the article.","It's not the school, the board is full of old, really old people.","I know when most people ask me for help I just show them how to debug properly, and then they don't ask for help as often. I feel people just don't see the value in it. I debug pretty much always even if it's just to understand a piece that I don't know helps me see the flow better and how things are being executed.I don't know as much about other IDE's but in Android and the Android Studio IDE, we can write conditional bugging. So say you have a bunch of elements and you just want to catch a specific one that is failing you can do like if myObj.title = \"corn\" inside of this debug line and it would only ever stop when it meets that condition. it is super powerful.","At my school, it seemed like most of my perfessors had never worked in the industry or were 30 years removed. One professor was getting his doctorate while teaching. He was clearly a modern industry pro, and he was the best professor I had. He was the only one to teach any debugging.","They definitely teach it. I question if it is very effective. I am also willing to challenge how effective and representative they can actually make it? Education and the IT world have some alignment. However it is far from perfect. My major shock was the difference in scale, different teams and way‚Äôs to access resources. It is hard to replicate this while also using individual grading. From group projects I remember there always being ‚Äúpassing with distinction‚Äù, ‚Äúpassing decently‚Äù, ‚ÄúJust passing‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù mentalities.

You also don‚Äôt want the deadweights to drag the others down or even fail.","My uni had a course on testing, and testing II as an elective. Most people didnt take the II course because there were other courses that were just more interesting. But the testing course covered debugging as well. It was sort of theoretical but we did have some basic exercises with python.","They do, or at least they should. The issue is debugging doesn't have a recipe. You just draw lines in the code trying to separate what works from what does not until you reach a piece small enough that you can see the issue.That can take many forms, and depending on what you debug can be done in different ways, it really comes down to practice, experience and finding what works for you and your style of programming.I do a lot of architecting so i am obviously biased, but my mantra has always been good architecture and good separation of concerns will make debugging much easier.The biggest issue is when code is monolithic and bloated such that making one change breaks 3 other things down the line.Imagine you have to write some code that needs to draw a square, you can try to do it all at once, or you can split it up:1 base class that can draw straight lines1 that can attach them perpendicularly ensuring right angles1 that can determine if 2 lines are the same lengthIf you need to debug and notice your lines are squiggly, it's obvious where the issue is and it should not affect anything else when you fix it. It's alo much easier to write tests for each and you can reuse the code down the road for other shapes.That's probably more important to teach than actual debugging and i feel like this is what my school focused on a lot.","Debugging by David Agans is the best book I‚Äôve read on the subject. All new grad hires are provided a copy to read and it‚Äôs probably more practically important than anything they learn in university.","One year out of college I couldn't believe I wasn't taught to use a debugger.

As we converted each page into React, we replaced the original page with an iframe containing the React app. The React app was smart enough to know if it was embedded and do things like hide the nav menu (the legacy app had its own), get the login token from the PHP app, and make sure cross-app links worked as expected.New functionality was built in React, but legacy pages remained in PHP until we either had time to convert them, or the business requested significant changes to a page.Business requests came first, and we only converted pages as we had time.","Key points:The article discusses the challenges of large-scale code refactoring in busy companies, emphasizing the need for a well-planned and inclusive approach. Traditional refactoring often results in rushed processes, feature freezes, and potential burnout due to lengthy and unexpected delays. The article advocates for a more intentional, long-term strategy involving the entire team from the outset, leading to numerous benefits such as reduced stress, improved ownership of the refactor, efficient pull requests, uninterrupted feature development, and gradual implementation reducing QA issues. The process, based on Chernyak's experience with multiple big refactors across different companies and teams, includes essential prerequisites like having an experienced software engineer with a clear vision and a diverse team. The method involves identifying refactoring patterns, preparing the codebase, creating clear and specific instructions, keeping refactors visible to the team, and integrating them into regular workflows. This approach, contrary to working in isolation, fosters team collaboration, reduces confusion, and allows refactoring tasks to be self-assigned, ensuring everyone is aligned with the decisions and direction of the refactor. However, it requires patience, as refactors can span years, and parts of the code may never be refactored, which is often justified.
