Tadaaaaah.But whether that's the best solution is tough to say. Will that dark background expand when content is injected ? What is the content ? Text ? Will those dividers logically separate columns ? (then rethink above suggestion and draw onto the corners of a the container element of choice).Either way, its not really a React problem, its a matter of first semantically structuring what you want to show in HTML, then thinking whether pure CSS can meet this design using your DOM structure, if not, then you can look at something else (SVG is likely the easiest in case the lines are static and wont expand to match dynamic content height)","Table borders if you want to have fun","100% height div with a left or right border applied to it.

What they wanted me to already know was the 1.5 times IQR stuff (statistics) but I completely forgot since I last saw it 8 years ago.What I did instead was describe what an outlier could be, and for each type of outlier I described also wrote a function in front of them to show that I can at least execute on defined problems. Along the way I explained some of the gotchas of the functions I was using (pointing out contradicting argument orders) and also describing other ways I could have written the function and why I'm writing it this way.I think I turned a situation where I didn't know ONE specific thing and turned it into a showcase of how I actually knew MANY things and was willing to be flexible in my execution.Got that job (though now I am again laid off as the company failed).","Fail often, it makes it not feel bad at all.

The interview system for programmer jobs is entirely screwed up. You can be Linus Torvalds and still be treated as a junior developer in an interview. You could even have been more than qualified and still get turned down for a ridiculous reason. If I remember correctly, the guy who created Homebrew got turned down by Apple for not being qualified, even though engineers at Apple use his software (I know this for a fact). There's also a lead engineer for a major JavaScript framework who told me he got turned down from a Silicon Valley job (can't remember which one) because they believed he wasn't qualified, even though his code supports countless production applications.In your situation, I would have just told the interviewers that I'm feeling anxiety and that I'll do my best. If trivia questions are more important than 15+ years of experience or who you are as a person, then screw 'em. If I'm interviewing someone, I don't even ask such questions if I can avoid it. I think it's more important to get a sense of what kind of coworker they will be and how they approach writing software (without the help of things like Copilot). But many software engineers don't think this way. To them, the interview process is a game of one-upsmanship until they decide to hire someone for an arbitrary reason. That's just how it is sometimes.As someone who's done some fairly non-trivial mathematic tasks in coding projects, and whom has written software for one of the biggest employers in the world, I've screwed up on coding challenges that other programmers believed were appropriate for an interview. They say that it's not the answer that matters, but that's usually horseshit. Most programmers are not skilled at interviewing but can hawk corporatisms while they judge you on things that don't actually matter. It's gonna happen to you and everyone. Work on your anxiety and hopefully you'll have better luck with other interviews.","I‚Äôm sorry for that. A better job interview would come along. Just go over what caused you to flop at the interview so it won‚Äôt be a hinderance next time.","I find that it helps to remember that interviews work both ways. You aren't just being interviewed as a candidate, you are also there to interview them as an employer. This takes some of the pressure off of you, because it's not just you that has to give a good interview, the employer has to give a good interview too. You may not hold the card that gives you the power to decide if the employer makes an offer, but you do hold the card that gives you the power to decide if that's an employer you even want to work for. Take some of the pressure off of yourself in interviews and throw it at the employer instead.","That happened to me once. I wasn't even in the market but got approached by a headhunter. It would be a slight raise, but nothing massive.I didn't prepare much. Didn't think a lot about it. Honestly, they didn't even tell me what to expect. Started the zoom interview and it was going fine. Talked about stuff I've worked on, blah blah blah.Then their JS guy comes on. He looked exactly like the guy from the WoW episode of South Park. You know he's the kind of guy who has done nothing but JS for 15 years. He starts asking me questions. Hell if I know the answers to any of them. I'm bombing, and he's rolling his eyes at me (on a zoom with 6 other people). It was freakin horrible.Last the SCSS guy comes on and I nail all of those questions easily (as that was what I was mostly working on at the time). But of course the damage was done.I just wanted to shout at the JS guy, \"I DIDN'T EVEN WANT THIS JOB! YOU GUYS CAME TO ME!\"Hang in there.

Don't beat yourself up, get back in there, learn from this interview, and try again. You may have to redevelop that muscle, and it may take a few interviews to get into the swing of it, but allow these interactions to motivate you versus persuade you to think negatively. It's not always easy, and anxiety does suck, but you will get there, we have all experienced this, you are not alone.","I wouldn't sweat it too much.Unfortunately an interview is designed and guided by people, and people are fallible, it's possible your interviewers were more interested in knowing the lingo or getting a basic problem correct first try.It's also possible that you were able to demonstrate sufficient understanding and were just feeling too anxious to answer those questions you bombed on as well as you would have liked and the interviewers understood this, and took it into account.Without going into a song and dance about what a good interview is IMO, I'll just say, I'd hope it's the latter and you really shouldn't beat yourself up too much :) Keep lining those interviews up and get out of your own head a bit, don't worry too much on knowing exact terminology, if you know your stuff you'll do well representing yourself.","Yeah I went through this too. I hadn't interviewed for 10+ years and bombed I think 3 interviews in quick succession. I swallowed my pride, filled the gaps in knowledge that were exposed during those bombs and got 3 offers from the next 3. Interviews in this field are not about what you know but about how you can answer contrived questions about nothing.","Isn‚Äôt the purpose of solving these questions to find how you are approaching the problem instead of examine your ability to solve within a timeframe ?","Thank you to everyone who responded.Sometimes life just sucks and having people say, \"yeah, it does suck sometimes\" is extremely validating.A very sincere \"thank you\".","10 years in the industry and so many interviews. Soak in that embarrassment and use it as fuel. You‚Äôll start to feel better soon. Interviewing is bullshit and anxiety makes it so much worse.

It's less than 15 lines of code.Take the rest of the time to think about the problem, how it might grow and change over time, how new fields or content types might get added, where you would store them, how it would change your code, how you would handle multiple languages, and then work your solution to accommodate those things, and explain to them how you and why you got to those conclusions.If this is the kind of thing that you all think is too difficult to get done in 3 hours then you're definitely not ready for that job.","Maybe I'm just missing something, but what they're asking for here looks incredibly basic and I'd imagine would/should be possible in three hours.

But at least where I work, our API calls are no where near instant so they definitely improve things.","Sometimes designers put a lot of work into their spinners and want people to witness itSeriously though there have been some studies to show that people will trust a service more of they need to wait a few seconds. Usually things like insurance quotes, flight comparisons, etc. The reasoning being that a search cant possibly be that thorough if it resolves immediatelyFor almost all cases it's not desirable though, and usually it's because there is actually something going on in the background that takes some time","You need to understand human psychology to understand why spinners are absolutely relevant and necessary. Humans want things done fast but are too skeptical when something is done too fast. Imagine you go to a restaurant, order a burger, and 5 seconds later they give you the burger. You would be very skeptical and start to question the burger, right? It‚Äôs the same.A loading spinner gives time to the user to take a step back and relax mentally. When you fill out a form, especially one that has sensitive info, you are performing a mentally challenging task (e.g. making sure the passport number is absolutely correct). When you submit, you need a few seconds to ease off and just chill. Giving an immediate response can cause further stress.From a technical point of view, not every website uses the best technology and server set up. Most websites cannot (and do not need to) be blazing fast. So most users are used to 1-4 seconds of waiting.From a marketing point of view, the delay might be to some tracking/analytics code running in the background.It‚Äôs true that sometimes we need to intentionally slow it down as in the example of debouncing and throttling. When you are performing an AJAX search, you don‚Äôt want to get results the moment you type a letter. You wanna wait some time before making the API call because users do not type very fast and change their mind mid-action.","Does whatever you do always load instantaneously in all instances? If so, then no, you don't really need the spinner.But if there is ever a case where there is a delay, for any user, for any reason, the spinner can be useful to indicate to the user that something is happening but just not fast enough. A big one might be form submission, there might be some front end validation and then some processing and then a redirect, but you don't want people to think that nothing is happening even though it only takes 2 seconds. You don't want them trying to spam submit, so maybe you'll disable the button or at least make it look disabled. But then users might think nothing is happening and it's broken. Hence the spinner to say \"I'm still working\".As /u/08148693 said though, a big reason is still the legacy trust issue. Older demographics often times, still won't accept how quickly things can happen. The mentality of how slow tech should be, or how long something takes if you are through, affects their perception of what's happening on the site. For us, if something is slow we take it as \"man this site must be coded like shit, it's slow slow, IDK if I trust it.\" For them it's \"that was too fast, there is no way it can be accurate and that fast, i don't trust it\". As that generation is removed, the need to \"slow things down\" will start to reduce over time. When you look at the zoomer and alpha gen, they expect everything to just be near instant. Millennials and older gens still remember how long it took for a single jpg to load over dialup.I still use them for AJAX form submissions since it's relevant when waiting for the API to respond. Or when waiting for a large image to load as a placeholder. But for just basic page loads, I don't use them at all.","Am generalising here:Outside of tech, things work or they don‚Äôt. In the physical world, for every action there‚Äôs a reaction.We‚Äôre hard wired to expect a response. No response = monkey brain says broken.So we give people a response, that response is just ‚Äúwait‚Äù.It‚Äôs the same as seeing inside a vending machine. There was a study we studied during my Human Computer Interaction masters degree that said vandalism dropped (including anger) when folks saw inside the machine and could see their order coming.There‚Äôs a whole field to this","A spinner or loading bar complements your existing UX. If I click \"Submit\" on some form, these are some of the things that help users understand that the thing is interactable and the click triggered an action:Cursor become a pointer on hoverThe button change color/highlight on hover/focusThe click/trigger should disable the button (or the form) to prevent secondary submitsThe button should change in some way to indicate the request was submittedA transparent overlay appliedA spinner/loader shown to indicate that the action was acceptedA success/fail/warning notification when a response is received (or a toast)Overlays/spinners/loaders/disables removedA noticeable change triggered in the GUI to show the relevant information was updatedAnd while that sounds crazy, there's been times where I've clicked on a button on a website, and I sat there waiting for several seconds only to realize that the site had a JS error and failed to submit the thing I sent. At the same time, I've seeing UIs where the UX didn't do any of the above, and I did multiple submissions of the same data.","Yes, we do.At least something that says \"I'm not hung\"/\"still working\" in some form. Be that a progress bar, changing words(Windows updates is doing this), a whirly-gig, it doesn't matter just something that shows things are happening.","Yes.Sometimes things aren't instantaneous and we don't know how long it will take. Adding a fake loading bar or spinner is a great way to reduce user confusion and let them know \"yes, the thing you did is in fact doing a thing\".Users are not patient. They never have been and the fact that tech keeps getting faster only makes those moments when things don't happen instantaneously all the more painful.","Yes. Very yes. For the consumers. We as consumers need to see that something is in the works even if it's a lie. It's a psychological thing that just shouldn't be ignored.Consumers are the one buying into what you make. If you don't follow what they are comfortable with what's already out there and is working, you're just shooting yourself on the foot that could've gathered more user base.","Most are there for a reason.

Like some of the others have said I guess it does boil down to familiarity and social psychology: we can't truly trust something instantaneous because it is foreign to our more primitive understanding of the world. However, we are primed to expect things more quicker nowadays, with attention spans waning and all, yet we hold on to these outdated mechanisms because we have a subconscious reservation to change.Though I'm sure there are some instances where a loading/progress bar is genuinely reflective of an ongoing background process which does not load instantly or near instant, though I don't know enough about them to offer an example, sorry.","Yes","Yes, imagine ChatGPT is responding to you with a blob of text in 10 milliseconds, it would feel fake and weird.Also same goes for high value things such as transferring $10000. You probably expect the latency to be at least 1 second. If it instantaneously completes, would feel weird.","The 3 second delay and spinner/loading bars are separate issues.It can be a good design choice to add a short delay and some sort of visual indicator of activity. You do want the visual feedback that something is or has happened, and that'll be missed or jarring if it's only there for like 50ms. The visual indicator and even a slight artificial delay can actually make things feel faster, and give the user a sense of progressBut 3 seconds is too long","I do tend to implement them but more to indicate that something is actually happening. An overlay that fades in (and out) to not make it appear out of nowhere but blocks inputs, a rotating thing so people have the impression that something is happening. A combination of slow servers, poor networks, slow devices and other issues could cause people to become frustrated and/or submit data several times. It's better to prevent that.","Yes, they're still needed. Sometimes back-end calls or API calls take a few seconds. I'd rather see a spinner gif telling me that my request is processing instead of nothing happening.","I don‚Äôt know if there are scientific tests on this, but I‚Äôve definitely seen casual / unscientific situations where we put a spinner on something, and people perceive that the site is faster and more responsive when it shows a spinner while loading.

It‚Äôs lightning fast and the format is basically identical. In some cases you do want something to appear (even briefly) to indicate something has happened. Loading spinners and pop up‚Äôs just happen to be the easiest implementation of this kind of feedback.","In short:Psychological Comfort: Users often feel more at ease when they see a visual indication that something is happening, especially in processes where actual loading time is unpredictable. This prevents the perception that the application has frozen or crashed.User Experience Consistency: In complex applications, some tasks are processed quickly, while others take longer. Using spinners or loading bars consistently across the app can maintain a uniform experience, setting a standard expectation for interactions.Perceived Performance: Interestingly, in some cases, these indicators can create a perception of thoroughness or sophistication in the process, which might be important in applications where trust and reliability are crucial.Guiding User Focus: Loading animations can also be used to strategically direct the user's attention to certain elements once the loading is complete, enhancing the overall flow and interaction with the application.","Our users complained about very slow load in some pages where the backend queries take a long time as they're going through a lot of data.I managed to eliminate all of those complaints just by adding some UI loading state on some particularly slow requests where there was none before, as well as making our search page async from the frontend rather than pausing for 15+ seconds before serving the page and results, even though the slowest queries take exactly the same amount of time to resolve.As long as people can see that their request has started, it's okay if it takes some time. What's really important is how quickly they see a reaction to their click, and that it doesn't look stuck or frozen","Click a button that waits 2s and then loads new ui.

And there are lots of jobs you can migrate into after working as a developer for a while (team leads/managers, project managers, business analysis, and so on).Also are you sure? Maybe you are having a case of imposter syndrome? What did you mean by \"flaws\" in this statement \"I can‚Äôt build huge apps without flaws ...\"?","Being ‚Äúgood at programming‚Äù is only like 50% of the skillset needed to be a stellar employee / coworker IMO! I‚Äôd prefer to work with people who: - Are proactive - Can explain complex topics simply - Can create detailed documentation and communicate decisions and trade-offs clearly - Can give and receive feedback in healthy, positive ways - Can effectively debug, clarify, and simplify code they didn‚Äôt write - Aren‚Äôt assholesYou‚Äôd be surprised how many ‚Äúgood‚Äù engineers suck at these things üëÜ","I've been a professional developer for almost 5 years now.Every day I suffer from imposter syndrome. I think I have no idea what I'm doing. I lucked into my jobs.But I get good reviews, I get good raises and promotions.I don't know if I'll ever be good. But as long as I'm being paid I try to be content.","Absolutely! There's all sorts of web developer jobs out there. Some will only require you to build templates with very little programming. All depends on the company size and project you are working on. Just find what you are good at and a matching role for it.","There's a big difference between not being great at programming and liking it still, and being not great but hating it. You talk about your motivation dwindling so maybe coding just isn't a passion of yours. There is nothing wrong with that at all. There are a lot of other fields in tech you can look into that you may really enjoy. Or who knows, maybe you'll learn to love programming and be motivated to really get good","Okay in what sense? If you want to earn a living doing this you do need to show ability to do the work.","Huge apps with flaws, published by big(ish at the time) companies, is how I got my foot in the door. I found flaws/bugs/missing features, and I wrote code and sent it to the companies with a note explaining the how and why. This got me consulting gigs, which funded me starting a real business.It's not for everyone, and it is probably getting harder as people and tech advance, but don't feel bad about making big apps with a few flaws. Or even taking time to make a site that works and looks good. Trying and doing are better than giving up or never starting.","Get a real human to look at your work and help you figure out which jobs to apply for. You might be applying for things that never even get to anyone. Don't send out anymore applications until you have a plan.","Looking good will take less preference than finding internal bugs in my opinion.It seems you put more stress on presentation (as per your post) which probably is narrowing the time testing the app and finding the internal bugs.My advice, change priorities and bring design+integral part to balance in terms of spending time.","\"I can‚Äôt build huge apps without flaws on my own while working a full time job.\"Not even entire departments/companies that employ hundreds of developers can develope huge apps without flaws. Programming isn't about being flawless.\"My websites I can build take me a while, but look good.\"That's honestly better than most.General advice: it sounds like you need to shift gears and do some interview-prep instead of building more side projects.","\"skill level is only so high, and my motivation to keep pushing for higher quality is going down every time I see a job posting and get ghosted\"‚ÄãThen you are boned. A downward spiral. Nobody ever got good at anything by talking like that. Is this the way you usually handle difficult situations?‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãBut, seriously. You have to change your outlook. TOP has a very good section in the course about the programmers/learners mindset. You are experienced and know what you are doing apparently but it may be worth a read anyhow. Dig, you will find it.","i dont think theres a actual way to be \"good\". you just gotta learn the basics and if you dont meet up to anyones \"standards\" on how you should program and you think you're good enough than keep it in your mind that you are good for your standards.","Yes it‚Äôs ok . Sadly you have to do well in interviews or be a culture fit in your interview .","As a general advice:Don't even bother contemplating. Just keep an open mind and learn from your shortcomings and you'll look back at your old self with a smile.","Big companies can't build huge apps with no flaws. There's bugs in everything. Sometimes they just get hidden better.","Of course, it's perfectly okay. Programming is about solving problems and continuous learning, not just building huge apps flawlessly. Your progress and the websites you create are valuable. Remember, every developer has a unique journey and skill set. Keep going at your own pace ‚Äì your dedication and ability to learn are your greatest strengths. The right opportunity will recognize and appreciate your unique contributions. Keep believing in yourself!","You don't have to be the best, you just have to better than yourself 6 months ago.","Some day you will be great at programming.You just need more experience.","Bootcamp grad with 7YOE, major imposter syndrome, I‚Äôve somehow survived the last 3 rounds of layoffs","This sounds like a personal insecurity issue, to be quite frank. You inherently learn and grow as you continue doing stuff, and to think that that won't happen as you continue for years doing this I think reveals something else inside you that needs work. It's not your skills that are in question. I think you might want to talk this through with someone dear to your or a therapist. No disrespect intended. But insecurity, and imposter syndrome as a whole, is a real thing that needs to be handled and will affect every aspect of your life, either negatively or positively.","None of us are good at programming.","I have met only a handful of ‚Äúgood‚Äù engineers in 20 years or so. You will be fine.","The only bar that matters is the bar that you set for yourself. Focus on what you are good at and let your strengths and accomplishments speak for themselves. Depending on where you go and who you talk to you might hear otherwise, but quality is superior to quantity. That may not be what some employers want to hear, maybe they want both, but that doesn't mean you need to worry yourself over what you are bringing, over what you can provide. Take it at your pace.There is some employer, some company, some job, some position that requires exactly what you bring to the table and you'll excel at it. You just have to find your niche.This mental adjustment applies to so much more than just programming, it affects all aspects of your life; which, I might add, all contribute to your programming abilities/limitations. It all requires moderation and balance and driving yourself into the ground for not being \"good\" enough certainly won't help any ambitions, programming or not.At the end of the day the only person you are competing against is who you were yesterday. If you can say confidently that you have bested that person, then you are not only making progress, but you are on your way towards achieving your goals.","Is it okay if I‚Äôll never be ‚Äúgood‚Äù at programming?Of course it is. As long as you are okay with it.","As long as you fine not getting paid for it","I've found a lot of serenity in using either AI assistant from Jetbrains or Github copilot. My assistants now manage to keep up with the latest best practices and are kind of my ever-present mentors while coding. If a new version comes up I can ask them what I need to change in the code to make it better.","It is tough with other full time commitments, I sympathize with that. Keep trying to find areas where you can improve, and build SMALL projects that display these skills. Make them small so you can realistically finish them. But design them well so they don't look amateur hour.Also, don't make these stupid landing page \"projects\" for imaginary companies (I see this all the time from shitty bootcamps.) Basic html & css aren't skills to write home about.
