The more people in your network that you engage with the higher your chances of standing out and being \"luckier\" than others. Knowing one or two specific people with influence is always a benefit, if you don't have such contacts yet, aim to identify who could potentially become them and align some of your efforts to impress them in particular. Be realistic about your chances, and never do something that is contrary to your overall success/strategy. There is an old saying \"If you want advice, ask someone for money, if you want money, ask them for advice\". This could apply to internships a bit, too.CCNA and CTF/hack challenges as start to career pathsYour choices here are appropriate for someone looking to be on the engineering, architecture, design, IHIR, SOC, DevSecOps and many other career paths. This is a well trodden entry level route to a solid career and you maintain your options while getting highly relevant experience even for non on-prem environments. HAving the CTF challenges too means you are going as deep as anyone else at your stage and you keep the more offensive security paths open too.SIEM software choices for home labIn general, use FOSS, go as low level as you can with tools (BPF is not too low!). A good combination of tools, the setup of which alone is useful for a home lab, is Security Onion (there is a free version). pfsense for the gateway, try and include non virtualised boxes in combination with virtualised nodes. Aim to get at least to a stage with a labyrinth and a honeypot alongside the ability to detect, prevent and investigate using established methods.Getting internshipsIt's about differentiating yourself from the crowd, so building up the networking to have a broader and deeper audience, building up your online profile by doing the hack challenges, attending meetups, contributing to the open sources community in any way you can, showing enthusiasm and passion for the subject, and keeping a journal in public (at least partially if not fully) of your experiences, observations and progress can be a good tool in this regard.Having got some profile to refer to, a 3-pronged approach to your internship can help: (1) understand what hiring managers actually care about (2) identify when they are hiring and what for (3) identify at least 2 ways to contact them outside of the job-application procedures/systems - since you are asking about internships, and willing to potentially be unpaid. Always remain humble, positive about what they are doing, and offer to be helpful wherever you can, share your profile, and say you have no demands/expectations. Even then you will need volume to get opportunities, but they will happen if you remain consistent.Good luck !","Cyber is hard to get into as a fresh grad.

(Chromium security severity: Critical)\" Describe how the adversary can exploit this vulnerability on a host system.\"**RESULT*\\*The description of the vulnerability involving a heap buffer overflow in libwebp as it affects Google Chrome versions prior to 116.0.5845.187 and libwebp version 1.3.2 points to a classic web-based attack vector. The critical severity rating from Chromium's security team suggests that exploiting this vulnerability could lead to serious consequences, including arbitrary code execution, system crashes, or information leaks. Here's a breakdown of how an adversary might exploit this vulnerability on a host system:Crafting a Malicious Web Page: The attacker starts by creating a specially crafted HTML page designed to exploit the heap buffer overflow in libwebp. This would involve embedding WebP content that, when processed by the vulnerable library, triggers the overflow. The content would be crafted in such a way that it overruns the buffer boundary allocated for the image data.Enticing the Victim to Visit the Page:Next, the attacker needs to distribute the malicious page. This could be done through phishing emails, social engineering, compromised websites, or other methods designed to convince the victim to visit the URL containing the exploit.Triggering the Vulnerability:When the victim visits the malicious page using a vulnerable version of Google Chrome, the browser attempts to render the WebP image. Due to the heap buffer overflow vulnerability in libwebp, the malicious content overflows the allocated memory buffer.Executing Arbitrary Code:The critical aspect of this vulnerability is that the overflow can be designed to overwrite specific areas of memory with arbitrary code. The attacker can craft the payload in such a way that it injects and executes malicious code on the victim's system. This code execution could occur within the security context of the browser, potentially allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access to system resources or sensitive information.Exploitation and Post-Exploitation:Successful exploitation could enable the attacker to perform a range of malicious actions, depending on the nature of the payload. This might include installing malware, creating backdoors, exfiltrating sensitive data, or moving laterally within the network to exploit other systems.Mitigation strategies for this type of vulnerability typically include updating the affected software to a version that patches the vulnerability. In this case, users should ensure their Google Chrome browser is updated to version 116.0.5845.187 or later, and any direct usage of libwebp should be updated to a version beyond 1.3.2. Additionally, employing good security practices, such as using web filters, anti-exploit tools, and educating users about phishing and other social engineering tactics, can help reduce the risk of exploitation.","Adversary hosts a malicious webpage then tricks the victim into navigating to said webpage where the exploit is then ran in the browser.Browser = Pwned.","Also the scoring system v3 has some detail worth checking into about how to decide between multiple AVs if more than one apply.

Randomize that MAC lol.","Steal the soap bar and a towel to compensate for your job.","Pretending to be concerned about how to responsibly disclose this issue as a cover for bragging about what wouldn’t qualify as “hacking” is embarrassing.","Saw the same thing at an apartment complex I was staying at a while ago, I changed the WiFi password and enjoyed the bandwidth just for myself lol","So you basically found an unlocked car with the keys in ignition, you got in, drove around the block and left it in the same spot.","Hotel won’t care, or the 200IQ reception staff will and call the police because you’re an evil Russian haXor sent by Putin and logging into the mainframe. No good deed ever goes unpunished.I would have just reset the password to something random forcing the IT guy to factory reset it in 5 years time.I’ve logged on to wifi and seen public shared drives with sensitive hotel information in it which was actively being used. Best way to solve this is legitimately download 5GB of cat photos and fill the shared drives with it so someone notices.Sometimes to be white hat you have to be grey","No one cares","Change the password for them to stop future issues for customers.

The threats are different, mostly nation state or advanced because of the isolated nature. There’s also some insider threat sprinkled in, although these are usually idiots not spies. Because of the these reasons the job security is better and pay is usually better because of old tech and the necessity of the systems uptime. There’s typically physical consequences for system downtime. You have to know your system / primary function as well as the threats - professionals coming from enterprise IT won’t be able to walk in the door and perform without some adjustment. As far as certifications the CISSP still carries weight, if you’re into SANS the GICSP is a great option as well.I think the idea of getting general cyber experience is a great idea, obtaining knowledge of NIST 800-53 and possibly even hands on technical experience (lab/real world) of older operating systems or embedded systems is also a strategic endeavor. Can’t stress the importance of soft skills as well - Communication and Teamwork, translating topics to leaders, etc. Good luck!","I'm new in the OT space, coming from IT so this is just my observation thus far, take it with a grain of salt as I'm still learning. They're very, very similar. There are two distinct differences: (1) the consequences of a breach/threat actor exploitation is much higher in OT and (2) the threat actors in OT tend to be more state actors as the payoff requires quite a bit of investment on their side because of the age of some of the technologies (though as things are being replaced, the OT environment is becoming more homogeneous making it less costly).","I used to work cybersecurity on aircraft and then ship based systems.  I left that for cyber focused software development because it was very heavy on travel.  I loved the work, but it was hard on my family.","I enjoy OT cyber because it matters. It’s not some stupid product or social media. It’s power, water, medicine, etc. The pay is good. Generally, better than traditional IT. As far as job security goes, it’s about as stable as you could ask for. It seems like nothing is stable right now, but people will always need critical infrastructure. The SANS trainings are good but pricey. If you can get someone else to pay for them then that’s perfect. 410 is a bit too basic. You could replace 410 with free training from CISA on their website. You can and should use the free training from the government such as the ones from CISA/DHS and DOE. Look into ICS red vs blue. It’s free and amazing. Same for DOE CyberFire. The only problem with the free classes is that they can be hard to get into.","I work in both, but I enjoy OT more. Granted I was an industrial automation engineer prior to going into cyber security… but OT security is in a massive growth stage and both I and most governments feel it has been neglected and needs attention desperately. Cyber security is a wide range. Go after what interests you and will keep you excited to keep at it. If you already work around OT, dive into that. The SANS courses are great. Of all the courses I’ve taken, theirs were the most enjoyable and beneficial. Do it in person, participate in the Netwars (CTF) and other night time training and sessions.","If you want to try out OT training prior spending a lot on SANS, check out 301 and 401 trainings here: https://www.cisa.gov/ics-training-available-through-cisaWhat do you do now? I started cyber doing security assessments now assessments are heavily focused towards OT systems. For the future, OT cyber may benefit you well. It's a still small community where you will keep bumping into the same folk at conferences. I think we are seeing a trend, at least I am, where it makes sense that more critical infrastructure regulations will be coming sooner than later.
