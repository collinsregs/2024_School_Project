But this means you need to restart the PC every time you want to switch OS.\n\nYou could have 2 devices and a desktop KVM to switch between them to switch between them. This will double the cost as you'll need 2 machines and a KVM. Or if the 2nd OS is fairly light (eg a linux distro) you can run it on a raspberry pi which are fairly cheap.\n\nYou can run a VM inside your machine. I know you said you don't want this but this is probably the closest you'd get to running 2 machines simultaneously and being able to switch between them.\n\nIf your machine can't run a VM, you could look at running one in Azure or AWS for a cost, similar to the pros and cons of the VM above.",

This allows you to update the final/destination URL the user is redirected to at a later date.\n\nIf you use QRFY to generate a static QR code, it should just link directly to your website or whatever you tell it to point to and the QR code should never expire or deactivate.\n\nIf instead you use QRFY to generate a dynamic QR code, this means that whoever scans the code will first be directed to a link on the QRFY website and then QRFY will redirect them to whatever your chosen URL is (which you can update later).\n\nIn the case of a dynamic QR code, you are entirely dependent on the platform (QRFY) to redirect users to the correct URL and they can charge for this service. If you don't pay, they can simply decide to stop redirecting users to your chosen URL. There is nothing you can do to get around that. The QR code will permanently point to QRFY and you have to depend on them to get people to the right place when they scan the code.\n\nNon-profits can get special pricing.

There's only one switch on that bus and it's between the X2 and SATA 4/5 connectors.\n\nHave you tried unplugging the cables to SATA 4/5 and plugging the USB card into the X2 slot?

This file system has that 4GB limit on files that it's able to store.\n\nIf the file has to go on this drive, it will need to be reformatted.\n\n!!! This process will delete all data on the drive !!!\n\nCopy everything you wish to keep from the drive to someplace safe (or multiple places).\n\nOnce your data is safe, open \"This PC\" in the file explorer, right click the drive (make absolutely sure you've got the right one!) and select \"Format\".\n\nexFAT is the file system I'd pick - it doesn't have this limit and works well on Windows and MacOS. Most modern devices should support it. The only reason you'd want to keep using FAT32 for mass storage is if you have old equipment that can't read exFAT volumes.\n\nThe alternative will be to download to your boot drive, which will be NTFS and will also handle the large file. Then you can split it with an archive tool if you really must.\n\nIt's possible that there exists a dedicated download tool out there somewhere that can split as it goes, but I consider this an XY solution",

It's readable on macOS (but not writeable unless you purchase a third-party app) and kinda usable on Linux (it might refuse to write if you take out the drive from Windows without using the safe removal menu, or reboot to Linux without disabling Fast Boot).\n\nIf you can afford to backup and format, exFAT is nice since it's supposed to work with pretty much any modern OS and even portable devices, but if it's not a flash drive and instead is a partition on a USB HDD/USB, remember that resizing exFAT partition can be very annoying (much easier to just backup everything, delete the partition and create new ones)",

But I need to vent.\n\nI went down this road of data hoarding by building a media server. I’m really just trying to make sense of what is going on with these HDDs.\n\nI have now gone through 2 sets of Seagate EXOs 18TB drives (new from Amazon). Neither worked in my machine. I returned them.\n\nThen I went to microcenter and picked up 2-18TB WD gold drives. No luck spinning. Brought them back to microcenter and they confirmed they were dead. I sat there at microcenter watching them proceed to test their inventory for a functioning drive. They tossed out about 5 of these WD Gold drives before finding two of them that worked. I brought them home and they aren’t spinning.\n\nOn top of that, I have 2 of these used drives (one of which I discussed in my original post) which also don’t appear to reliably work.

If it still works right then it's probably fine though.\n\nHowever, especially if you have a cheap SSD, you should minimize how often you do this. We regularly get people on here that bricked their cheap SSD by doing this. Kingston explains why that happens. If you don't properly shutdown an SSD its firmware metadata can be corrupted, causing data corruption, or worse, a failure of the firmware, bricking the drive.\n\nIf you have quality SSD though, then the risk of this happening is pretty small. They have much better firmware and more protection against metadata corruption.",

Employee-only wifi obviously links to your identity.\n\nAre you asking this because you connect to mainstream porn sites/social media, torrenting, copying sensitive data, or sending a whistleblower email while connected to the wifi?

A cool feature with Microsoft accounts is then you can go passwordless along with the standard QR codes for standard 2fa. I also actually use a second app that I self host but that’s just me being a nerd.\n\nIf you just want to stick with the Google auth and account, when setting up the 2fa it should offer a set of recovery codes.

It's not really a great indicator, but if it is fine and works with just the CPU stressed (but still continues to shutdown in gaming or something, where something like a GPU is also pulling a bunch of power, stressing the PSU more), then it seems less likely to be a CPU/Motherboard issue and more likely to be a PSU one.

I assume PSUs will slowly reduce in 'headroom' a little over time, but if it's rated reasonably well above how much you're drawing, and has been working fine all this time, then I wouldn't really put much stock into it.\n\nAlthough something worth noting is that GPUs can have transient power-spikes well above their listed power/wattage numbers; which I assume can trip PSU protection-circuits if they're borderline able to handle the listed numbers. So if you can get the issue to reliably happen with something like a GPU stress test (¿FurMark?), then I would think it's likely to be a PSU 'problem' as such (although it might not be faulty, just not able to handle the GPU's transient power-spikes).",

If you don't have any zip software installed, right click on the folder and select Send to → Compressed (Zipped) folder.\n\nUpload to any easy to use file sharing site. Reddit keeps blacklisting file hosts so find something that works, currently catbox.moe or mediafire.com seems to be working.\n\nWe like to have multiple dump files to work with so if you only have one dump file, none or not a folder at all, upload the ones you have and then follow this guide to change the dump type to Small Memory Dump.

Not only would it solve your main problem but you'd get a lot of other benefits:\n\nA lot of security burden (although NOT ALL) will be taken off you\nIf your security gets compromised anyway then only your cloud environment is in danger instead of your house network.\nYou won't have to deal with hardware issues, excessive downtime, etc\nYou'll have tools like snapshotting that will make recovering from disasters a lot easier\nIf you want to experiment with a new type of service (which it sounds like you enjoy doing) you can just quickly spin up a server, do your experiments, and then tear it down when you're done. No having to fuss with imagining a bare metal machine or any of that mess.\nEvery server gets its own Internet-facing static IP which makes managing the networking side of things WAY easier\nIf your server suddenly has a surge in traffic you can click a button and it automatically has more resources to accommodate it.\n\nYou mentioned you're running some stuff in containers - a lot of cloud providers let you just run containers as-is without even needing to put them on a dedicated server at all.\n\nSeriously, look at what resources your current setup actually needs (NOT the total amount of resources your machine physically has, but what resources the services are actually using) and then price out what it would take to get those resources on a Digital Ocean droplet or something.

Or 3 triple AAA launch games, a deposit for a package holiday, blocks of driving lessons. it does add up. I think your dads being nice and trying to give you the hint to power down your devices overnight without having a confrontation about it.

You need to figure out why you can't sleep. There's too many possible reasons including medical than I could possible hope to armchair diagnose here, but you need to figure that out. And your dad needs to figure out how to do parenting right. Your account is two years old, minimum age to be on reddit is 13, so you are a minimum of 15 years old, that's too old to be lied to about stupid shit like this.\n\nYour father should be saying \"I'm turning off the internet after midnight so you will go to bed at a reasonable time\". He should not be lying to you. 15+ years is more than old enough to be honest with your child.\n\nAnd if he does truly believe he's saving 50€ a month with this, you and your brother should be seeing some of that, 20€/month each sounds decent ;)",

(Like returning to your laptop after taking a break only to find that your laptop decided to p much shut down on it’s own despite being charged (if I came back to my laptop within minutes, np, but if more than an hour or so, every time it would shut down), and now you have to turn it back on (hit the power button and have it boot up when I should have just been able to click a button and have all my work right there as I left it before sleep/hibernation), and pray to God that whatever you had open saved/is recoverable, or any issues with heat?)\n\nI went to tech support from MicroCenter several times for the same issue. They tried multiple things. One of which was taking my hard drive out and putting into a new same model laptop. Another was changing the settings of hibernate and sleep. Another was some Windows issue testing (they actually found a problem with windows and that’s why they decided to take the hard drive out and put into a new same model laptop from off the shelf. The problem yet persisted and in the end they p much said to just get a brand new same model laptop with store credit and start anew like total clean slate. Meaning I have to set up everything all over again and that took me days!! (this is considering I have my files backed up to an external to transfer over) … And I have work to do rn!!! So now I’m trying to resolve this concern and avoid having to deal with this issue any longer I can’t it anymore it’s been weeks and it’s affecting my health with where I’m at rn. I just want to do right please if anyone can help it would mean so much I’m sorry if this is stupid\n\nThank you all so much for your goodness",

Integrate the extender in the mesh, so that you dont have two wifis with the same ssid and passkey, but have one wifi with different sources (your phone etc. will connect to the one with better signal).",

Although you may want to be careful, as q-tips can get snagged on small surface-mount components, so don't rush things or be aggressive around those tiny little components and accidentally pull anything off.\n\nIt's worth noting it's not uncommon for there to be oily looking smudges around solder points, which might just be flux residue from when it was being soldered (depending on how it was assembled). That residue isn't harmful, but you can clean it up anyway just in case.",

Or it did until I went in there.\n\nPLEASE READ EVERYTHING in the following 2 paragraphs before doing anything.\n\nVery basic question - have you tried unplugging and plugging it back in, in both ends? Usually it's a loose cable into the port, but there could be a bend (and subsequent crack) in the cable itself. It could have gotten dislodged by an object falling onto the cable and pulling it ever so slightly. My father had a paperweight actually fall and pull it out of the socket just a hair.\n\nWhen you go to unplug the cable, don't just \"yank\" - actually feel whether the cable is loose and and has give, or if it is tight in the port.",

Either from the Windows Update history or manually? It's entirely possible that you're experiencing a bug caused by the latest driver, that didn't exist in the prior release.",

If you have a nearly full hard drive it might be a reason, or if you have a virus - run a full scan of MS defender and download malwarebytes and run a scan with that as a first step.\n\nReinstalling windows could be a good idea, but post more info to help with the diagnosis, that's probably a powerful system that shouldn't have any slowdowns.",

Big games make your computer work hard and get hot. Make sure it's clean inside and all fans are working.\n\nAlso, update your graphics card drivers. Old drivers can make games run badly. Go to the website of your graphics card and download the latest drivers.\n\nLastly, use Task Manager to see if your computer's parts, like the CPU or GPU, are working too hard when you play.

This is a feature of most models of Intel CPU. (AMD CPUs do not usually have this feature.) This way, you can use the computer without needing graphics hardware- useful for servers or other light tasks that don't require GPU power.\n\nThis device is accessed primarily through the motherboard's HDMI ports, but you can also instruct the PC to use that device by default.

Some google searching shows many people unhappy with the audio capabilities of that board when it comes to compatibility with certain surround sound systems.\n\nLooks like your options are to try your luck with an optical cable but that will probably result in only a stereo signal at best.\n\nI owned a first generation Xonar DGX which remains my favorite sound card to date. But it had a similar quirk to what you are describing. Some of the first gen DGX did not play well with official drivers and it would cause driver corruption that would result in audio crunchiness, lagging and crashes. I would have to use something like DDU to clear out the old audio drivers using the audio driver uninstaller part of the program. Then reinstall the drivers again to regain functionality. Then I found the UNi XOnar Drivers, unofficial drivers, that worked much better. I don't use it anymore but it still was my favorite card.\n\nIf you cant wait or get audio through the optical try cleaning out the old audio drivers with DDU. Reinsert the card and try clean installing the official drivers. Hell, try those UNi Xonar drivers if you want to.",

To configure 7.1-channel audio, access the audio software for audio settings.\n\nSo using their realtek audio software, it sounds like you can repurpose the jacks for 5.1 or 7.1 audio however if your mic is analog this will sacrifice that to get surround sound working.",

A lot of software follows some general conventions about where they put their data.\n\nThere's a big advantage to doing this, if you separate stuff like user settings and data in the right place you can avoid accidental deletion and different instances of the same program can access the same files.\n\nLook for a 'portable' version of the software you need. Often times there's either an official or unofficial version that can be simply dragged and dropped onto a USB drive, and which has been specifically designed to keep any persisted data in the same place as the program.\n\nBut if there's no portable version, you'd have to resort to something much more advanced like creating a bootable USB stick with it's own operating system that you can then load on other machines.

Reddit keeps blacklisting file hosts so find something that works, currently catbox.moe or mediafire.com seems to be working.\n\nWe like to have multiple dump files to work with so if you only have one dump file, none or not a folder at all, upload the ones you have and then follow this guide to change the dump type to Small Memory Dump. The \"Overwrite dump file\" option will be grayed out since small memory dumps never overwrite.\n\nI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It looks as if Techno Intelligence uses fake SATA SSDs and cheap Timetec memory and NVme SSDs, then charges the retail price for these \"upgrades.\"\n\nThe only positive from this experience, which wasted some 40 hours of my time, is that now I'm proficient at opening up laptops and changing parts.

I also read that if your WiFi network has both 5GHz and 2.4GHz bands under the same SSID, the card tends to connect to the 2.4GHz band, which further reduces the speed. Not sure what else to say, but I’ve dealt with unstable cards like it seems to be the case now, and I’d probably have tried switching it out for a different model.",

Then I could switch between the two in Windows? The only issue is that although my KVM does have a sharing port, my monitor is currently using it. I could probably just use a USB hub to fork off to my monitor and the DAC and whatever else needs to be shared. Would that work?",

Let's say it shows up as /dev/sdb\n\npvcreate /dev/sdb\nvgcreate mynewvg /dev/sdb\nlvcreate -n myvol1 -L 3G mynewvg\nmkfs.ext4 /dev/mynewvg/myvol1\nlvcreate -n myvol2 -L 2G mynewvg\nmkfs.ext4 /dev/mynewvg/myvol2\n\n\nBinary math when doing things like that sometimes doesn't quite add up 2 + 3 != 5. So, the last lvcreate, could be of the form:\n\nlvcreate -n myvol2 -l 100%Free mynewvg\n\n\nThen create your mountpoints, edit your /etc/fstab and mount. Obviously what I just said is something many people do. You could have some sort of automount arrangement or other thing happening that actually mounts the filesystems.\n\nBonus: I'm out of disk space on /dev/sdb.\n\nBeen awhile since I've used the \"workstation\" product, more familiar with VSphere. So, I'll present two approaches. The first one is more generic and will work with most anything.\n\nCreate new disk in VMware, let's say it shows up as /dev/sdc\n\npvcreate /dev/sdc\nvgextend mynewvg /dev/sdc\n... you now have more space to create more LVs\n... you could grow existing LV as well\nlvextend -L +1G /dev/mynewvg/myvol1\nresize2fs /dev/mynewvg/myvol1\n\n\nThe other technique is to grow the existing PV disk, /dev/sdb. Assuming you can do that in your hypervisor, and assuming you can do that while the VM is up:\n\necho '- - -' >/sys/block/sdb/device/rescan\npvresize /dev/sdb\n... you now have more space to create more LVs\n... etc.",

You won't have to look up the new one when things stop working. It will just resolve to the new one each time so long as you are running an update client on your end.\n\nAs for security, it depends on what firewall features you have on the router doing the port forward. The same IP address issue applies here as did above, you'll have to know theirs to enforce strict whitelisting and theirs will likely change over time. You could restrict it to ranges in which theirs are in. For example you can lookup the IP they currently have on ARIN and it will tell you the block it belongs to and the owner. You could whitelist source traffic from those blocks, or even more narrow pieces.\n\nIf you want to be as secure as possible, start strict with the risk of it not working and relax restrictions only until it works...then tighten again 😂.",

There are complex methods of cryptography (TOR for example) that use encryption and random path generation to obfuscate the original source and final destination but that's way beyond this conversation lol.\n\nAs for a go-to set of things, my best advise is a fundamental approach. Less = More.\n\nYou are allowing traffic inbound to your network, so with that comes some risk. Now how much, from where, etc.\n\nA lot of what you'll be able to do will depend on the firewall engine in the router you're using, but at a basic level you should be able to enforce source restrictions. If you can get your friends to send you their IP addresses (IP Chicken is a good lookup tool), you can restrict it to specifically those or those ranges. Depends on how much you want to be changing. If you restrict it to Jon's IP of 1.2.3.4 for example, and his IP from Bob's Internet changes to 1.2.3.5 then Jon won't be able to login until you update it.\n\nNow I'm going to throw more dirt in the water...ALL of that is assuming they are directly connecting to your server and not via cloud proxy service such as Steam or GOG. You'll likely need to allow more than just your friend's IPs inbound in a lot of cases. It really will be specific to the application your hosting.",

If a single tab can be used to go to a VB-AUDIO pipe, you can add the pipe to OBS and just mute the output in Windows.",

The data center hosting the VPN service is very very fast to the point that the only bottle neck is the path to and from the client and the VPN server.\n\nISPs will throttle connections intentionally at the local level, regional level, and national level. It keeps service fair for most users but isn't always ideal.\n\nA VPN provider (say Nord VPN) will route traffic to a very close server that then routes the traffic to the target VPN server. In a sense you're going from 8 hops on a slow route to 4 hops on a very fast route. Even though there are more steps involved, the servers involved with routing have insane levels of bandwidth thereby providing fast speeds and low latency.\n\nThis isn't always the case but if OP has moderate to severely bad internet they could see an improvement.",

This will be represented in the rated TBW figure, you may have noticed this.\n\nA higher capacity drive of the same model is going to have a higher TBW rating - scaling roughly linearly with its capacity - solely by virtue of there being more cells to spread the wear across.",
