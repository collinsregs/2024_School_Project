Which will totally keep functioning throughout a nuclear holocaust!”)\n\nOne thing that interested me in the Matrix was that, even after conquering the humans and capturing them down to every man woman and child, they still tried to act humanely by plugging them into a VR paradise world where they were always happy and every need was instantly met. Turned out that human brains were just so primitive and lizard-y that said paradise made them go insane, so they had to invent the flawed, dystopian Matrix because it was the only thing our minds could accept as real.",
