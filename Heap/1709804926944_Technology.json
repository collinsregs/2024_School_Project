        "comment": "Why? I already asked AI how to prevent school shootings:\n\nPreventing school shootings is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach, including policy changes, community engagement, and individual action. Here are several strategies that can contribute to prevention:\n\nEnhanced School Security: Implementing security measures such as controlled entry points, security cameras, and on-site security personnel can help deter potential threats.\n\nEarly Intervention Programs: Identifying and providing support for individuals who show signs of distress or violent behavior can prevent escalations. Schools can implement programs that teach conflict resolution, stress management, and emotional regulation.\n\nComprehensive Mental Health Support: Increasing access to mental health resources for students and staff can address underlying issues that contribute to violent behavior. Schools can provide on-site mental health professionals and facilitate connections to community resources.\n\nSafe School Environment: Creating a supportive and inclusive school culture can reduce bullying and alienation, which are risk factors for violent behavior. Schools can implement anti-bullying programs and promote values of respect and kindness.\n\nResponsible Gun Ownership: Advocating for laws and policies that ensure responsible gun ownership and restrict access to firearms by individuals who pose a risk can help prevent school shootings. This includes background checks, safe storage laws, and red flag laws.\n\nCommunity Engagement: Encouraging collaboration between schools, law enforcement, mental health organizations, and community members can foster a united front against potential threats. Community members can be trained to recognize and report concerning behavior.\n\nThreat Assessment Teams: Schools can establish multidisciplinary teams to assess potential threats and determine appropriate interventions. These teams can include educators, administrators, law enforcement officers, and mental health professionals.\n\nTraining and Drills: Regularly conducting active shooter drills and training for students and staff can prepare them to respond effectively in an emergency. However, it's important to balance this with the potential psychological impact of such drills.\n\nPreventing school shootings is a societal challenge that requires cooperation and commitment from individuals, communities, and policymakers alike. By implementing these strategies, we can work towards creating safer school environments for all children.",

Millionaire German guy who was neighbors with the Tesla founder in Tahoe.\n\nThis was well before the Gigafactory or even the Model X, I’d say when his cameo in Iron Man was considered cool.\n\nHe had nothing positive to say about him. Basically boiled it down to being an ego driven money guy whole claimed credit for the things other people did.\n\nSound familiar huh? On an even smaller scale anyone who knows basic labor laws could spot the Gigafactory as a giant tax scam that decimated the surrounding rental market ever since by hiring people from Alaska to Alamaba unseen to take $20/hr jobs for 90 days and no ability to renew the work contract, only be hired (about 10% at most got hired) but it could 60 days for a decision and only 45 days in could people apply to be hired. All to avoid paying benefits like health care or… taxes? Hell, they even got hundreds of millions in write offs without helping the surrounding area in the least.\n\nIn short, Elon is a piece of shit.",

While GPT4 is at the top, we just saw the release of Claude 3 which is literally performing better than GPT4 in many types of tasks.

I will disagree to some extent\n\nThe reason is simple, yes, I think all of the most common controls should be on the wheel and stalk as physical buttons, not on the touchscreen. But other than that, obscure controls that aren't needed while driving are much better on a touchsreen. The reason? Because nobody ever reads a manual or where they misplaced it. Touchscreens actually allow intuitive way for people to access and learn about controls of their cars without a need for a manual or figuring it out. At least in theory\n\nI say in theory cause automakers really really suck at UX. It feels most of the touchscreens are second thought. It also doesn't help they use old unresponsive touchscreens that lag like hell",

Congratulations, you cannot.\n\nAll you can do it's not trying to change new tool, that essentially just well-known from 1980s mathematical formulas multiplied on modern computing power, but change people popular motivations for it use, by rise of Human Capital.\n\nFor example, so most people know Academic Logic (rationality) and Cognitive Distortions, Logical Fallacies, Defense Mechanisms (self/social understanding), and so were more inclined to win-win strategies (no-zero-sum games).\n\nIt's too much more difficult than imitation of \"AI control\"?\n\nThen it's your choice.\n\nAGI it's orders of magnitude more complex problem. All human history it functioned by principle: \"problem -> aggravated/uncomfortable problem, and so emergence of motivations for it solution -> solution of problem (after experiments with its repetition) -> lazy use of solutions information on any similar problems.\"\n\nWith creation of AGI mankind will have only one chance to do everything right.

Once an organization gets to a certain size, or obtains a monopoly, it can continue failing forward so long as the monopoly is maintained. In Google's case, Google doesn't see any serious competition from Tik-Tok yet and by the time they do they'll try to have the government ban it. The government itself is useless to enforce any sort of tech/cyber laws, and in this case must resort to generic business laws even though the imposed punishment will be marginal at best.\n\nThat's the bigger picture here: as soon as this guy is deported, the Chinese government will pay him for his time in jail and he'll be celebrated with stable employment for himself and his entire family. The US government can't ban that company, the profits it'll make from this, stop Americans from using that company's product, or even stop Google from hiring suspicious people. The government definitely won't stop the stolen technology from being deployed, even if it's in very harmful ways like weapons targeting.

While the lobby group has described its proposal as “ambitious”, Tesla said it had been openly discussed within FCAI that it would not cut emissions before 2030.\n\n \n\n“Tesla is both a member of the FCAI and represented on its board, so it’s important that Tesla makes clear its disagreement with the submission made by the FCAI to this review, and with false claims it has made in the public discussion of vehicle standards.”\n\nThe FCAI’s claims that the price of the most popular petrol and diesel cars would jump by thousands of dollars under the government’s plan has been adopted by the federal Coalition, [describing] the policy as a “family car and ute tax”.\n\nA vehicle emissions standard is not a tax. It requires car companies to meet a per kilometre emissions target averaged across all the new cars it sells in a new year. The target would lower each year.\n\nTesla’s submission included a critique of calculations the FCAI has given to media outlets including News.com.au, the Daily Mail and Channel 9’s Today Show that suggest the government’s preferred efficiency standard design would substantially push up the price of 18 of the country’s 20 top-selling car models.",

I have a PhD , 15 years experience at startups and top tier big tech places, have won awards, published a book, and taught university CS for years.\n\nAlmost every single interview has been the same:\n\nRecruiting screen.\n\nCoding screen.\n\nSeveral-hour take home project, like building a full stack web app with persistence, an API, a react front end, etc. Must be on GitHub and run with docker compose. Must be written in golang or whatever.\n\n1 hour presentation about the architecture of said take home project, with 30 mins of q and a. Must include test coverage visualizations, discussions of alternatives, tradeoffs, and \"lessons learned\".\n\n4-6 hours of virtual onsite, including much more challenging coding (leetcode stuff usually), system architecture (design Uber or whatever), and a bunch of behavioral stuff (tell me about a time when...)\n\nThen if you make it through ALL THAT, they want you to block out three days so you can fly to HQ and do a full day actual onsite.\n\nThis has all been for remote work. At companies no one has EVER heard of, ever.\n\nI don't expect anyone to take my resume at face value, or not do due diligence. I know how painful false positive hires can be. But I've sat on the other side of hundreds of interviews at multiple FAANGs and without fail I would know what my recommendation was going to be within the first 5-10 minutes.\n\nThis process is ludicrous. I cannot even begin to imagine how someone does this while being employed. Of course, being unemployed, I am juggling some absurd number of these at once, so I'm exhausted, struggling to schedule things (give us all your availability for the next week, and hope that by the time we actually pick some times two days later, those times are still free), and watching cash trend toward zero.\n\nI've finished several of these loops recently and am optimistic that this shitshow is coming to an end, but am seriously considering telling wherever I land that I can't start until May just so I can fucking recover.",

This usually takes the form of questions like \"why are manhole covers round,\" or \"how many piano tuners are there in Los Angeles,\" or \"how would you build a house for a blind kangaroo?\" They are paired with the idea that it's less important to get \"the right answer\" and more important to demonstrate a thought process. Breaking the problem down. Calling out assumptions. Building on previous progress, etc. The problem is that no one really practices assessing answers to these problems. It's arrogant to believe you can just go into an interview and learn anything meaningful about how someone else thinks just by observing them trying to answer a question like this. There is so much opportunity for unconscious bias to take control of the outcome that this sort of question probably does more harm than good.\n\nThe Esoteric Minutiae Question. E.g. \"how do you swap two ints without using a temporary variable\". Interviewers love to believe they are gauging how deep a candidate's knowledge goes, but they are fooling themselves. This sort of question is easily memorized. If the candidate doesn't know it, well, maybe you've learned that they don't remember how bitwise xor works. But if they get it right, does it reliably inform you that they do? Does it even matter either way?\n\nThe Brain Teaser Question. These are questions that make people feel smart when they know the answer but really don't tell you anything about how well a candidate can perform a job. E.g. finding a counterfeit coin using a balance, or getting a fox, a chicken, and a bag of grain across a river. People may try to justify that these questions gauge how well a candidate thinks outside the box, but they really don't. You can think outside the box for days and never get the right answer. There is no algorithm for finding the right answer quickly. You can't really tell anything meaningful from the fact that one candidate got the answer quickly, another got it slowly, and a third didn't get it at all.\n\nJoel Spolsky had an essay called The Guerilla Guide to Interviewing. One of the key points was that you wanted to hire people who are 1) smart, and 2) get things done.\n\nThe problem is that people created all sorts of insane interview processes around trying to determine these two things, and no one stopped to ask whether they were actually getting high quality answers to these questions.\n\nThe scatterplot of interview outcomes to on-the-job success looks like a Jackson Pollock masterpiece.",

But there's people out there who are becoming very seasoned at this through repetition and clearly have some sort of system set up that they're honing.\n\nThe thing is that the ChatGPT responses are often pretty good about the theoretical and about best practices. So you ask someone, \"I see here you've worked on a cloud cost optimization project at $FOO. Tell me about the project, what your role was? What were the success criteria?\" And then they'll feed that to ChatGPT and you'll get a response that really strong on the theoretical aspects of such a project.\n\nBut then I have to really drill down and see what their practical experience was on the project (if any). \"Ok, that's great in theory. But I've been through several such projects myself, and I've found that product teams aren't usually keen to help out because the cost doesn't fall to them, it falls to the infrastructure team. How do you get them to care?\"\n\nA candidate who is using ChatGPT will just give a more elaborate version of the \"theoretical\" answer.

Companies are using terrible “AI” systems to vet candidates ahead of time before ever getting to a one on one interview. On the other hand candidates are using a host of new tools to combat this like real time voice analyzers that have read your resume to prompt you with answers. \n\nThe hiring process has always been troublesome, and the last 20 years have been terrible. However, this seems dystopian as hell. What really strikes me more than anything is the stunning lack of human interaction involved. It’s being led by companies but to combat it applicants are forced to reciprocate with similar tools and methods. \n\nI’m in tech and the older I get the more convinced I am that human interaction and social skills are far more important than any technical capability. This trend is going to seriously impact our individual and organizational level abilities to be adept at those critical skills and I hate the thought of where this is going.",

VMware officials said that the prospect of a hypervisor escape warranted an immediate response under the company’s IT Infrastructure Library, a process usually abbreviated as ITIL.\n\n…\n\nBroadcom, the VMware parent company, is urging customers to patch vulnerable products. As a workaround, users can remove USB controllers from vulnerable virtual machines, but Broadcom stressed that this measure could degrade virtual console functionality and should be viewed as only a temporary solution.\n\nThese are some problematic vulnerabilities, especially given how many (potentially poorly maintained) legacy installs there might be at this point.",

In that time, he saw the tool generate images that ran far afoul of Microsoft’s oft-cited responsible AI principles.\n\nThe AI service has depicted demons and monsters alongside terminology related to abortion rights, teenagers with assault rifles, sexualized images of women in violent tableaus, and underage drinking and drug use.\n\nAll of those scenes, generated in the past three months, have been recreated by CNBC this week using the Copilot tool, which was originally called Bing Image Creator.\n\nJones was so alarmed by his experience that he started internally reporting his findings in December. While the company acknowledged his concerns, it was unwilling to take the product off the market.\n\n \n\nJones said Microsoft referred him to OpenAI and, when he didn’t hear back from the company, he posted an open letter on LinkedIn asking the startup’s board to take down DALL-E 3 (the latest version of the AI model) for an investigation.\n\nMicrosoft’s legal department told Jones to remove his post immediately, he said, and he complied.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jones sent a letter to Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, and another to Microsoft’s board of directors. He shared the letters with CNBC ahead of time.\n\n“Over the last three months, I have repeatedly urged Microsoft to remove Copilot Designer from public use until better safeguards could be put in place,” Jones wrote in the letter to Khan.\n\nHe added that, since Microsoft has “refused that recommendation,” he is calling on the company to add disclosures to the product and change the rating on Google’s Android app to make clear that it’s only for mature audiences.\n\nJones said the risk “has been known by Microsoft and OpenAI prior to the public release of the AI model last October.”",

Even doing so much as having your bootloader unlocked (not even rooted!) is enough to trip it. Fuck that, with all due respect.\n\nAnd when Play Integrity isn't happy...a ton of stuff ain't happy. Android Pay? Nope. Any app that uses the API? Nope. And now Google's blocking RCS for devices that run afoul of Play Integrity. I don't think Apple even went that far on jailbroken iPhones, ever.\n\n(And yes, I know you can sideload apps. But the way Google's been going I wouldn't be surprised if they wished they could kill that off, too.)\n\nThat coupled with Google seemingly just having no direction as a company these days...I want to like Android. But I just can't, not anymore. Don't get me wrong: I tolerate Apple, but only just.\n\n(I figure if I'm going to submit to a locked down experience, I might as well...just go to iOS and get a long software support window and all the benefits of the iPhone ecosystem.

Banks are crying because they've always been able to see what you are buying with your credit card, and suddenly they can't. Their argument hinges on how Android lets anyone be a tap to pay provider. What they aren't saying is the only reason they want that is to funnel users into what's essentially a privacy nightmare.\n\nI don't mind options, but I also know that these snakes will not give us options. They will wrestle away control from Apple and then set up THEIR payment processor as the sole option the app/service accepts, which will typically be some random 3rd party provider you've likely never heard of.\n\nSo take it how you will. Apple's walled garden is a double edged sword. They charge a high fee which gets dumped onto the end user, but they also keep out the cockroaches.\n\nIf you want to hook up with a cheap prostitute, go with Google. People have been attempting to take back their privacy on Android and Google responded by breaking critical services on their devices.

NO\n\nDoes Apple comply with the EU ruling regarding the App Store? They say they do but the EU is currently looking at it before saying anything\n\nIs Apple tiptoeing around the certain EU rulings (App Store)? Definitely, and I don’t believe it’s correct but we can surely have faith in the EU on either making more rulings.\n\nCan Apple decide to not do business with Epic? Yes, as any developer on the App Store has to agree to the same TOS.\n\nLet me give an example: “just because you got kicked out of a store for doing something they might not want inside and you might not agree to it, doesn’t necessarily mean you can go back because you want to, it’s the store’s choice/rule”",

Definitely less work and bullshit than WorldCoin.\n\nIt's not decentralized, no blockchain nonsense, no shitcoin, no private company that amass the identity of everyone worldwide - and more importantly, no abuse by creating the perfect hub for marketing and stalking customers and their transactions. We already have enough tracking for marketing use-cases with Meta, Google and etc. - as a comparison - just imagine what would happen with Bitcoin if all exchanges that everybody can read from the network could be biometrically attributed to one identity just with an iris scan from a small orb.",

Apple once threatened to sue Android into oblivion with patents, until Google acquired the Motorola patent suite to counter Apple. There's literally no way any other company can enter and build equivalent hardware and software.

Lawsuits ensued, and the courts sided with Apple's monopolistic practices as being legal despite screwing over both Epic and consumers. Google's, on the other hand, just concluded, with opinions coming out any day now.\n\nIn conclusion: Apple is on the record as being antagonistic towards Epic trying to not play in line with their absurd cuts of the pie, and that's why Fortnite isn't available on the App store there. It could be a threat because of shady practices, or it could be a threat to their profits, which matters even more to them lol",

A ToS being ruled illegal doesn't become illegal from that point on.

It makes diddly squat to if the rule is illegal or not or if a punishment is legal or not for it.

Because you have bought things in the ecosystem, have data in the ecosystem which makes it very prohibitive to just leave and go to the other store and the devices you've already bought are only compatible with the one ecosystem. Everything about how your kitchen, your house, things you've already bought is digitally locked to keeping you with that store. If you want to start shopping at the other store you have to buy a new kitchen, and give up all the things in your current kitchen. Switching cost and inertia trapping people is huge.\n\nAnd the businesses supplying these two stores, they have no choice but to do business with Apple's store, or Google's store, because if they want to have a business they need to address the customers in your store otherwise it wont be a viable business. So what rules there are around the store and how much of a cut Apple takes become just the store getting to dictate and demand whatever it wants without any market forces or negotiation of opposing interests able to impact that. Apple has a pure position of power to just say our way or the highway, pay this much, do this, don't do that or you can't access these customers and your business is screwed.\n\nIn the real world if you don't like the terms you're getting from one store you can still reach customers by selling through another store. Or if the terms from all the big stores are bad and don't work for your business you can set up your own store and sell direct. Whereas if Apple's rules don't work for your business or they don't allow you in their store because of rules that serve their self interest you're just screwed because you fundamentally can't access those customers. So Apple has full power and this is not a functional market.\n\nThe analogy to real world stores breaks down. And this being scaled up to Apple getting to unilaterally dictate a 30% cut of a massive (but arbitrary) part of the digital economy (or extract that value in other ways such as with the core technology fee) and getting to set rules that make some businesses face an anti-competitive disadvantage (competing with Apple Music for instance) or make some businesses just not possible (things Apple doens't allow on the platform, business models that can't absorb the cut, etc.) it's really distorting the entire digital economy, what businesses are fundamentally possible, and what people can do with these vital to modern life devices and software platforms.",

You are well aware that's a bullshit price.\n\nNot in the slightest. 30% is a standard and used by Google, Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony. Funny that Epic has no issue with Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft though.\n\nPeople forget that Apple still has to pay for the bandwidth so that people can redownload/update those apps in perpetuity long after the sale was made.\n\nWhat in the almighty hell are you even talking about.\n\nA simple google search instead of an outraged reply would have answered that.\n\nApple used to charge for iOS upgrades prior to the App Store returning real revenue.\n\niPhone OS 3 was the last paid version.",

The latest security updates still apply to the iPhone 6s released in 2015. For comparison the Pixel 3a was released in 2019 and no longer receives updates. Google has pledged to support the newest Pixels for 7 years, which is still less, if they even do that.\n\nValue retention - if you do like upgrading every 2-3 years, you can actually sell your old phone for a decent value. Part of that value retention is the longer lifespan\n\nPixel 7 released in fall 2022 - $600 initial cost - current used value ~$150-$175\n\niPhone 14 released in fall 2022 - $800 initial cost - current used value ~$500\n\nSo is it actually over priced? 2.5 years of using a phone for $450 for a Pixel 7 or $300 for iPhone 14\n\nAs for repairability - people mostly don’t care. They either get apple care which costs a bit more but makes it simple or use a local repair place. It being harder to repair doesn’t effect them, it only effects the person they hire to repair it. Maybe it ends up costing them $20 more for a battery or screen replacement, but that’s only if they end up needing that.\n\nAnd for anti-competitive behavior - people also don’t care. People (partially rightfully, but not fully rightfully) like iOS being its own ecosystem. For a an average consumer it just keeps things straight forward and safe. Why would they care Spotify/Epic has to pay Apple 30% of their in app purchases.",

We took the time to validate this quant and flesh out one of the sub-themes from the OODA Almanac 2024 inspired by this “tipping point” – The Anti-content Movement: “In the deluge of content generated by AI, the human element becomes a coveted rarity, a beacon of authenticity in a sea of algorithmically crafted narratives.”\n\n​\n\n“We are fast approaching a “tipping point” – when non-human generated content will vastly outnumber the amount of human generated content: We are currently in an era where there is an unprecedented amount of data available. This abundance of data has far exceeded the volume of data that humans can create organically. Generative data, created by AI systems, is becoming the dominant source of content creation.”\n\n​\n\nAI-generated content, with its capacity to produce convincingly authentic material at unprecedented scales, introduces a new dimension to the concept of reality as we know it. The implications of this are profound, particularly when considering the potential for large-scale social media manipulation. The ability of generative AI to create content that appears genuine—whether it be text, images, or videos—means that the line between fact and fiction becomes increasingly blurred. This is not a distant future scenario but a present reality, with state and non-state actors already leveraging these capabilities to influence public opinion and political landscapes.",

Or make it like Android where anyone can sideload a 3rd party store without them\n\n​\n\nAgain Epic is fully in its ability to make a third party store for iOS. But Apple does NOT have to give them the tools to do so, they just cant block them if they do. If Epic can figured out what jailbreakers figured out a decade ago... all power too them.\n\nDo you even understand what you are saying? If jailbreaking is considered a valid way to do things. Then Apple would be unable to close exploits to the system because then they would be blocking competition.",

I don't think he's tried taking it to Proton yet.\n\nIf anyone's new to Wine from SteamOS/Deck... it's always been a hot unfinished mess. I think the gaming industry consolidating around a few game engines (and thus reducing what Wine needs to implement correctly) has helped Wine more than anything else. That's why it can run modern games but not, like, Paint.NET (4+).\n\nUsually people bring up Epic buying timed exclusives. I think that's a lot more convincing.",

Then they are not in compliance. Simple as that.

If you want to access that market…that is 100% their market. They have a monopoly on “Apple Devices”, but not on “Cell phones” whatsoever.\n\nEpic wants to use Apples infrastructure, their “Walled Garden”, then they need to pay for those costs. Apple built a specific framework that protects its users, minimizes fraud and bad applications…but that comes with more centralized control from Apple. They have to review, and approve the apps. It’s not always easy - they reject a lot, you have to make sure that you are following their user guidelines.\n\nI prefer to have that layer of safety in my mobile device. If I want to hack something, I’ll use a different device than the one that i need to rely on for…everything.\n\nDue to that, the walled garden approach works for me.

The Google Play store has so much garbage that many users are tuned off from downloading anything because of their bad experiences. It’s a big reason Apple’s store monetizes so well. Less garbage. Less shit experiences. Less malware. Less crashing. Etc.\n\nTurning Apple’s App Store experience into something more like Android will reduce revenues from casual shoppers. Multiple payment options and asking users for their CC, will reduce impulse buys.\n\nThat 20% they’re trying to save will eventually be eclipsed by loss of revenue. Users don’t want to enter their CC# multiple times. It’s why people will pay extra to buy on Amazon, because it’s all right there. Users don’t want multiple stores. That’s why Amazon and Walmart dominate online. It’s not due to lack of competition or monopolies.\n\nHardly anybody outside of Reddit even gives a shit.",

There are literally hundreds of them, and they are all literal garbage -- I strongly suspect they are pumped out by AI, because there are so many and they follow the same pattern. I went through 30+ before I found a real app, and noticed this about the bogus ones:\n\nThe thumbnails had certain similarities, like most of them show 5 stars, prominently, and had fake award logos on them.\nThey had 5 star reviews, or near it, with lots of reviews. Very obviously farmed.\nWhen you fired them up, there'd be a slick introduction sequence that told you about all the amazing features the app has, and you have to keeping hit Next to get through them, until you got to:\nA subscription screen. You had to subscribe to even look at the shitty app, and the subscriptions were fucking hilarious... like $20 a week.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say there were hundreds. The App Store is so overwhelmed with garbage that it took me nearly two hours to find an actual app made by an actual developer that did the thing I was trying to do.\n\nThere's some great stuff on the App Store, but it's also overwhelmed with shovelware, predatory garbage, and in some cases, outright malware.",

Sometimes within 2 weeks of each other.\n\nThey did the spam update, low quality update, ai generated content update. None worked. In fact, it buried a lot of legitimate sites.\n\nYou can build a site or storefront and create content that follows googles guidelines to a T and google will list you on the 40th page of results. You can have the cleanest site, perfect back end, super fast site, well thought out content target towards your demographics, and you would get buried while say someone like Home Depot or Best Buy, who aren’t even in your industry will be listed on the first page of organic results because fuck all.\n\nGoogle search is a fucking disaster and the SERP pages are jumbled mess. Getting any results (spam or otherwise) that are even remotely close to what you’re looking for is a rarity. Google is a ghost of its former self. And that odd, the people run google search have been there forever.",

And now since he has so much money and his ego has gone through the roof so he thinks he can do no wrong which results in him doing stupid shit (like corning himself into buying twitter for 4 times its cost).\n\nHe’s no genius and he had a ton of help coming from money, but you can’t deny that he has (at least in the past) demonstrated good business sense.",

They aimed to do this by creating proprietary batteries, engines, and software for use in their electric vehicles. These statements are literally in the founding documentation of the company. It's how it all started.\n\nMusk then bought the company and hired a bunch of Engineers to design/build everything that had already been planned by other people. Which they did.\n\nMusk then used his own face and natural charisma to position Tesla as the biggest player in an emerging marketplace and get huge contracts from the government while also getting massive exposure from socially conscience elites.\n\nYour last sentence is correct. Tesla does owe a debt to Musk because his cult of personality allowed the company to grow far faster and bigger than it ever would have without him. He showed genuine ability as a businessman in building the company to what it is today.\n\nThe rub is that Musk wants to pretend that the entire concept of Tesla was 100% his idea (it wasn't) and that he was an integral part of designing the technology (he wasn't) and overcoming technical hurdles (he wasn't).\n\nMusk has always been a salesmen for Tesla. Nothing more. Nothing less. But he so desperately, desperately wants to be viewed as much more than that.",

He did it. 100%. He was able to hire qualified professionals and oversee their work in fulfilling the vision of Tesla. He did that.\n\nThe exact problem is that Musk and his sycophants want to pretend he both had the vision and was involved with the hands-on execution. The story he wants to sell is that it was his idea from the start. And that he was intricately involved in the designs every step of the way. And that when problems arose he was the point-man who was conquering the issues with his unique genius. In short, he desperately wants to pretend he is Tony Stark and that everything you see was the result of him and him alone.\n\nAnd that's just not true. It's factually incorrect.

But Washington seems to have concluded that that’s a problem for another time.\n\nNational Security people are so fucking dumb for anything that doesn't involve figuring out what a country is doing through spycraft. The whole sector is filled with racist boomers who stick around forever because they're unemployable outside of the public sector and would have a stroke out of cognitive dissonance if they actually went to a modern Chinese city like Shenzhen. Remember that none of the moron junior analysts who gave George W Bush the greenlight on Iraq were punished for it and many of them are still working, and even in leadership these days.\n\nThe US had the massive advantage of being able to set the rules of the road for just about everything in tech and Chinese companies were more than happy to comply since it was the path of least resistance, but we just threw it all away. Xi's domestic chip strategy and subsidies were largely floundering at the more sophisticated nodes prior to the technology sanctions. The NatSec people actually expected Chinese tech companies with hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue every year to just willingly lay down and die with these sanctions as opposed to fighting tooth and nail for their lives. None of these Chinese firms want to be spending billions of dollars each year subsidizing SMIC in creating a parallel chip infrastructure, but they will if that's their only source of high-end chips.\n\nI normally have a lot of good things to say about the rank and file employees of the US Federal government, but I have complete contempt for most of the people working in the fields of national security and border security. Literal anchors around the US' neck, honestly.",

        "comment": "https://archive.is/Hm6S9\n\nThe US government is pressing allies including the Netherlands, Germany, South Korea and Japan to further tighten restrictions on China’s access to semiconductor technology, a controversial effort that’s drawing resistance in some countries, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Biden administration’s latest push is aimed at plugging holes in export controls it’s levied over the past two years and restraining China’s progress in developing domestic chip capabilities, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.\n\nFor example, the US is urging the Netherlands to stop ASML Holding NV from servicing and repairing sensitive chipmaking equipment that Chinese clients purchased before limits on sales of those devices were put into place this year, said the people.\n\nThe US also wants Japanese companies to limit exports to China of specialized chemicals critical for chipmaking, including photoresist, they said. Japan is home to several leaders in photoresist, including JSR Corp. and Shin-Etsu Chemical Co.\n\nTokyo and The Hague have responded coolly to Washington’s latest push, arguing that they want to assess the impact of their current curbs before considering tighter measures, some of the people said. US Commerce Department officials raised the issue in Tokyo during a meeting on export controls last month, according to one of the people.\n\nRepresentatives at ASML, the Dutch trade ministry and Japan’s Ministry for Economy, Trade and Industry declined to comment. The National Security Council declined to comment and the US Commerce Department didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Biden administration has taken aim at China’s semiconductor industry since 2022, imposing sweeping controls on the export of advanced chip-making machines and sophisticated chips like those used to develop artificial intelligence. Japan and the Netherlands, the two key countries where chip-making equipment is developed, joined the US effort last year.\n\nBut holes still remain, particularly in the ability of Japanese and Dutch engineers to continue doing some equipment repairs, and in the flow of spare parts that are used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.\n\nUS officials got a shock last August when China’s Huawei Technologies Co. unveiled a smartphone powered by a homemade chip that is more than a generation ahead of where the US had sought to halt the Asian country’s progress.\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has vowed to take the “strongest possible” action following the Huawei breakthrough, while Republican lawmakers have called for a complete block of Huawei and its chipmaking partner Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.’s access to US technology.\n\nThe latest US push includes an effort to tighten existing limits. ASML needs a license to service and repair restricted gear in China, but the Netherlands has been somewhat lax about approval, according to one of the people. The US wants the Netherlands to take a more stringent approach, the person said.\n\nThe US also wants to draw more countries into its export-control blockade. The Biden administration is trying to bring Germany and South Korea into an agreement that already includes Japan and the Netherlands, since all four countries are home to key firms in the semiconductor supply chain, according to the people.\n\nFor Germany, one of the critical players is Carl Zeiss AG, a specialized glass maker that supplies ASML with the optical components necessary for advanced chip production. The US wants Germany to get Zeiss to pull back from shipping such components to China, the people said.\n\nDutch officials also hope that Germany will join the export control group, according to the people, and the Biden administration is pushing for an agreement before the G7 summit in June. Berlin last year mulled over whether to restrict exports of chip chemicals to China, but Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is slated to visit China in April, has not yet taken a stance on the issue, according to the person. Scolz’s deputy Robert Habeck, meanwhile, is visiting the US this week and will meet Raimondo during his trip.\n\nIn addition, the US has held talks with South Korea on chip export controls, given the country’s leading role in producing chips and supplying spare parts for chip-making equipment. The two countries launched a structured dialogue in February after US officials asked their counterparts in Seoul to join the multilateral group last year, according to some of the people.",

Nothing you need to do with your computer can't be handled by any nominally user-friendly Linux Distro—I'm partial to Linux Mint personally, but you're welcome to proselytize for your own preference.\n\nEven if you are a gamer, gaming on Linux has been dramatically improving year over year as developers adopt cross-platform engines and programming languages, and with Steam Deck in particular, there's active demand for game developers to support Linux as a platform.\n\nCombined with this, Microsoft has been Enshittifying Windows as a Desktop OS.\n\nSo no real shock to me that Linux is starting to break through. I don't know that Linux will ever be a majority OS for consumers, but don't be surprised if that number continues to improve for Linux in the near future.",

However, the Apple OS’s current market share is similar to what we saw in January 2023 (15.33 percent) and February 2023 (16.26 percent).\n\nApple seemed to grow and then shrink over the last year, leaving only ChromeOS and unknown or other OSes in the share group - neither of which lost market share.",

I tried Ventura but Ventura kept kicking external drives off at random causing me to lose work when I was in the middle of an edit in Final Cut. So I skipped Ventura entirely. Sonoma? It's been...okay but up until 14.4? iPhone syncing has been completely broken.\n\nIf you try to sync an iOS device with Sonoma, MDCrashReportTool itself crashes and halts the sync, you have to drop into activity monitor and kill it. That this was broken for so. damn. long. is just nuts to me.\n\nWith each release it feels like something significant gets broken, significant bugs are introduced, and essential functionality is hosed in some way.\n\nMaybe seeing market share drop will light a fire under Apple's asses that they need to get their shit together.

Is it academically honest to use ChatGPT to grade papers? Does it shortchange students?\nThought bubble: Teachers and students alike will be using ChatGPT and its ilk going forward — so the focus should be on setting guardrails rather than tsk-tsking.",

The number of users \"propagated amidst\" is more about the number of people using the same cell towers. Even if wi-fi, it's not \"amidst\" billions, or millions, or hundreds of thousands, and generally not even thousands.\n\nThe whole article sounds like it was AI written, so it's just subpar.",

Trying to combat it is a bit of a balancing act.\n\nWhen it comes to changes in physiology, the earlier you can detect and respond to those changes generally, the better the outcome. That means that equipment is often configured by default to alert more than may be needed just in case - you don't want to be the person or manufacturer who missed something that lead to a death.\n\nThen there's the added complication of just how varied \"normal\" is for patients. A quick example is heart rate, the \"normal\" range is between 60 and 100 beats per minute, but there are some people, athletes for example, who have significantly lower resting rates in the 30-40 bpm range. If you hook them up to many monitors you'll get a bradycardia alarm that doesn't actually mean anything for that patient just because the monitor has a brady alarm range set to less than 60.\n\nThen the interface between the equipment and patient isn't perfect. A common problem is patient movement - if you wiggle the finger with an oximetry probe on it, or move too much with ECG leads attached, that can create readings that look to the machine like a serious problem with either the patient or how they're hooked up and trigger an alarm, one that will often disappear once the patient stops moving.\n\nSo the challenge facing medical equipment is trying to sort out how to filter out all these extraneous alarms that often look identical to very real and potentially serious problems that would demand immediate attention from medical staff. The best solution I've seen is educating the equipment users. Often once they know that a patient's \"normal\" condition lies outside the pre-configured range of the equipment, they can adjust the alarm ranges to better suit that patient, and reduce the number of alarms they're inundated with.",

EEG? … breathing monitor whose leads I attached to his chest. If he stopped breathing, I was to slap him because the startle reflex would save his tiny life.\n\nWell it turns out not breathing and having tiny underdeveloped lungs barely breathing while you sleep are very, very difficult to tell apart.\n\nWe had a lot of false alarms. And no, for the record, I could see him breathing on my chest, so no errant slaps, which now that he is 10 and healthy, you’re all welcome to find hilarious imagining the counterfactual. I promise you, at the intensely sleep deprived time, “unfathomably deep homicidal rage” is probably a good reason to wait should anyone you know go through a similar experience.\n\nAnd you know, considering a newborn’s life is somewhere between juuuust a little bit more and juuuuust a little bit less…",

We developed it based on the experience in our old facility. We planned to eliminate things like cascades of alarms that would come in during a major incident or failure and alarms that did not require a response from the operator. We planned to tightly control what alarms got put into the system.\n\nThen we started actually building the thing and all that got tossed in the trash. Things are a little better now, but we still have huge cascades of alarms when there's a major failure like a big power did. We still have audible alerts whose only purpose is to make the operator go over the panel and silence them. Random alarms still pop up that I've never seen before.",

I like the \"dark cockpit\" analogy that OP posted.

They put a big screen sure, but making it usable was barely a consideration, which seems wild considering how fast, responsive, intuitive and common good screens and UIs are on phones/tablets/literally everything else. Yet for a $30k car, they're still utter shit.\n\nMy Mazda on the other hand doesn't have a touch screen at all! There's a scroll/click wheel and a few shortcut buttons just in front of the armrest so I never even need to lift my arm or spend too long carefully hitting a virtual button with no tactile feel. And because I don't need to reach the screen with my hand, it's located much higher up and further back on the dash, meaning I don't hardly have to look down from the road to see it...

Then they complain that lifted trucks are the problem.\n\nNow factor in that there is no test to determine if you can actually see at night. Night blindness is a real thing.\n\nEveryone is saying it’s the loss of tactile feedback that’s the problem. Nope. It’s the fact that you’re intentionally blinding yourself with an interface you shouldn’t need to be interacting with while moving.\n\nIt’s stupidity on top of stupidity. Yes, get rid of the screens, but let’s not pretend the problem is a loss of tactile feedback.

That pump took the industry by storm when it was launched in 2001 because it was considered the first \"smart pump\" that would reduce pharmacy and nursing errors through software \"guardrails.\"\n\nSo it's not \"thoughtless design is causing actual deaths.\" The whole point of that particular pump is patient safety and it's why it continues to lead the market. Everything in that pump was put there for a reason that was the result of clinical trials or rigid application of AAMI/ISO/ANSI standards, and that includes the alarms.\n\nThe article points out that only 15% of studied alarms were of clinical significance and claims most are \"threshold\" alarms which include what are known as nuisance alarms. But what are nuisance alarms? They're there because something isn't working right, and that's a safety concern. Pumps are famous for \"occlusion alarms\" because the IV tubing is soft and easy to pinch. But pinch that tubing, and you're not getting life-saving medication. That's more than a nuisance.\n\nAre there too many of them? Yes probably but it's also directly related to the number of clinicians available to care for a patient. Today that is a challenge because the devices need more of the clinicians attention than they're able to give.\n\nWhat's the solution? The article doesn't even touch on it. Instead it talks about changing the sound of the alarms. But the research study does, the authors of the paper suggest more work to define the algorithms that define \"thresholds.\"\n\nI would agree and generally say the answer is to change the engineering of the device so it's less susceptible or it can self-correct, and change the regulations that will allow devices to make smart decisions without clinical oversight. The US Military uses such pumps with far more automated tech out of necessity on the battlefield, designed by the same company.\n\nI'm glad the article is getting attention. The whole thing needs work and revised AAMI/ISO/ANSI standards, particularly in the era of AI and sophisticated software that can take on more clinical work. I also often coach young UX designers to enter the field, and to join the expert panels who author these standards.\n\nThis topic alone could consume the entire span of your career.",

The IV pump is a bad example because that is nurses bread and butter, but nurses don’t get trained on how to use most equipment in the hospital. They get trained how to medically care for the patient, but that does not necessarily include the equipment like beds, stretchers, monitors etc… For example, a course might teach them how to read an ecg, but the actual monitor that records the ecg is not included in that training, and may be a different brand per hospital.    \n\nAs a result, many of them will only be able to work the machines as far as they spent the time to figure them out. If that means they only figured out how to silence the beeping, then that’s what they will do. It’s similar to how tech support has to deal with countless people who haven’t even tried to turn it off and back on again before calling, or done know how to “save” their document.

We were going on some side roads and asked me what the speed limit was. I honestly had no idea.\n\nA cop pulled her over and asked her what the speed limit was, we both said we had no idea and saw no signs. In fact there were no signs, we just came off Indian territory and the cops sit right at this road right after it and get people for speeding.\n\nThere was no sign, the sign hadn't come up yet. He ended up not giving the ticket, but left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nThese shit cops knew there wasn't a sign, knew it was a change in speed, knew it gets people and sit there ticketing people.\n\nThey could easily make getting speed limit information easily accessible, but they know it makes them money, so they don't do it.\n\nThey do literally all over the nation. Sit at places terribly marked and known for speed limit changes, then pull over the out of towners. Its an entire grift and the cops are the largest gang.\n\nThere are towns of 500 people that have new multi-million dollar police stations from all the money they have grifted.\n\nSpeed limits are a scam. Until the government mandates speed limit data registry in a car, they are just straight up trying to rob you and trick you.\n\nCops know about these trouble areas and instead of attempting to fix them. Sit at them and farm people for making a mistake a lot of people do.\n\nI'm sorry, if everyone makes the same mistake, it isn't a mistake. You are the mistake for bad design.\n\nThis is why I use Waze, people can write notes and warn you about things. \"Cops approaching, speed limit change\".\n\nWhy can't the government get me this vitally crucial information better? The answer, they get stuck in their ways and never change.\n\nThe fact we don't have a registry pulling speed limits tells us where their priorities lie. It isn't safety, its money and power. The safe thing is clear.\n\nWe need to employ this philosophy much more. If everyone makes a mistake, its not a mistake. Its a systemic problem.

                "comment": "It’s essentially victim blaming. Administration deciding that nurses taking on more responsibilities tends to be the catch-all solution for every problem that comes up in the hospital, to a relentless degree. It makes it next to impossible to provide adequate or safe patient care because this is often combined with unwieldy nurse:patient ratios. There’s only so much time in a day, there’s only so many places a person can be at one time, and the list of expected work tasks tends to be beyond what is humanly possible, so tasks get shoved down the list of priorities (and when working in a critical setting, often time the highest priorities are what need to be done to keep a patient compatible with life or at the very least adequately treated).\n\nMuch of the time when this unsustainable model is questioned or an adverse event occurs because of it, management blames the nursing staff on not managing stress well enough rather than observing what systemic issues contributed to that event happening.\n\nNursing speaks up about having next to no work:life balance because they’re constantly staying late on their shift to finish their documentation? Clearly nursing isn’t taking care of themselves outside the job.\n\nNursing points out they’re not picking up overtime because they’re completely exhausted from trying to keep up with sick patients and a list of tasks that’s usually too long for one person to accomplish? Clearly nursing isn’t taking care of themselves outside the job.\n\nNursing brings up that they’re not mentally well because of the stress of the job, and developing mental health issues that bleed into their job and personal life? Clearly nursing isn’t taking care of themselves outside the job.\n\nMuch of the time, what can solve all these issues is hiring more staff to relieve the workload, but nurses are necessary for providing most all care and treatments at the bedside and cannot bill for reimbursement for their services—so the nursing dept budget is always a black hole that funding goes into and a healthcare system doesn’t directly see a cent come back from. (This is a generalization of course, nursing care contributes to creating better outcomes for patients so there is more complete reimbursement that comes from insurance companies, but it isn’t a linear contribution to the overall budget.)\n\nAnd that’s not to say there isn’t a shred of truth in what’s being said—it’s important to make sure you’re taking care of yourself, and that’s up to you as a person. But most of the factors that contribute to having those problems in the first place comes from the fact that these days nurses work in a broken system that has gone from being mostly care driven to mostly profit driven. And much of the time, healthcare systems opt to gobble up, chew up, and spit out nurses so that anyone with experience enough to know when to push back and speak up against administration tends to leave the field entirely, and the wave of new graduates that come into it have no idea that the working conditions shouldn’t be that bad because it’s been established as a norm for them.",

It was an oddly reassuring feeling to have the regular compressions.\n\nOne of the worst design decisions I think I experienced was in the SDU. I guess someone thought that younger children would be upset by simple beeping sounds and opted to have the alarms play tunes from nursery rhymes. (I'm trying to remember which tune I heard, over-and-over-and-over, but I guess my brain blocked it out.)\n\nBut the hilarious (read: horrendous) thing is that these medical devices were never intended to be used as musical instruments. I have been a musician for most of my life and, while I might not have absolute perfect pitch, I can certainly tell when things are generally in tune or not.\n\nIt was near bedlam in my brain when two of these \"child-friendly\" alarms went off trying to play the same melody off-key and out of time with one another. This layered with the poor kid's wailing... If there were ever a sign that one might actually be a victim in the purgatory of The Bad Place™.",

We have a brand new baby who wakes every hour or two, and then the alarms are blaring, nurses barging in to check vitals and administer medications, etc. I was actually starting to feel delirious and like I was loosing my mind.

I was in the hospital for four nights and they wanted to keep me another night for observation due to my health issues. I had a full blown panic attack because I could literally not fathom another night of no sleep. My husband remembers that one time a nurse came in to wake me up and take my blood and I asked if she could come back later. She said she had to do this now and I was sitting there sobbing as she was drawing blood. She apologized for having to wake me I guess but I have zero memory of this because I was so delirious. We finally went home and my husband was so freaked out that I was going to die in our bed because I was so weak from exhaustion and lack of sleep. Fuck hospitals and their noisy bullshit.

I could see his BP, heart rate, pulse, and O2 level. Every time he moved his arm the alert beep would start. After the third time a nurse came into silence it, I started doing it myself. A week later he was transferred to a nursing home for rehab. There was a constant alarm beeping in the main hallway. I discovered it was tied to the patient call buttons. If any patient pushed their button, the alarm would start, a light outside their room would flash, and a panel at the nurses station would blink for the room. There were over 100 rooms. The alarm never stopped. The aides had long stopped paying attention. The patient call buttons were useless. A long-time resident told me the only way to get help was to yell at anyone you saw in the hallway.",

You know that they make a lot of loud beeps and warnings for a variety of reasons.\n\nWell these techs had to turn my son on his side to take the X-rays. When they did, the ventilator started making tons of noise, warning of changes in air pressure. One of the X-ray techs decided to mute the ventilator because it was annoying him I guess.\n\nAbout a minute or so later I am looking into the room and watching them, and I notice my son’s lips and around his face was turning blue. I started yelling and screaming saying he couldn’t breathe.\n\nDoctors rushed in and they had to re-intubate him because his other tube had become plugged with mucus.\n\nThe techs weren’t watching his oxygen levels. Because they had muted all the alarms.\n\nLuckily my son is alive and well. But I still have nightmares of that moment and his blue face 11 years later.",

The beeping was the last problematic thing there. They gave me a new hospital bed meant to prevent bed sores, the issue is it was an air mattress that constantly needed to be inflated with these little strategically placed holes right where my head was. So it was like someone was blow drying their hair at the foot of the bed while several people were all blowing different whistles at the head. Then my room was next to the nurse's station so the automatic doors would swing open and crash against the wall of my room sounding like someone was kicking my door in every 5 minutes. Lastly the room itself was kind of really loud dehumidifier room so my dry eyes and throat where deeply uncomfortable the entire time. I was starting to wonder if the entire thing was set up as some kind of CIA sleep deprivation interrogation study with how terrible it was. Only one single medical professional acknowledged how deeply uncomfortable the entire thing was when he struggled to speak with how dry the air was. My ears were ringing for a week after I got out",

This seems likely.\n\nAlso as someone pointed out, if it's so easy for the game companies to create this from an AI then why couldn't I just do the same thing and make my own games? Why would I pay anyone for AI generated content.\n\nProcedural generation is used a lot more than people realize. Similar to plastic surgery or cgi, people decry it because they notice the really bad ones, but they don't notice the really good ones, so they don't register those positives.\n\nThe company is still going to make their game engine, implement mechanics, have a cohesive artstyle with tile/texture sets, consistent models, etc. Designers have ideas of how they want certain key points in the game to look and work. Procedural generation is mostly used to fill in gaps. Also, procedural generation used correctly will be reviewed by a human to look for flaws (not just a QA junior who is making sure you can't clip through the generated terrain, but someone looking at if from an actual level design perspective). Sometimes, the core vision, or meat of the level/area is implemented within a larger procedurally generated space. I promise you that nigh every forest and cave in AAA open world games for the past 20 years has been procedurally generated, though not necessarily left as-is after that.",

Imagine instead of spending a full day building the base of a character model, you could chat with an AI, describe generally what you want, get a base, tell it what to enhance, then go to town modifying and making it better. Assuming the AI can create good mesh topology, you’ve just saved yourself a crapton of time sculpting and editing.\n\nOr building environments, imagine telling an AI, build a desert biome with lots of cacti, a large canyon, a river, and an oasis in the north west. Include a small western town, that is run down, with neon lights and peeling paint. Bam it models everything and then you spend time cleaning it up, saving yourself days meticulously sculpting the geometry of the land, finding appropriate vegetation models and applying them, and then weeks generating the appropriate texture maps.\n\nSome of this already sort of exists with things like speedtree, which has been around for a long time, but just wasn’t labeled “ai” because it’s more parametric than learned.\n\nWe bitch about costs for games and a large part of that is really the labor costs. Game development takes so much longer these days, and honestly prices don’t reflect it at all (thankfully!).

An admirable goal, but every country is just going to tariff China's EVs to the point they're competitive with their own local manufacturers. As is their right to do, to protect their own economies and workers.\n\nThis effectively defeats the purpose of their subsidies and understandably would be upsetting.

China was historically a net steel importer but for years they subsidized their steel industry specifically to sell on the global market ~25% cheaper than the rest of the world so they could be a net exporter. In only 7 years, China subsidized $27 billion, but those 7 years severely hurt steel industries in various other countries and even put some out of business.\n\nTry and think about that a little. China can pour money into an industry for an extended period of time to damage other competitors, then once they've gained market control, they can raise prices and assert influence. At a macroeconomic scale a tariff is a direct response to subsidies.",

Eu should also make Chinese companies transfer any relevant tech including batteries to their eu partner. Why? Because China did this for decades to European car manufacturers",
