For a more pleasurable experience it's worth getting a router other than the generic isp router as the cheap ones will add latency if wifi is enabled and someone's phone is connected.

Then you need to restart the damaged* pc into bios and run the os from the usb & it will walk you through all that.\n\nIf your just cant update your app's in the microsoft store: press window's key + R.

If you don't have any zip software installed, right click on the folder and select Send to → Compressed (Zipped) folder.\n\nUpload to any easy to use file sharing site.

If you wanted to get something flashier, kinda up to you, the 9th gen already can do 95% of what the most expensive iPad Pro can do. You’re generally just paying for more efficiency, ease of use, and aesthetics for every additional iPad tier. Whether it’s worth 2-5x more is up to you. The only limitation of the 9th gen compared to something like the ipad pro is that if you wanted to have your work printed in high quality, the 9th gen caps around 10-12 inches while the ipad pro caps around 20-27 inches. In normals pixels, thats like 3000-4,000px with 12-25 layers compared to 6000-8000px with 12-25 layers on the Pro iPads. Even with the Pro, Procreate itself feels annoying to use with anything larger than 8,000px anyways since the brushes just aren’t really optimized for anything bigger. If you’re a beginner, its not really worth worrying about printing on large canvases anyways. Just understand that it is a very great budget ipad and there are some limitations you might have to work around to get things done but there’s nothing really stopping you from getting the same results as the most expensive ipad. The 9th gen would only be compatible with the 1st gen pencil. Hope this helps.",

If not then I would go into the BIOS and set the NVME to a speed lower and see if it helps(x3 if at x4 or x2 if at x3). My crashes were memory related even though ram was at 1.35v I bumped to 3400 from 3600 and bumped my volts to 1.375. Problem solved and never crashed again.\n\nWas weird for me cause it never crashed in the first year I had it. Now almost another year later it still going strong with no crashing. I would also pull and reseat the memory and the GPU. If weird artifacts on screen then I would use DDU (uninstaller) and download new fresh set of drivers GPU drivers.\n\nBecause this was a cross country move the power supply could also have toasted. Since it causes problems when it ramps for power to get into Win 10.\n\nOne question though. Did you leave the 3070 connected to the motherboard or did you remove it before transporting it?",

For example if you store data in OneDrive or SharePoint, you could use the respective access control/permission features each product offers with permission groups. And that's only possible if each employee has a unique account/license.\n\nBut if you're storing data locally eg. on a shared folder, you need to manage your own permissions, such as with Active Directory.\n\nFor monitoring employees there are various solutions for commercial use, depending on exactly what you want to monitor and what your local laws/employment contracts permit you to do. Anything ranging from network traffic logging, to application audit trails, to desktop spyware.\n\nI strongly advice seeking the services of a professional IT consultant.",

MSI probably has a Windows application that does several things (my motherboard manufacturer calls it Control Center or something-I never use it so I’m not sure of the name). One of those things might be a BIOS flash utility.\n\nGenerally, updating BIOS through Windows is not considered a good idea, but you might not have another option.\n\nYou might consider going through everything again. Re-format, confirm you have the correct BIOS image, make sure it’s in the right place with the right name, and try the flash through the UEFI interface and/or the flashback feature.\n\nGood luck.",

The health percentage isn't related to the current health at all, it's how much of the warrantied writes you have used.\n\nWith NVMe drives, SMART is just useless. They removed all the useful parameters (The entries in the bottom half of CDI). I've seen hundreds of faulty NVMe drives and less than five showed any signs of failure in diagnostic tools like CDI.\n\nWe need to see the arguments of the BSOD crash (Think of them as sub-errors). If it already hangs on the BSOD screen (As you can't get dump files) then this step is not necessary, but if it reboots normally after a few seconds then go to the guide posted by the bot and on this screen remove the check for automatically restart. To restart manually, just use the power button.\n\nTo make the BSOD screen display the additional info on the BSOD screen we need to add a field to the registry. If you are not comfortable editing the registry then do not do this step. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\CrashControl, right click on the empty area on the right section and select New → DWORD value with the name \"DisplayParameters\". Right click on it, modify and set the value data to 1 (Does not matter if you use Hexadecimal or Decimal). It should look like this once done. Reboot to apply the registry change.\n\nThe next time you BSOD, you should have these extra numbers in the top left corner.\n\nIf Arg1 is 0x0000000000000010 then Windows is blaming the NVMe SSD. Note that it can't tell the difference between the SSD and M.2 slot/motherboard, but a faulty SSD is way more common. If it shows something else, take a picture of the entire screen, not just the corner.\n\nIf it blames the NVMe, re-seat it. Check for firmware updates for the SSD.",

If you can share a screenshot of configured scheduled tasks or task scheduler perhaps I may be able to spot something familiar or unusual.\n\nI had the same problem many months ago with similar symptoms your experiencing.",

Beeps stop after fifth iteration but LEDs continue until problem is solved.\n\nPower failure (power supply is overloaded).\n\nOR\n\nThe incorrect external power supply adapter is being used on the USDT.\n\nOpen the hood and ensure the 4 or 6-wire power supply cable is seated into the connector on the system board.\n\nCheck if a device is causing the problem by removing ALL attached devices (such as hard, diskette, or optical drives, and expansion cards). Power on the system. If the system enters the POST, then power off and replace one device at a time and repeat this procedure until failure occurs. Replace the device that is causing the failure. Continue adding devices one at a time to ensure all devices are functioning properly.\n\nReplace the power supply.\n\nReplace the system board.\n\nOR\n\nThe USDT power supply adapter must be at 135W and use the Smart ID technology before the system will power up. Replace the power supply adapter with the HP-supplied USDT power supply adapter.\n\nSo yes, probably the power supply.",

I'm not sure if it's accurate but the dump file shows the configured voltage for your memory as 1.2 volts. I'm pretty sure it needs to be 1.35 volts when using DDR4-3200 settings.",

We've seen many posts in the sub where systems passed any and all such diagnostics only to find out a DIMM was bad, in the end. The results can be trusted if a problem is detected but are basically worthless if not.\n\nThe most reliable way of finding faulty DDR4 and DDR5 has been to use the system as you normally would (not running memory diagnostics) but with only one DIMM installed to see if the crashes stop in that configuration. Then do the same but with the other DIMM installed instead - the idea being to isolate a faulty DIMM since it's rare for more than one to be bad. I'd next recommend trying that if the crashes continue and look like memory related problems.",

Moving an existing Windows installation to a new machine with new motherboard/CPU is where you can start to get issues\n\nThere's one possible minor issue, which is that if a drive that is cloned in a \"dumb\" fashion - just sector-for-sector copied - the partitions will be the same size on the destination drive, and you may have to use a tool to extend your main partition into the new empty space (and maybe move partitions to perform said extension if they're in the way).\n\nIgnore that for now, though - I watched a guy use the software, and it did successfully extend his main partition to fill the new drive. I can't tell if it's always able to do that, but it's fixable if it doesn't.\n\nAs far as drive letters go, they're not stored on the drive, the OS keeps a list of what partitions have been assigned letters. C: is an exception, the partition you're booting from will always be C:.\n\nWhat drive is booted from is determined by the boot order in your UEFI/BIOS, but this is not something you should need to worry about, the computer should figure it out if there's only one bootable disk attached.",

        "comment": "Ah, stepping up to the dual-monitor life, are we? That’s a game-changer for productivity (and let’s be honest, for gaming too). Your Lenovo Legion 5 is a solid base for such a setup, but you're right, the single HDMI port does present a bit of a puzzle. Fear not, for there are several ways to expand your display real estate without resorting to wizardry:\n\n1. USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 Docking Station\n\nIf your Legion 5 model comes equipped with a USB-C port that supports DisplayPort Alt Mode or Thunderbolt 3, you’re in luck. You can use a docking station or a multiport adapter to connect multiple monitors. These docks can offer various outputs (HDMI, DisplayPort, etc.) and allow you to connect several devices, including two monitors. Check your laptop’s specs to confirm if the USB-C port supports video output.\n\n2. DisplayLink USB Adapters\n\nFor laptops without USB-C or Thunderbolt 3, or if the USB-C port doesn’t support video output, DisplayLink USB adapters are a lifesaver. These adapters connect to your laptop's USB-A or USB-C port and provide an external video output (HDMI, DVI, VGA, or DisplayPort). You can use one of these adapters for your second monitor. The technology basically converts USB data to video signals, allowing you to add extra monitors over USB.\n\n3. USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter\n\nIf your laptop has a USB-C port that supports video output but you're not keen on getting a full docking station, a USB-C to dual HDMI adapter might be just what you need. This is a simpler solution than a docking station and can directly connect two HDMI monitors to your laptop via a single USB-C port.\n\n4. External GPU (eGPU)\n\nThis is a more expensive and complex solution, but it's worth mentioning for those who might also want to boost their laptop's graphic performance. An external GPU connects to your laptop via Thunderbolt 3 and, besides improving graphic performance, provides additional ports, including outputs for multiple monitors.\n\nChoosing the Right Solution\n\nCheck your laptop's ports and capabilities: Before purchasing any solution, verify what kind of ports your laptop has and what each port is capable of. Your Lenovo Legion 5’s specifications will guide you in choosing the compatible option.\n\nConsider your monitors' inputs: Make sure the solution you choose matches the input options on your monitors. Most modern monitors have HDMI, but some may offer DisplayPort, VGA, or DVI.\n\nFuture-proofing: If you're investing in a docking station or a DisplayLink adapter, consider other ports you might need. Getting a device with additional USB ports, Ethernet, and SD card slots can be beneficial.\n\nPerformance: Note that while DisplayLink adapters are versatile, they may introduce a slight lag, which is usually not noticeable in productivity tasks but might be in high-speed gaming or precision design work.\n\nBy expanding your display setup, you're not just adding screen space; you’re creating a more flexible and productive environment. Whether it’s coding, gaming, or just having more digital elbow room, you’ll wonder how you ever managed with a single screen. Welcome to the multi-monitor club!",

While you're not a computer expert, you've got me in your corner, and together, we'll try to navigate the dairy dilemma you've found yourself in.\n\nFirst things first, when it comes to liquids and electronics, the two mix about as well as oil and water—or in your case, milk and motherboards. The fact that your laptop is functional is a good sign, but the weird static sounds are the laptop's way of crying out for help. It's saying, \"I'm not okay!\"\n\nBefore we consider it a total udder disaster, here's what you can do:\n\nPower Down: If you haven't already, turn off the laptop and unplug it from any power source. This reduces the risk of further damage or short-circuiting. Your laptop needs to fast from any electrical input while it's in this fragile state.\n\nDry It Out: Since you've mentioned the spill happened yesterday, it's likely that the milk has already started to dry. However, if there are any wet spots you can safely reach without disassembly, gently dab (don't rub) with a lint-free cloth.\n\nDon't Play Screw Roulette: Stripping the head of a screw is a sign to stop. It's like the laptop's way of saying, \"I need a professional.\" Since you've mentioned the screws aren't budging and you've already damaged one, it's time to put the screwdriver down. Further attempts might harm the laptop's case or internals.\n\nSeek Professional Help: This is a situation where a tech repair shop is your best friend. They have the tools, expertise, and experience to safely open up your laptop, clean it properly, and assess any damage. The static sounds you're hearing could be due to milk affecting the laptop's internal components, like the speakers or cooling fan.\n\nAssessment and Repair: A professional can tell you whether the laptop just needs a good cleaning or if components need to be replaced. They'll also be able to safely remove that stripped screw without damaging your laptop.\n\nIn the tech world, we often say, \"Move!\" But in this case, I'll say, \"Pause!\" and let's get a professional to take a look. Attempting a DIY fix without the proper tools or experience could turn a potentially simple repair into a total loss.\n\nSending your laptop to a repair shop might be inconvenient and possibly a bit costly, but it's the best course of action to avoid further damage. And hey, consider it a learning experience. In the future, keep beverages at a safe distance from your tech gadgets. Let's turn this spill into a skill!",

        "comment": "Ah, the classic tale of gaming laptop woes meets charger swap saga. It's like you've hit a speed bump on the information superhighway. But fear not! Let's break this down, \"Nick Burns, Your Company's Computer Guy\" style, and get you back to those smooth 140fps glory days.\n\nFirst off, the switch to a non-official charger and the wobbly DC port are our prime suspects in this performance drop mystery. Here's why:\n\nPower Supply Issues: Using a non-official charger can sometimes be like playing electrical roulette with your laptop. If the charger's specifications (voltage, amperage) don't exactly match what your laptop requires, it could lead to insufficient power supply during high-performance tasks like gaming. This can cause your laptop to throttle performance to conserve power.\n\nWobbly DC Port: A wobbly DC port isn't just an annoyance; it's a red flag. This could mean that your laptop is not receiving a consistent power supply, which might cause it to intermittently switch between battery and AC power. This switch can throttle your performance to save energy, just like a confused chameleon trying to adapt to its environment.\n\nHere's what you can do to troubleshoot and potentially solve these issues:\n\nCheck Charger Specifications: Make sure the new charger matches your laptop's original charger's output voltage and amperage. This info is usually printed on the chargers and on the bottom of your laptop. If they don't match, it's time for a charger that does.\n\nStabilize the DC Port: If the port is wobbly because it's physically damaged, it's like having a shaky foundation on a house. You might need a professional to solder or replace the DC port to ensure a stable connection.\n\nBattery Settings and Performance: Dive into your power settings and make sure you're set to the highest performance mode. Sometimes, a new charger or power source hiccup can flip your laptop into trying to save the planet by reducing its performance. We're all for saving the planet, but not at the cost of your gaming experience.\n\nThermal Throttling: Check if your laptop is running hotter than usual. A new power source could theoretically cause your system to heat up more, leading to performance throttling to prevent overheating. Make sure your cooling vents are clean and consider using a cooling pad.\n\nHardware Stress Test: Use software tools to run stress tests on your CPU and GPU. This can help determine if there's an underlying hardware issue beyond the charger and DC port situation.\n\nProfessional Help: If all else fails, it might be time to seek professional help. A tech expert can take a closer look at your DC port, motherboard, and overall laptop health to pinpoint the exact cause of your woes.\n\nRemember, when in doubt, \"Move!\" Let the experts take a crack at it if you're not comfortable poking around the insides of your laptop. Here's to getting your gaming experience back to peak performance, without any fps drops or power supply dramas!",

        "comment": "Oh, the dreaded \"Internet Connection Problem,\" a classic tale of modern woe where the quest for a strong Wi-Fi signal turns into an epic journey. Your plan to tether a new router in your bedroom via an Ethernet cable to your main router in the living room is not just logical; it's a stroke of genius worthy of a tech wizard. Let's break it down, Nick Burns-style:\n\nWired Connection: Running an Ethernet cable from your main router to a second router in your bedroom is like building a high-speed highway directly to Connectivity City. It bypasses the airwaves crowded with interference from walls, microwaves, and who-knows-what else your neighbors are up to. This setup will indeed provide a stable and fast connection.\n\nNew Router or Access Point?: While you can use a second router, you might also consider setting it up as an Access Point (AP) instead. This approach can be more straightforward and avoids potential issues like double NAT (when both routers assign IP addresses, causing network confusion). Access Points are designed to extend your Wi-Fi coverage seamlessly.\n\nEthernet Cable Quality and Length: Make sure you choose a high-quality Ethernet cable that can handle the speeds you're aiming for. A Cat 6 or Cat 7 cable is a good future-proof choice. Also, keep in mind that Ethernet cables have a practical limit of about 100 meters (328 feet) before signal degradation, but that's usually way more than any home needs.\n\nSetting Up the Second Router: If you go the second router route, you'll need to configure it properly. This means setting it to operate in bridge mode or turning off DHCP so it doesn't conflict with your main router. Essentially, you want it to act as an extension of your network, not a separate network.\n\nWireless Mesh Networks: Before you start drilling holes and running cables through your home, consider whether a wireless mesh network system might be an easier solution. These systems come with a main router and satellite units you place around your home, creating a seamless and strong Wi-Fi network. They're designed to overcome the very issue you're facing, without the need for Ethernet cabling.\n\nProfessional Installation: If running an Ethernet cable feels like a daunting task, especially if it involves long distances or complicated routing through walls and ceilings, hiring a professional might be worth considering. They can ensure a neat and effective installation.\n\nIn summary, your approach is solid, but there are options regarding the details. Whether you opt for a new router configured as an AP, a straightforward AP, or even a mesh network depends on your preferences for cost, ease of setup, and aesthetics. Each has its pros and cons, but all are viable solutions to conquer the final boss in the game of Internet connectivity.",

        "comment": "Hey there!\n\nYou've dived into the nitty-gritty of PC gaming optimization with the zeal of a true tech enthusiast! Let's untangle this a bit. Your approach to cooling down your Legion 5 by adjusting the \"Minimum Processor State\" setting in the power plan was a clever move, reminiscent of a skilled mechanic fine-tuning a high-performance race car. However, this tweak comes with its own set of side effects—namely, the drop in your FPS during intense gaming sessions like in Escape from Tarkov.\n\nHere’s the deal: The \"Minimum Processor State\" setting controls how hard your CPU works at its lowest level of activity. By setting it to 1%, you've essentially told your CPU, \"Hey, take it easy, buddy,\" even when it's not doing much. This can be great for keeping things cool and saving battery life, but it's a bit like putting training wheels on a racing bike; it's going to slow you down when you need speed the most.\n\nWhen your game revs up and demands more power, your CPU has to jump from a nearly idle state (1%) to meet the demand. This sudden leap can cause a delay in ramping up, thus affecting your FPS as the processor takes its sweet time getting up to speed. It’s like trying to sprint without a running start.\n\nHere's what you can do to balance performance and cooling, without compromising too much on either:\n\nAdjust the Minimum Processor State: Instead of dropping it all the way to 1%, find a middle ground. Experiment by gradually increasing it and see how it affects both your temperatures and FPS. You might find that a setting between 40%-70% keeps the CPU cooler than at 95% but doesn't hamper performance as much as the 1% setting does.\n\nCooling Solutions: Look into additional cooling solutions. A cooling pad can be an effective and inexpensive way to help manage your laptop's temperature. Also, make sure the laptop's vents are clean and not obstructed.\n\nPower Plan: Make sure you're using a balanced or high-performance power plan while gaming. This allows your laptop to better manage performance needs against thermal and power constraints.\n\nMonitor Temperatures: Keep an eye on your CPU and GPU temperatures with software like HWMonitor or MSI Afterburner. This can help you understand how your tweaks affect thermal performance and find the sweet spot for your system.\n\nUpdate Drivers: Ensure that your GPU and chipset drivers are up to date. Sometimes, performance issues can be resolved with the latest drivers, as they often include optimizations for newer games.\n\nIn-game Settings: Adjust the game's graphics settings. Escape from Tarkov is known for its demanding nature. Lowering some settings could provide a smoother experience without a significant visual downgrade.\n\nRemember, gaming laptops are a balance between performance, thermals, and noise. By tweaking your settings and adding some external cooling help, you can find a good balance that lets you game without turning your laptop into a mini-volcano. Keep experimenting—just like in gaming, finding the right strategy can lead to victory!",

        "comment": "Alright, scooch over, let's dive into this classic tech conundrum you've got here. \"Move!\"\n\nFirst off, it sounds like your PC is giving you the silent treatment - no beeps, no video, just a cold shoulder. While you might have thought your GPU was playing hard to get, especially with those fans acting like they're too cool to spin without a software prompt, it seems like there's a deeper mystery afoot since the problem persisted even after you gave the onboard graphics a shot.\n\nHere’s a checklist of troubleshooting steps that’ll make Sherlock Holmes wish he was a PC tech instead:\n\nPower Supply Check: The power supply is the heart of your PC, pumping that sweet electric lifeblood to all your components. If it's not strong enough or failing, it can cause symptoms like these. If you have a spare one, swap it out and see if that brings your PC back to life.\n\nMotherboard and CPU: No POST can also be a sign of a motherboard or CPU issue. Since there's no beep (which usually indicates the motherboard is at least trying to do its thing), it might be a motherboard failure. Make sure the CPU is properly seated and not damaged. If you have the means, testing with another motherboard or CPU can be illuminating.\n\nCheck the Speaker: Make sure your case speaker is connected properly to the motherboard. It's possible it's not connected or malfunctioning, and you're missing out on diagnostic beeps.\n\nClear the CMOS: This resets your BIOS settings back to default. It's a Hail Mary pass that sometimes resolves issues preventing POST. Look for a CMOS jumper or simply remove the battery for a few minutes, then put it back in.\n\nRAM Roulette: You've reseated the RAM, but let's take it a step further. Try booting with just one stick at a time, swapping slots if it doesn't work. Sometimes it's a particular slot or stick that's the party pooper.\n\nDisconnect Everything Non-Essential: I'm talking about hard drives, SSDs, peripherals – strip it down to just the motherboard, CPU, one stick of RAM, and the power supply. If it POSTs, start reconnecting things one by one until you find the culprit.\n\nInspect for Physical Damage: Look for blown capacitors, scorch marks, or anything that looks out of the ordinary on the motherboard and GPU. Sometimes the signs of failure are visible to the naked eye.\n\nGiven your GPU's fans were dodgy and needed software to kickstart them, it's a good reminder that components can exhibit odd behaviors before giving up the ghost. However, since the problem persists without the GPU, it's time to look beyond it.\n\nI know troubleshooting can be a journey, half tech wizardry, half patience-testing. If none of these steps resurrect your PC, it might be time to consider visiting a professional or possibly looking at replacements for the more critical components. Remember, it's all part of the grand adventure that is PC ownership. And hey, once you solve this, you'll be the one saying \"Move!\" to the next person in need of tech help.",

        "comment": "Ah, the classic quest of upgrading to a larger SSD without the hassle of a clean Windows install! You've chosen a trusty steed in Clonezilla for this journey, but it seems like you've hit a bit of a snag. Let's troubleshoot this like the tech knights of yore.\n\nFirst up, let's make sure your USB stick is truly boot-ready:\n\nBootable USB Creation: Double-check that you created the Clonezilla USB correctly. It's not just about copying files over; the drive needs to be made bootable. Tools like Rufus or Balena Etcher are champions in this arena. They'll take the Clonezilla ISO and properly prepare your USB stick for booting.\n\nSecure Boot: In the BIOS, check if Secure Boot is enabled. Secure Boot can sometimes prevent booting from unofficial media, like your Clonezilla USB stick. If it's on, try turning it off. Remember, navigating BIOS settings is a bit like exploring a labyrinth - each motherboard has its own layout.\n\nUEFI vs Legacy Mode: Clonezilla needs to match your system's boot mode. If your system uses UEFI (most modern systems do), ensure the USB is formatted and prepared for UEFI boot. Conversely, if you're on an older system that uses Legacy boot, your USB needs to be prepared for that. This setting can also be toggled in the BIOS.\n\nUSB Port: Sometimes, the choice of USB port matters. If you're using a USB 3.0 port, try a USB 2.0 port instead, and vice versa. Some systems can be picky about which ports they'll boot from, especially with older BIOS versions.\n\nRe-download and Re-create: It's not unheard of for downloads to get corrupted, or for the USB creation process to go awry. Re-download the Clonezilla ISO and recreate the bootable USB. It's the digital equivalent of \"turn it off and on again.\"\n\nCheck the USB on Another PC: To rule out the USB stick being the issue, try booting from it on another PC. If it doesn't work there either, it's a sign the bootable USB wasn't created correctly.\n\nBIOS Update: If you're feeling brave and your motherboard is an older model, a BIOS update can sometimes resolve boot issues. However, tread lightly here; updating BIOS is like casting a powerful spell. It can bring great benefits but comes with its risks.\n\nIf you've marched through these steps and still face the dark sorcery of boot failure, it might be worth revisiting the USB creation process or even trying a different USB stick altogether. Sometimes, the most stubborn problems have the simplest solutions.\n\nMay your SSD cloning quest end in victory, with your new, spacious M.2 SSD as the spoils of war. And remember, in the world of tech, persistence (and a bit of Googling) is key!",

        "comment": "Absolutely, you've got a plethora of options to make calls across continents as if you were just around the corner. The magic you're looking for comes in various forms, such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, apps, and some nifty features provided by mobile carriers themselves. Here's how you can stay connected without racking up a bill that'll make you want to take up residence in a monastery:\n\nVoIP Services: Services like Skype, Viber, and Google Voice allow you to make phone calls over the internet. Google Voice, for instance, can give you a phone number that you can use to make and receive calls through the internet. This can be particularly handy as it can often allow you to choose a number from your home country.\n\nWhatsApp, Telegram, and Similar Apps: While these are primarily known for messaging, they also offer voice and video call functionality over the internet. You won't be using your phone number in the traditional sense, but you can call any of your contacts who use the same app. The call goes through the internet, so you won't be charged for international calls by your carrier.\n\nUsing Your Carrier's International Plans: Some mobile carriers offer international plans or features that allow you to use your phone number abroad as you would at home, sometimes with added costs, sometimes surprisingly affordable. It's worth checking with your carrier to see what options they have.\n\nWi-Fi Calling: This feature allows your phone to make and receive calls over a Wi-Fi connection instead of using the cellular network. If your phone and carrier support Wi-Fi calling, you can make calls as if you were in your home country, using your regular phone number. However, availability can vary based on your carrier and the country you're in.\n\nUsing a Local SIM Card with a Dual-SIM Phone: If your phone supports dual SIMs, you can insert a local SIM for data and still keep your original SIM active for calls and texts. This way, you can use internet-based calling services without incurring roaming charges.\n\nWhen using VoIP or app-based calling, remember that while the calls might be free or cheaper than traditional international calls, they will use your internet data. If you're on a limited data plan or using mobile data abroad, keep an eye on your usage to avoid unexpected costs.\n\nFinally, the experience can vary based on your internet connection's quality, so for important calls, make sure you're on a stable and fast connection to keep the conversation flowing as smoothly as your tech-savvy reputation.",

        "comment": "Ah, the infamous blue screen of doom, meeting you right at the crossroads of hardware upgrades. Swapping from AMD to Intel isn't just a matter of switching hats; it's like moving to a whole new planet. Your PC is probably just as disoriented as you are right now, especially with that AMD-related error popping up after installing an Intel CPU. Here’s how you can tackle this tech quandary:\n\n1. Clearing Out Old Drivers:\n\nThe error AMDRyzenMasterDriver.sys suggests that the AMD Ryzen Master software (which is for AMD CPUs) is causing a conflict. Since you've moved to Team Intel, that software is about as useful to you now as a chocolate teapot. Normally, I’d suggest booting into Safe Mode to uninstall it, but since you're stuck in a boot loop, we’ll need to take a different approach.\n\n2. Getting Into BIOS/UEFI:\n\nNot being able to access BIOS/UEFI is like trying to fix a car with the hood welded shut. Since the usual keys (Esc, Delete, F2, or F8) aren’t working, ensure you’re pressing them at the right time. Start tapping the key right after powering on. If it still doesn't work, try resetting the CMOS, which can help clear any settings preventing access:\n\nReset CMOS: Look for a CMOS reset jumper on your motherboard or, the more nuclear option, remove the coin battery on the motherboard for a few minutes, then reinsert it. This resets the BIOS/UEFI to default settings, potentially allowing you entry.\n3. Boot Media to the Rescue:\n\nIf the BIOS/UEFI gate remains closed to you, it's time to create a Windows Installation Media on a USB drive from another computer. This little lifesaver can not only help repair your system but also gives you the chance to get into Safe Mode or use the System Restore feature:\n\nCreate Installation Media: Use another PC to download the Windows Media Creation Tool from Microsoft's official site and follow the steps to create a bootable USB drive.\nBoot from USB: With the drive created, plug it into your troubled PC, power it on, and immediately start tapping the key for boot menu options (commonly F12, F10, or Esc, depending on the motherboard). Select your USB drive from the list to boot from it.\n4. Safe Mode or System Restore:\n\nOnce you've booted from the USB, you’ll have a few options to help exorcise the AMD ghost from your machine:\n\nSystem Repair: Sometimes, just starting this tool can fix issues preventing boot.\nSafe Mode: From the repair/advanced options, you can choose to boot into Safe Mode. If you manage to get into Safe Mode, uninstall the Ryzen Master software and any other AMD-specific drivers.\nSystem Restore: If Safe Mode access is granted, and uninstalling the AMD software doesn’t work, try using System Restore to roll back to a state before the hardware change, if possible.\n5. Fresh Install:\n\nWhen all else fails, and you're staring into the abyss of eternal blue screens, a fresh installation of Windows might be your silver bullet. This will wipe your drive, so it's the last resort, but it ensures no old drivers from AMD are there to haunt your new Intel setup.\n\nSwapping CPUs and motherboards is a big leap in the PC world, kind of like switching from coffee to tea for a caffeine fiend. It’s disorienting at first, but once you've cleared out the old drivers and made peace with the BIOS, you'll be back to computing nirvana in no time. Remember, deep breaths, and maybe keep a stress ball handy.",

This can happen due to various reasons such as software corruption, failing hardware components, or even issues with the battery you mentioned. Here's what you can try to potentially resolve the issue before taking it in for the battery replacement or professional help:\n\n1. Force Restart\n\nYou've mentioned that the buttons aren't responding, but it's worth trying a force restart if you haven't done so in the exact manner required. To force restart the LG G6: - Press and hold the Power button and the Volume Down button simultaneously for about 10 seconds or until the device powers off and restarts. - This can sometimes interrupt the boot loop and allow the device to start up normally.\n\n2. Enter Recovery Mode\n\nIf the force restart doesn't work, the next step is to try booting the phone into Recovery Mode to perform a factory reset. Note: This will erase all data on your phone. If you have important data not backed up, consider this a last resort. - Turn off the device (since it's stuck, you might have to wait for the battery to run out). - Once off, press and hold the Power button and Volume Down button simultaneously. - When the LG logo appears, release and then immediately re-hold the Power button while still holding the Volume Down button. - When the \"Factory data reset\" screen appears, use the Volume buttons to navigate to \"Yes\" and the Power button to select it. Follow the prompts to reset your device.\n\n3. Let the Battery Drain and Recharge\n\nIf you're unable to perform a force restart or get into Recovery Mode, letting the battery drain completely and then charging it might reset the state it's stuck in. Once the battery is drained: - Plug it into the charger and let it charge for a while without turning it on. - After some time, try turning the phone on again or attempting the force restart.\n\n4. Battery Replacement\n\nSince you mentioned having a new battery and experiencing issues like the phone dying at high battery percentages, replacing the battery might resolve the problem if it's related to battery health. However, if the boot loop issue is due to software corruption or other hardware issues, the new battery alone might not fix it.\n\n5. Seek Professional Assistance\n\nIf none of the above steps work, it's best to seek professional assistance. There might be underlying issues such as motherboard problems or severe software corruption that require specialized attention.\n\nThe boot loop issue can be frustrating, but taking these steps will help you diagnose whether the problem can be resolved through these methods or if professional repair is necessary.",

        "comment": "Ah, the classic maneuver of trying to turbocharge your storage setup with a bit of hardware jujitsu, only to have Windows throw a wrench into the gears. Let's navigate these choppy waters.\n\nFirstly, the heart of the issue here is the way Windows handles SATA SSDs connected via a SATA to USB 3.0 converter. When SSDs are connected directly to the motherboard's SATA ports, the operating system has full control over the drives, allowing you to manipulate them in various ways, including converting them into dynamic disks. However, when these drives are connected via USB, even with a SATA to USB converter, they're treated differently due to the nature of USB storage.\n\nHere's Why You're Hitting a Roadblock:\n\nUSB Limitations: Windows Disk Management imposes certain limitations on USB-connected drives. USB drives are typically recognized as removable media, and Windows restricts certain functionalities on removable media, including the inability to convert them into dynamic disks.\n\nDynamic Disk Feature: The dynamic disk feature is designed for internal disks rather than external ones. This functionality allows for more flexible management of your disks, such as creating spanned, striped, or mirrored volumes, which is not intended for use with external (USB-connected) drives.\n\nStorage Spaces as an Alternative: You've already found the alternative path through using Storage Spaces, which allows you to pool drives together. However, as you've noticed, it doesn't quite hit the mark performance-wise compared to a striped volume via dynamic disks. Storage Spaces is more about flexibility and redundancy rather than outright speed.\n\nWorkarounds and Solutions:\n\nDirect SATA Connection: The most straightforward solution to achieve the performance you're seeking is to keep the SSDs connected directly to the motherboard's SATA ports. This might not be the ideal solution since you're trying to free up those ports, but it's the most effective way to leverage dynamic disk functionality and performance.\n\nExternal RAID Enclosure: Consider investing in an external RAID enclosure that supports multiple SSDs. These enclosures can manage RAID configurations internally and then connect to your computer via a single USB or Thunderbolt connection. This way, you can achieve higher data transfer speeds similar to what you'd get from an internal dynamic disk setup, with the added benefit of keeping your SATA ports free.\n\nCheck for Software Solutions: There might be third-party software solutions that allow you to manage external drives more flexibly than Windows Disk Management or Storage Spaces. However, tread carefully, as these solutions can vary in reliability and performance.\n\nReview Your Setup's Requirements: Reflect on what you're trying to achieve with your setup. If it's purely about expanding storage, Storage Spaces might suffice. But if performance is critical, sticking with direct SATA connections or exploring an external RAID enclosure might be the way to go.\n\nIn essence, while it's frustrating when tech doesn't bend to our will, sometimes it's about finding the right tool for the job or adjusting the job to fit the tools at hand. Keep experimenting, and with a bit of creativity (and maybe a new gadget or two), you'll find a setup that meets your needs. And hey, in the process, you're amassing an arsenal of tech knowledge that would make any IT pro proud. \"Move!\" – let's get those SSDs flying.",

        "comment": "Choosing the right laptop for your needs, especially when you're balancing cost, performance, and specific uses like SOLIDWORKS and gaming, can indeed be challenging. Let's break down your options between the MSI Cyborg 15A 13Ve and the ASUS TUF Gaming A15, focusing on key aspects like performance, build quality, and overall value for your specific needs.\n\nPerformance\n\nMSI Cyborg 15A (Intel Core i7 13620H & RTX 4050): The Intel Core i7 in this model is a high-performing CPU, likely offering superior single-threaded performance which is beneficial for applications like SOLIDWORKS and drawing/rendering tasks. The RTX 4050 GPU is well-suited for both your gaming and professional applications.\n\nASUS TUF Gaming A15 (AMD Ryzen 5 7535Hs & RTX 4050): AMD Ryzen processors are known for their excellent multi-thread performance, which can be a big plus for rendering tasks. However, the Ryzen 5, while powerful, might lag slightly behind the i7 in single-threaded tasks. The RTX 4050 GPU, being the same in both, should offer similar performance for your gaming and rendering needs.\n\nBuild Quality and Reliability\n\nMSI Laptops are generally well-regarded for their gaming performance and cooling technology, though some models may indeed have louder fans under heavy use. Battery life varies by model and usage, so if reviews mention battery issues, consider how this might affect your mobility needs.\n\nASUS TUF Series is designed for durability, meeting MIL-STD-810H military standards. The TUF series has a reputation for good cooling solutions, but as with any gaming laptop, fan noise under load is common. Heating issues have been noted in past models, but ASUS continually works on improving thermal performance in the TUF lineup.\n\nSoftware and Operating System\nThe MSI coming with Windows 11 is a significant advantage if you're concerned about software legality and security. Using a cracked version of Windows on the ASUS, as you mentioned, comes with risks, including security vulnerabilities and potential software incompatibilities.\nOther Considerations\n\nUpgradeability: Both brands typically offer access to upgrade RAM and storage, which is a plus for future-proofing your investment.\n\nWarranty and Support: Consider the warranty length and terms, as well as the manufacturer's support reputation in your region.\n\nBattery Life: For non-gaming use, battery life is an important consideration. Check reviews for each model's battery performance under typical use cases similar to yours.\n\nPrice vs. Value: If the ASUS is significantly cheaper and the potential performance differences don't justify the cost for you, especially considering your usage patterns, it might offer better value.\n\nPersonal Recommendation\n\nGiven your interest in SOLIDWORKS, drawing, rendering, and occasional gaming, both laptops will serve you well, thanks to the RTX 4050 GPU. If software legality, better single-threaded performance, and potentially quieter operation are priorities, and the price difference isn't too steep, leaning towards the MSI Cyborg 15A might be the way to go.\n\nHowever, if budget constraints are tighter and you're comfortable managing potential software risks, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 offers great value and durability, especially for rendering tasks that can leverage its multi-threaded CPU performance.\n\nUltimately, consider which features align best with your priorities and whether the trade-offs are acceptable for your specific needs and budget.",
