        "comment": "A benign image of a pizza was uploaded to a third-party website and was then linked with a URL pasted into the ‚Äúabout‚Äù page of a registered Ars user. Buried in that URL was a string of characters that appeared to be random‚Äîbut were actually a payload. The campaign also targeted the video-sharing site Vimeo, where a benign video was uploaded and a malicious string was included in the video description. The string was generated using a technique known as Base 64 encoding. Base 64 converts text into a printable ASCII string format to represent binary data. Devices already infected with the first-stage malware used in the campaign automatically retrieved these strings and installed the second stage.\n\nThe image posted on Ars appeared in the about profile of a user who created an account on November 23. An Ars representative said the photo, showing a pizza and captioned ‚ÄúI love pizza,‚Äù was removed by Ars staff on December 16 after being tipped off by email from an unknown party. The Ars profile used an embedded URL that pointed to the image, which was automatically populated into the about page. The malicious base 64 encoding appeared immediately following the legitimate part of the URL. The string didn‚Äôt generate any errors or prevent the page from loading.\n\nOpening the same file in a hex editor‚Äîa tool for analyzing and forensically investigating binary files‚Äîshowed that a combination of tabs, spaces, and new lines were arranged in a way that encoded executable code. Like the technique involving Ars and Vimeo, the use of such a file is something the Mandiant researchers had never seen before. Previously, UNC4990 used GitHub and GitLab.\n\nThe initial stage of the malware was transmitted by infected USB drives. The drives installed a payload Mandiant has dubbed explorerps1. Infected devices then automatically reached out to either the malicious text file or else to the URL posted on Ars or the video posted to Vimeo. The base 64 strings in the image URL or video description, in turn, caused the malware to contact a site hosting the second stage. The second stage of the malware, tracked as Emptyspace, continuously polled a command-and-control server that, when instructed, would download and execute a third stage.",

Very expensive.\n\n2) If you have a few sites, generally is cheaper to buy CloudFare or Imperva or Akamai and put in front, and prevent leakage of your source IPs. I think cloudfare is relatively cheap for this scenario.\n\n3) Never buy on site protection, they only work in tandem as a trigger mechanism to Scrubbing.\n\nWhat are you protecting? What do u call sites? Websites or Offices with Internet Access?\n\nIf websites why not host in AWS and make it AWS problem?",

Now only being there two years may have a negative affect on that, but location wise I feel you should be slightly higher based on cost of living.\n\nI can see there being a disconnect from a hiring managers perspective on your position and transitioning into anything cyber. Jobs including networking and admin roles are going to want proven experience and I'm starting to see a lot of hires that have previous experience with someone in the company (old coworkers etc). I could see RMF being a good segue for you, potentially even something in the compliance sector. Especially for a healthcare organization. I currently work for a Healthcare Manufacture and they recently doubled the compliance team to keep up with the workload.\n\nMaybe look into certifications for specific software suites that deal with vast amounts of data. Getting good at using those can show as a solid skill if you are looking for more of a technical role.",

We do Tenable Nessus and STIG scanning, but that‚Äôs limited in number of times used. I basically review the compliance of all systems going into these subs from start to finish.

May be in a small size company like OP do not have shilo, but bigger companies have to deal with this crap.\n\nWithout the reporting, it may be difficult for you to persuade people to patch their system. Also, your manager want to see the pretty report as well.\n\nWe used to use Tenable about 5 years ago, and the reporting was horrible. We switched to Rapid7, and doing POC of Tenable and Qualys. Find out Tenable is much better than before. You should check Qualys as well. It has comprehensive coverage for Network devices as well, and is cheaper than Tenable as well.",

Setup new target groups, IP ranges, and dedicated Tenable on-prem scanners, and at best, I still only get around 70% coverage.\n\nReady to rip it out because it's far from giving me the full picture- however I need something that ensures coverage of network devices and non-Windows devices as well.",

Figuring this was tied to the above-mentioned web app fix review, I forwarded that message along to my manager, with context and the JIRA ticket attached explaining why this had probably been triggered.\n\nIt turns out the message was one of those phishing training emails that had coincidentally been timed/themed. While I didn't follow-up by clicking on the link, my manager did when they received the email I forwarded. We both had a good chuckle; then when they had to do the follow-up security training, I figured I should as well in solidarity.\n\nTraining benefits everyone.",

I realize it's probably extremely difficult to empathize with someone who is behaving like this (I feel like you need to be a saint to work in sec) but the fact of the matter is that there is probably going to be a lot more of these kinds of people in any org, so it's always a delicate balancing act...

Do some Microsoft courses, workstation, server, active directory. Build a small environment, test a ton of stuff.\n\nBuild it , break things, rebuild. You can use lab experience on your resume.\n\nHiring manages are looking for attitude, aptitude, and adaptability. In addition, soft skills like critical thinking, curiosity, analyzing, problem solving, troubleshooting, thinking differently, communication skills, leadership, etc.\n\nYou have to talk the talk and walk the walk. By having a lab environment you are showing that you are curious, willing to learn, and proving it.\n\nDo CTFs, read security articles and post comments on LinkedIn and the article link. Show off your knowledge.\n\nI had my now college graduate get Network+, Security+, build our lab environment, apply all that theory, build our active directory, build our VMware server, do a ton of CTFs, post articles on LinkedIn, and other projects.\n\nHe was getting interviews, but always fell just a little short of getting the job, usually lack of experience, Only after adding the lab experience on his resume did he get a killer job.\n\nStick to it, prove you want it, show your willingness to learn.\n\nBest of Luck!!!",

They didn't know how to review packet captures, network logs, device event logs, etc (which is a huge part of being an analyst).

To this day I still don't think there needs to be \"cybersecurity\" degrees, personally I have a CompSci degree and the generality of it is actually more useful than such a specifically-focused degree.

They basically have 1 year of experience X 5.\n\nEdit:\n\nHere‚Äôs an anecdote to illustrate this: at a former org, we acquired a smaller company and were in the process of integrating their Security staff. One guy was acting as their PIM administrator and did help desk level 2/3.\n\nCool, let talk and see if he has experience with tuning role based access controls and wrestling away Global Admin away? Or did he have exposure to Access Reviews or exploring PIM for groups? Or did he work towards standardizing roles for user, or exploring PAM options? Have you documented the process or how would you change it if you could? Nope. After talking to him, he only did the work he was assigned and assigned roles to users and applications carte blanche after getting manager approval. We passed on bringing him on as a security engineer",

Those who have their FY fall on the Calendar year and finishing up their books and most likely are making changes that adjust for the 10% revenue increase that most publicly traded companies will be predicted to hit. At this point, they are shoring up revenue for cost centers and revenue generators.\n\nThe other is if the company's FY falls in line with tax season, it is probably in Q4. So they are in the opposite, where they are scrambling to figure out what can be cut in order to balance the books to either have a solid earning call, or if it is underperforming, lighten the blow.\n\nAt the end of the day, the Officers, C-Suite, and Board of a company ultimately make their generational wealth off the stocks they own in the company...not their salaries\n\nI put that there because everyone needs to remember it. Even if you're in privately held practices, someone holds the reigns to the wallet and is expecting to increase their cash flow based on their investment. So changes will come down hard.\n\nWhy is it hard to land interviews?\n\nAs stated in the above, you now have a candidate pool that has Academic Graduates + Transitioning Employees with experience X Cybersecurity Employees with Experience.\n\nWith the market getting tighter, as evident with layoffs alone, that dwindles many echelon technical positions. So what was once a Principal before Jim left is now a Senior when the req is posted. The candidate pool is now over saturated with at least 2 sets of people in the equation above who are looking to fill the role. Another distinct level of graduates will attempt it. Talent and acquisition will use AI and the other scanning mechanics to dwindle the list to 10-15. Those 10-15 go to Hiring Manager who then select the 5-8. That gets dwindled to the 3-5 that will start the interview process. That will go down to 1-2. And from there the offer based on the interview scores and hiring manager approval.\n\nWhen Will It End?\n\nWe are in a field that has high attrition due to burn out, poor work/life balance, and just overall mental health struggles. I personally believe many of these companies have no intention in filling any of these roles at the present time. They are posting Ghost Positions in the hopes of compiling a pool of candidates for if they get headcount, or someone leaves the company and it impacts work production.\n\nAgain, everything that happens in a company is dictated by the market. C-Suite and Board have the responsibilities to their shareholders, of which most of them make up the overwhelming majority of the held stock. Not many C-Suites come with a cybersecurity background. Heck the degree didn't even exist until very recently when you look at how long formal academics have been around. That means their ultimate question every year at the end of the year is: \"Did we get breached? No? Then why do you more headcount or revenue for products that we already have?\" Is that overgeneralized? Probably a little. But I've sat on calls where CFO's post-breach were all about EDR and MDR solutions, until Year 3 when the question was \"Well...what are we really getting out of this? Nothing has happened since.\"\n\nDon't be shocked when you're hearing murmurs from your peers in the industry saying that their company is remaining flat this year. If anything, you'll see attrition through being pushed out vs. them quitting to free up cash flow as they try to keep the stronger personnel. Which will have a dual negative effect (it always does) because now the stronger personnel are working even harder and then burnout kicks in and they leave.\n\nFrom that point...look at the above paragraphs about why you're seeing layoffs and why it is hard to get an interview. Thus, the cycle.",

If this trend continues, companies in the US will be in big trouble as the veterans age out and there are not enough young people with knowledge to replace them. It will be funny since there will be theories as to why this happened and I am sure none will be true. Companies are trying to cut corners and still don‚Äôt understand that IT is not a Cost Center. It is critical infrastructure and the most important department within the organization. Without IT your company is nowhere. It just won‚Äôt function because 99% of things are automated or require computers in some way.\n\nAs for how long will this last‚Ä¶hard to know. I am not sold on AI because it is trained with biased data which only gets biased results. It also means that technically it is vulnerable.

Eventually SOCs will have software constantly monitoring for indicators of compromise by extracting features in the noise things we know ML is good at. That's just one sub field in cybersecurity but their all going to get their lunch ate by AI.\n\nWriting on the walls that's why infosec is becoming a clown show now. Blue Collar is the new wave not White Collar anymore. Unionized doormen in these big cities like Austin and LA make almost 85k annually and you get better job security. You don't get laid off almost every other year because silicon valley is moving fast and breaking things \"changing their vision\" or whatever the latest dumb buzzword is now.\n\nYou might take a slight pay loss but I rather make high 5 figures with a benefits package that's as good as some of these tech startups and have low amounts of job responsibility. You literally just have to open doors and accept packages for people but people rather work hard then smart. Some are just stuck in a stockholm syndrome relationship with their employer.",

But if you're a SOC analyst and 95% of your job is running automated tools in response to SIEM events, then someone at your company is probably looking to replace you with a script. And let's be honest, those tools are getting better every day. We don't need an in-depth full forensic analysis because Frank in accounting installed yet another \"cute cats lol also coupons\" toolbar. We just need to remediate.\n\nOn top of that, there seems to be a glut of qualified candidates.\n\nThe people who are decompiling malware are fine. The people who are managing compliance are fine. The people who are doing advanced endpoint management are fine. But a lot of the entry-level jobs are vanishing or shifting. It's kind of like the difference between being a sysadmin in 1994 and a sysadmin in 2024, only compressed down to 1/6th the scale.\n\nIf you pull back and look at the bigger picture, I think we're seeing the beginning of the end of the IT era. A company doesn't need to have in-house sysadmins, network engineers, and cybersecurity analysts when they can just hand everything off to AWS or Azure or Oracle or a local MSP or whoever. And honestly, doing so these days makes a lot more sense than it did just ten years ago. IT is right about where US factory workers were in the 1960s. The industry is going to be okay for a while, but we're going to see some serious shrinkage over the next 20-30 years. And that includes Cybersecurity.\n\nThere's still time to make a career out of it, but the door is beginning to close. And the gravy train already left the station. Coasting isn't a viable strategy anymore; people who want to build their career here are going to have to keep learning or immediately sink.",

It's effectively the same thought, but if they're looking for your customer-facing demeanor that might help (at least at my org the first would be much preferred).\n\nDefinitely use analogies, things people can relate to, that show your understanding. Even something like \"that is a unique id for this content, like a primary key in a relational database...\" can make them think \"oh yeah they know what they're talking about, not giving canned answers\". On the other hand though, don't go too deep, don't ramble or talk yourself into a corner, just pause to consider the question, clarify it if needed, and then answer as asked. Consider the whole audience too, if your panel has a technical person and a non-technical person, try to say something for both of them (it's very hard to do this well, just do your best).\n\nThirdly, with that much time, yes your demeanor will be on display for sure, try to build rapport, personal connection with even just one or two on the panel can really help your case when you log off and they later get together to choose who they want to work with.\n\nAnd keep in mind, sometimes whether or not you get the job has nothing to do with how well you do or don't do, they might love you and still it may not work out, don't take it too personally either way.",

Their behavior has been met with repeated criticism, including making false statements (ref: @thegrugq) and renewed claims of plagiarism (refs: news.ycombinator.com c. 2018, reddit.com c. 2021). Due to these incidents, THN links have been banned from several subreddits including r/privacy, r/technology, and r/hacking.\n\nWe would hope that THN is now appropriately crediting sources of its content or writing its own original content, however we are unable to police each and every article.
