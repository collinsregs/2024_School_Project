Not sure if you've checked out that model year or you're basing your comparison with a decade old Mazda. My basis was comparing cars from similar years. I never said the Tesla didn't have a responsive throttle. Heck my other car is an EV - a Mach E GTPE which I recently got and I understand the advantages of an EV with instant torque and benefits of home charging. Tesla and most EVs are great in terms of tech however in terms of the quality of the cars in general especially Teslas from a couple of years back, they're absolutely average to low quality at best. Check out the number of checklist items people give for Teslas and number of complains about panel gaps and rattling on the Tesla subreddits.\n\nSpeaking about the Mach E GTPE, I paid a similar price to a Model Y which I also test drove and in terms of materials and fit and finish it is easily a level above the Model 3/Y. Not sure if you've been in either of those cars but Tesla is nowhere 'luxury' category and I stick by that. Heck I wouldn't even consider my Mach E GTPE as 'luxury' which should tell you where I rate Tesla on that scale.",
