They'll require large groups of well formatted studies to show any useable evidence to back up claims.\n\nMy main concern for this is it's being promoted by crypto currency advocates and crypto is extremely volatile. If this was being promoted by individuals who know the science and have a background in clinical trials but are currently being restricted by certain legal or bioethical limitations that could be overcome by consent of participants in a reliable way, then I'd be a lot more supportive of this type of initiative.",

First of all CGI is a general term for images generated by computers which is a description perfectly fitting the output Sora creates and Ray Tracing is a method of rendering different lighting conditions from a 3D scene on to a 2D plane by tracing the rays from different light sources on to an object to determine the coluour given a whole bunch of parameters, which Sora may or may not utilized to create more or less realistic imagery.\n\nI guess pointing this out to you makes me even more of an asshole in your mind, but I do think that folks need to take the opportunities to baseline educate themselves especially in a sub reddit like this.",

The real challenge is making a high fidelity simulation that approaches reality, not just in terms of the feel of the simulation but in the accuracy of people and events. This is probably inevitable in some ways and impossible in others.\n\nTake a simulation of the future: people can be predicted by algorithms, so with more complete algorithms and modeling, future behaviors could be extrapolated out to as many years and with as much detail as your compute allows.\n\nSimulating the past would get more and more hallucinatory the further back in time you go because of the lack of good quality data to build the models on. Maybe we could do a fairly realistic WW2 simulation, but ancient Egypt could probably only have an accurate simulation of the landscape while the people would be totally made up.

If we had the tech to identify fake photos, we could just use it directly when we need to check the authenticity of a photo.\n\nWhat would work is the camera having a built-in feature where it'd automatically sign photos using a secret key stored in a tamper-proof way. The manufacturer would provide public keys to verify the signature. Arguable downside is that the manufacturer needs to be a trusted party (watch the CEO of Sony get away with murder), but I really see no way around this, any verification external to the camera itself can only ever be as good as our ability to identify fakes in the first place.",

Just that something like that is possible, is still kind of inspiring.\n\nOver the years as it has been co-opted into the system, it became more obvious both the depressing genius and failure of it (or at least Bitcoin) was tying its advancement to human greed.\n\nThat's too aligned with capitalism itself to seriously challenge or transform it, and makes me now wonder what the intentions were of the creator. If you could say a design reflects its creator, it's impossible to rule out that a huge motivation was to get filthy rich, more than truly upset the current status quo. So I guess I was naive earlier on.\n\nBut then again, isn't that how it goes for most revolutions, even successful ones.

A few more years ( or months) of LLMs and Chat integrations and we'll see a decline in visits to websites and a huge shift in how we interact with organizations online.

We already have real world methods like trophy systems to intercept anti material missiles we could put on the robot, especially around weak areas. 2. I don't think ground deformation would be an issue in total war, just like it wasn't in WW2 when we firebombed the hell out of Germany and German occupied france. 3. Soil and metamorphic rock have surprising compressive resistances. The robot is only touching the ground for a brief moment like humans do so it wouldn't deform the rock that much, the mech wouldn't be just standing in quicksand waiting to sink, and even if it was the enormous weight and height of the mech would simply cause it to sink a couple meters at most, how deep do you think swamps get? 4. Concrete has incredible compressive resistances, have you ever seen how much it can hold up, actually the entire point of concrete is that it has compressive resistance in the first place, because if it didn't it wouldn't be able to hold up buildings that weigh 10,000 tons! 5. Building a Mech a couple hundred feet tall would not be any close to the biggest thing that we've tried to build, not even close to the biggest moving thing we have built and that's right now!! The beauty of science is that it evolves over time, the mech will only be a couple thousand tons at most so if you really think about it it's perfectly feasible that science in the future, if it can give us something like a space elevator, can give us something like a Mech..\n\nGive it a chance, there are plenty of arguments against Mechs, Im simply trying to make a point for them\n\nAre you pessimistic about humans and their goal to stop climate change?

We can just add surface area with multiple mirrors (the telescope array) instead of having to build a really big one.\n\nUnfortunately it's not the sun Lagrange point with any planet, it's much much further.

He said, and I agree with him here, that the money spent on the interceptor and its operation would have been better spent on waste management and stopping the plastic pollution at the source.\n\nThe sad thing is that I can understand how the interceptor is the solution that we ended up with, because the political/management problem is too much to actually face it directly. It's what people would be willing to donate to, and on the surface of the river... It's doing something. And tbh before I watched that video I too thought the interceptor was a real fix. Sigh of course they prey our naivete with little regard for legitimate progress on the issues.\n\nSo I would just change those goals towards stopping the pollution before it gets into the river or even onto the ground. Once that hole in the boat is properly plugged up we can confidently get the rest of the water out of the boat without any worries that we will be endlessly chucking buckets of water overboard.",

That effort is growing. Does it remove all of it? No, of course not - much of the plastic is on the seabed and include things like abandoned fishing nets and lines. But the cost of stopping it from entering the water in the first place would cost a few more decimal places.

Everything else in the biome already lives in the shade, and going from getting 33% of the sun's light to getting 32.28% on the typical day can't plausibly cause an extinction.\n\nThat's being generous, in most cases they get much smaller fractions of the light and hence the resultant impact on them would be much smaller.",

I don't have all the data on me right now nor the ability to pull out a scientific calculator and start crunching, however, the current maximum depth for it is some 200 meters. That is not a very big number, and that's going to get multiplied with a fraction of a percentage, so we'll be talking about losing a few centimeters. I can't tell you how many without doing maths (and the 200 figure is an approximation anyway), but that's definitely the ballpark.\n\nIs it a zero impact? No, it's not zero. But it's also really unlikely that there's entire foodchains dependent on a volume of space a few centimeters high, when it is a liquid medium?\n\nIt's clever to think about secondary effects of things like this, but it does seem like this angle, at least, is pretty minor. \"It may not be possible to scientifically measure the impact after the thing is done\" kind of minor.",

If it is a hundreth as bright, you perceive it as a third as bright. A thousandth as bright is seen as a quarter the brightness.

It's also fully reversible, very quickly (assuming the mirrors have some kind of propulsion, and they would need to).\n\nTechnologically it's \"feasible\" (we know how to get to L1, how to fold a space mirror, and managing a \"swarm\" of them would be extremely challenging but far from impossible). On the other hand, it would probably cost literal trillions of dollars and require a gigantic amount of scarce resources. It would also require constant costly upkeep, and getting an international consensus and oversight on such a project would be a diplomatic endeavour for the ages.\n\nBasically, it's \"feasible\" in pure technological terms, but between opportunity cost (you can do a lot on Earth for that kind of money), the resource hurdle, actual effectiveness (you need a lot of mirrors for a noticeable effect) and the difficulty of getting any kind of political traction for it, it's about as practical as bioengineering unicorns who eat carbon out of the atmosphere.",

Amazing if NASA compared to SpaceX is a kind of representative example of other parts of government spending like defense.

But I guess the feeling I have is the heroics of that sparked most of these inventions during a more ambitious era and climate, like the kind of thing that only a government and populate this invested can make happen. The way post war government just built out all the interstate highway systems etc. in a few years which would be impossible for a private company to accomplish.\n\nThe other stuff some comments are saying about NASA having a lot of important but less 'exciting' things for science is also fair, but it does seem like the program overall suffers without this kind of energizing/exciting vision that makes an entire generation dream of it. The alternate space exploration timeline of the past 20 years without SpaceX feels quite depressing.",

If someone from NASA buys a screw, they need to fill out a lot of forms to explain why that screw must be bought, if the price was correct, what alternatives there were for that screw. That is a lot of man hours going towards administrative\nNASA has little control of who they work with and they can't build things in-house, they need to contract it out on a cost plus bases where all cost overruns are charged to them. So they have little control over their own finances. Even more so since they have to pick the more expensive guys sometimes just to please congress. Like remember their pick for Boeing who was most expensive yet failed. They even paid them extra money outside the agreed amount, and they still failed\nWhen NASA builds a launching platform, it only launches once or twice a year. This means their flat costs are high. Companies like SpaceX who do multiple launches a year spread their flat costs",

I wish NASA was more competitive on this modern myth making side today, I miss that, even when it doesn't come through. (Like no alien signal received so far, but I'm glad we are checking.)

They also have a very wide remit including sending probes or rovers to other bodies, the manned space program, rocket and plane design, astrobiology (how does living stuff behave in space, how can it be better, is living in space safe?), the psychology of living remotely in small groups, international compatibility standards, telescopes/receiver networks, etc.\n\nSpaceX are certainly significantly more efficient, but that's because they have a narrower focus, less process overhead, and can build on existing work by NASA and be supported by them throughout.",

Like making sure people can live in space, measuring baseline radioactivity, mapping planets, creating habitability proposals, doing outreach for youngsters, etc.\n\nSpaceX is not concerned with these items. SpaceX (and the many other private space companies) also directly benefit from the groundwork laid by Nasa. SpaceX exists to make money, nothing more. Every dollar SpaceX spends is spent anticipating the money it will make in the future. It does not do primary research. It does not do outreach (of any significance anyway) It does not share and publish it's findings for the world to use. It does not survey the universe or even the solar system for habitable zones. SpaceX makes rockets that go up and come down so it can make money. That is it's purpose.\n\nNasa is important in many ways.

If the goal is to learn as much as we can about our solar system and the universe, sending robots gives a much greater return on our investment. For sending humans, most of the payload is taken up with support to keep them alive. Only a relatively small amount of the payload is for learning about the area where we are sending them. The enormous amount we are spending to send humans to the moon again could be better spent for example sending probes to the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. There will be so much we will miss on learning by not exploring Europa, Titan, Enceladus, Ganymede, Callisto and others to the depth that we could, if we prioritized science over competition. This new emphasis on getting people on the moon now, after 50 years of neglect, let's be honest, mostly because China is going to do it, saddens me and many others no end. I don't think we are saying human space flight is not important, just that it should not be the main focus of our efforts or our funding. If we are talking about military needs, then that is a different issue and should be funded out of the military budget as are, for example, spy satellites.",

If you are looking for a quick answer as to why things went slowly after Apollo, that is half of it.\n\nThe other half is that once the U.S. beat the Soviets to the moon, the amount of public money for space science dried up. While we got quite a bit of bang for our buck, you do not have to be very old to have experienced the moronic idea that somehow investing in space is a waste of money. Is it true? No. In fact it is a wildly efficient generator of technologies we use every day. But politicians have to cater to the middle of the bell curve (at best), so the money dried up anyway.\n\nThis is already changing. The smartest thing NASA ever did was to really privatize space development. Ask ESA what they think of SpaceX, and you will see glassed eyes. NASA is ok with it, because this is their idea and they have already changed their bureaucracy to handle it. Other national space agencies are realizing that they cannot hope to keep up.\n\nSpaceX has already blown up the entire industry. Falcon 9 has made almost every other program into white elephants. Starship, if successful, will upend everything, completely changing the rules of the game. Starlink went from not existing to being one of the most important political instruments in the world in just 2 years. We haven't even seen Blue Origin really get going yet. And there are a half dozen other private companies quickly filling every possible niche. Lumbering bureaucratic monstrosities like we have known since the 50s are already obsolete. Even the private companies that grew fat on cost-plus contracts in the shadow of these beasts are quickly becoming irrelevant (heya Boeing, howya doin'?).\n\nThings are just getting started.

Transitioning an object from stationary on the ground to orbital height and velocity takes a stupid amount of fuel and flawless execution. If the earth had just a little bit higher gravity we would never leave it. If it had a little less gravity, we might be dancing across the solar system by now. But we live on the bleeding edge of “barely possible”.\n\nPeople wonder how we got so quickly from powered flight to space exploration, and the answer was that a lot of breakthroughs happened all at the same time mainly due to military spending. The fun reason we went to the moon was because we could. The practical reason we went to the moon was to tell the Russians “if we can do this, imagine what we can do with ICBMs.”\n\nAnd that was all very impressive, but the massive hurdle of space travel is still there: it takes massive fuckloads of energy to get up there and stay up there. Technology and innovation can’t cancel gravity. The film interstellar articulates this problem well.\n\nMany smart minds believe that the future of space travel depends on creating a way to manufacture rocket fuel off-Earth, most likely the moon. Because the other problem with needing a massive amount of fuel to get off of Earth is that you don’t have much left to go anywhere else — at least not very quickly. And the more fuel you carry, the more you have to lift.\n\nIf we were to build facilities on the moon that can manufacture rocket fuel, then we only ever have to worry about carrying enough fuel to get to the moon.

Returning the stuff to earth adds another layer of complexity. It might be possible in the future, with something like a space elevator that gets rid of the launch and re-entry problems. But we don't really have the technology for that - maybe with ultra-pure carbon nanotubes, but not really. Starship, however, hasn't the capacity to reach it and reenter with enough cargo capacity to make it even remotely worth it. Not to mention that you'd first have to start multiple missions to get the refinery equipment up there as unprocessed cargo will have an even worse return value. Or, to do some basic math, Starship is estimated to have launch costs of about 10 million dollars. For that trip, we'll have to do a refuel in Orbit and other things, but we'll go with 10 million. Starship also has a cargo capacity of about 100 tons. Probably less on that trip since it'll have to carry a lot of fuel for the multiple corrections to land on the asteroid and return back (or match its speed and then accelerate again). A ton of pure nickel is currently at about 17,000 USD. We ignore the iron since that's basically worthless in that equation. So 100 tons will only yield 1.7 Mio. So even assuming conditions that will probably only be reached by a Starship successor in 20 - 40 years and ignoring the orbital refuel and the setup costs to get pure nickel, we not even get 20% back. We can't refine it much further than pure nickel, so it's basically useless on earth. If we were to set up a full production chain in Space, we might use it there, but what's the good of that? Unless we find something that's incredibly rare on earth and easy to extract, the math simply doesn't work at the moment. It all changes with the Space Elevator, but with current development, we are somewhere between 40 years and 2 centuries away from that.",

Their previous jobs made them use to the prospect of their own deaths. They had a proven ability to think on the fly and stay calm when things go FUBAR. They took huge risks in early days of spaceflight and it's shocking only Apollo 1 and Apollo 13 were catastrophes and only Apollo 1 had fatalities. On every single mission in the early era of manned space flight were several near misses. I can't recall for certain but I believe that there wasn't a single flight with out at least one potentially fatal glitch.\n\nFor example:\n\nDuring famous moon landing the decent stage the Lunar Lander almost impacted the surface of the moon because the Apollo guidance computer crashed mid landing. Armstrong's experience as a test pilot allowed him to maintain control of the situation preventing a crash or abort allowing the Eagle to land safely.\n\nWe were always prepared for the worst in these missions. The speech written in case the first lunar landing ended in failure was written and tucked away for many years. Had they died, or been stranded on the lunar surface, this is at least part what Nixon would have said.\n\n\"Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace. These brave men, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin, know that there is no hope for their recovery. But they also know that there is hope for mankind in their sacrifice.\"\n\nWe were prepared for failure would that be the same today? no\n\nWhy?\n\nThree major things changed\n\nThe cold war and its competition between US and USSR space technology ended.\nwe had a few disasters when we thought spaceflight to be routine. The Challenger explosion and Colombia breaking up in reentry due to a damaged heat shield.\nThe people we send up changed.\n\nThe end of the space race and cold war allowed for a more leisurely pace of development it was no longer a competition so we could stop being so mindbogglingly reckless. We now test everything out the wazoo.\n\nWe learned from the mistakes of the Challenger disaster where deciding to go anyway caused the O ring failure that caused the solid rocket boosters to burn through igniting the fuel. They were warned and decided to risk it anyways. We learned from Colombia the need to inspect and redesign instead of accepting known hazards. The ice falling had been known since the shuttle was new and we basically ignored it.\n\nWe're no longer racing we're learning so the current batch of astronauts are scientist. They are not willing or competent to take on the same level of risk as the earlier soldiers and test pilots. They are there to learn and are far better trained in their tasks than any of the earlier astronauts but most lack practical experience in a life or death clusterfuck. We get more scientific information and can run more test as a trade off.\n\nThe reason it's going slower is we decided not to risk the lives of the people so recklessly as we did in the past. We're testing everything because we can't rely on blind luck to safely get a crew to the moon let alone mars. To be blunt? we could go today with the same high level of risk and high danger of failure as the Apollo program but we don't want to which is a good thing.",

We haven't been there because it's expensive and we already did it. There is no reason to do it since we would not gaing anything new. Actually establishing a living colony on the Moon is a much bigger challenge. We are able to keep space laboratories in orbit around Earth because they are much cheaper, easier to resuply, and astronauts can be evacuated much easier. Plus, unless we are able to establish a space economy and keep it cost-effective, we would run ourselves into huge costs we could ill afford to keep paying.\n\nGoing to Mars, again, very tricky. First thing is the effects of 0-gravity on the human body... You would see muscle deterioration after half of year, and going to Mars might require 3 years. Afterwards, effect on the human psychic. Astronauts have families and while it's not uncommon to have families sepparated for a number of weeks or months, consider having them separated for +1 year is a huge commitment. Then, we would require huge logical planning we are not always able to get 100% right, including probably leaving fuel in orbit around Mars. Growing food and keeping a steady oxygen supply are also a challenge. Then, a lot of spacecraft operation is done from Earth and it's also been applied to Mars rovers, but that would need to change when humans are around.\n\nA lot of advancements have been made in space exploration, just not with humans at the moment. We are not willing to send astronauts to their deaths and risk things we are not able to solve at the moment. Considerint the huge advancements with LLMs, we could be sending out more space probes which are able to operate more independently and help us have a better understanding of space and, maybe, solve some of the issues that involve living in space.",

Technologies, called heat in a box, are being used for storing renewable energy as heat.\n\nThere are also electrical solutions emerging for decarbonising steel and cement industries.\n\nUnpaywalled: https://web.archive.org/web/20240218142134/https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/02/15/first-electric-cars-next-electric-factories",

        "comment": "I'm hoping someone figures out AR in my lifetime. Personally I see that as way more useful and attractive than VR. Zuckerberg was on Joe Rogan I think talking about them working together with Ray ban in order to create light weight good looking AR glasses. I think his estimate was 5-10 years out though, and that was before the layoffs and closures.\n\nSome smart person needs to figure out a good interface for it though.\n\nMy initial though would be that you'd have your phone and that does the heavy lifting in the way of computing, and the glasses are just a display and possibly a couple of cameras good enough to map the environment and share my view with people. Don't know if we have wireless communication that's good enough from the bandwidth, latency and low power point of view quite yet though.\n\nLike a concept video I saw of the Microsoft goggles (don't remember the name) a while back. One concept was a virtual screen you attached to a wall or a place that if the quality matched a good TV-set would be awesome. Especially if you could sync it with other peoples glasses close by so you can watch stuff together. Or for companies or working from home you just need your glasses and somewhere to put your computer and peripherals and then you have a portable screen. I'd imagine you could have laptops that do not require a screen. Would do wonders for battery life and form factor.\n\nAnother cool thing (we use this in some locations at my current company, though I don't know if it's as slick as it was in the demo) was an onsite mechanic working on a piece of machinery wearing the AR headset. He's on a call with an expert on said machine who sees a feed of what he sees on his screen. He can then highlight stuff that gets highlighted in the headset, like \"these bolts right here, unscrew them in this order, then this latch opens like this.\" So useful.\n\nAnd then there's potential for AR gaming.",

Imagine being able to tell your brain implants to dig up an obscure happy memory and play it back to you, whenever you want.\n\nI think it'd be fun.

It really only works if you spend the gdp of Eastern Europe on your military and you don't mind eating a few losses of your jets. \n\nRussia tried pulling that off in the early stages of the war but after losing a lot of fancy jets, they switched over to what they're good at, overwhelming artillery focused on certain points and seeing who could bleed more.

Aircraft are capable of doing much more than that. They can strike deep into enemy territory that conventional artillery can't. They are much more adept at making precision strikes than artillery even though the latter is technically still capable of doing so. A heavily entrenched location that might take tens, if not hundreds of thousands of artillery shells to soften up could be neutralised by a couple of GBUs.\n\nIt is funny that you've mentioned Israel, because their airforce was what allowed them to make the massive surprise attack at the start of the Six Day War and gain such an advantage that, well, it only lasted six days. Operation Focus wouldn't have worked if the Israelis had neglected their airforce in exhange for artillery.\n\nSure the French suffered stockpile issues during Libya but that's arguably more of the chronic issue of post-Cold War European nations being massively underequipped in terms of munitions. I doubt their artillery would had done any better under the same intensity, not that they would had even been physically capable of making the strikes that the French Air Force did in Libya.\n\nIt's probably worth nothing that had the Russians actually been competent they should had been perfectly capable of surpressing Ukranian air defenses.",

However, it is very unlikely that Ukraine will be \"fully victorious\" (i.e. take back all territory and fully kick Russia out)—purely because of the imbalance in available manpower and because Russia has no qualms about continuing to feed its male population into the grinder.\n\nSupporting Ukraine happens to align with the prevailing political opinions of the West's populations, but this has never been about helping Ukraine win. As much as it sucks to say, Ukrainians are, by and large, pawns for the Western powers, and for the West, this war has always been about hurting Russia as much as they can via the opportunity that Russia has provided.\n\nNone of this is some grand conspiracy; it's just the same old realpolitik that has been driving major human populations' decisions since forever.\n\nEdit: to recap, no we aren't necessarily trying to help Ukraine \"win\". We're 1. taking the opportunity to hurt Russia for cheap, 2. cycling out our old military hardware, 3. using this war as a live-fire testing range for our new weapons and tactics",

It didn’t benefit anyone except the companies making them and was just a way to test out new toys on people you don’t really care about.\n\nThat being said this isnt going to shorten the war or turn it in Ukraines favour as the largest issues are still manpower and artillery, it’s just going to be a stepping stone for the military industrial complex.\n\nAnd yes, it will benefit Ukraine but if you think for a second that a prototype drone swarm is going to somehow deter Russia more than artillery or tanks or jets then you probably don’t know what you’re talking about.\n\nTLDR\n\ntanks, artillery and jets to win the war? Absolutely not\n\nA drone swarm to mildly inconvenience some Russian general? Hell yes",

The biggest limitations of drones are energy, as batteries are so heavy. With a hose, you have a permanent connection to the source, and could have electrical components at the end too.\n\nNow imagine this snake hose. It can slither through buildings. When it reaches a door or obstacle, it can cut or blast its way through with water pressure.\n\nIf it discovers a conscious person, it can spray a fire suppressing water shield around and guide them back safely. Or they can just follow the hose if it's safe to do so. \n\nFor unconscious people, it can gently coil itself around and drag them back. Or if that's not safe, it can summon responders.\n\nObviously that's a way from what we have now, but I'm just trying go demonstrate how you can never thing of future tech in front of current tech. Like, how vehicles will couldn't to run as fast as horses because the leg mechanism is too complex... So you forget about the legs and find a better solution like the wheel + road/track",

When I was an attorney thirty years ago, we had secretaries who would transcribe our dictation (on cassette tapes.) One old feller had a STENOGRAPHER to take dictation. Now we have voice recognition, and anyway, lawyers probably do their own typing on computers now, I don't know. But they still need secretaries. It's just that their job duties have changed.\n\nI think the same will happen with AI. Even very high touch, subtle jobs like artist or social worker will be affected by AI.\n\nBut that's been true of every disruptive technological change, which has been continuous for the last, I dunno, 150 years?

Grade 11-12 suddenly all course content is available from the start of the year via completely filled out slides online. Note taking is optional. Stop paying attention, start showing up late or not at all where I could; easy 90s and I was accepted into every university I applied to with scholarships.\n\nI am a Canadian living in Ontario and we have some of the highest international test scores outside East Asia, higher than most European countries. Outside of special education, we can replace teachers with childcare workers. As it stands some sort of hybrid model allowing WFH was already feasible years ago. Teachers will rent seek though, need that safety net when you can't actually do anything else your degree was supposed to prepare you for.",
