That means with your upper most leadership, you with have a higher than normal people who are either there by passion or because they struggled to cut it with the same roles in private. In both those cases, that means you have some really big personalities, and they can very heavily influence the viewpoint of your organisation.\n\nIn our roles, we also have the difficulty of getting caught up in the weeds. Confirmation bias means that we start to see every High risk as The Biggest Issue In the Department, when the leadership are seeing high risks from the business perspective just as often. Because of that, we often struggle to communicate the security requirements and security concerns in a way those people really understand what the real impacts to the organisation are, and they have too much personality to admit it.\n\nThat gives you a storm where yes, the leadership thinks security is important in moderation and balance, but their balance is skewed in a different direction to our own because their ego wants to see them leave a mark, and security doesn‚Äôt leave a mark. Then one person‚Äôs perspective on this influences everyone else at that leadership level because Strong Opinion Personality.

For each machine, I would write the name and techniques used to exploit the machine in the title. I did the same thing for any HTB, vulnhub, etc machine I practiced on. Just being consistent with one style will help.\n\nNow, for the actual exam, I think it‚Äôs important to just realize that your note-taking methodology can be applied to your investigative process. Your actual notes from when you are learning will probably be less helpful since you‚Äôll more than likely encounter something you haven‚Äôt necessarily seen before.",

Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[6][7] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.",

Because if you upgrade Apache to get rid of that vulnerability, then the web app that is running there won't work because the devs for the app haven't made it work properly with the new version (or whatever).\n\nSo now you have a vulnerability that's just sitting there. You scanned it, you know about it, but you can't patch it.\n\nSo now you have to manage it as part of your plan. You document that it's there. You run a risk analysis. You determine if your existing mitigations are sufficient. You add mitigations as needed.\n\nAnd THEN, someone in executive management needs to sign off to accept the residual risk in light of the potential likelihood and impact of exploitation.",

There are not enough people to constantly chase after CVEs. Even with a large team, it's easy to miss a CVEs if not using a tool. A vulnerability scanner is the only way to go. However, a scanner will only search for potential misconfiguration and missing patches. There are vulnerabilities that are neither misconfiguration nor missing patches. Those are done by humans. In addition, we all subscribe to different forums, so we use those to see what the new vulnerabilities are out there.\nRegularly. I require that my team (InfoSec) and the system owner review it on at least a bi-weekly basis.\n\nA joint effort between InfoSec and the system owner. As a CISO, the responsibility for the system's security falls upon the team that owns it. InfoSec is there to be more of the \"auditor\" and ensure they follow policy and procedures. However, I have always stated that when \"shit hits the fan\" - I don't care about the blame game.\nFor Scanner, I have used both Tenable.io and Qualys. I like Tenable.io better. For managing the vulnerabilities, I use Tenable or Qualys. However, for risks, I have a risk registry.\nVaries depending on the size of the organization.

After all information security is merely a supporting function for the actual business activity.

All automated tools, including but not limited to Arc connected-servers, qualys, tenable, etc. often only process immediately actionable vuln items. That means nothing more than the tools deliberately or by mistake filtering out valid vulnerabilities, be it because there‚Äôs no fix available or due to other issues. Especially tenable is notorious here. Every couple of weeks I‚Äôve to override it‚Äôs findings because I run into issues such as (hypothetical) HAP 2.0+ was never available on CentOS8 by default so our script won‚Äôt check at all.\n\nAlso, for a free and quick overview of persistent vulnerabilities without fixes, a wazuh instance can be dropped within minutes.

Certainly, Cybersecurity salaries are MUCH higher than average pay, including CEO pay for example.\n\nSalaries are higher in Ireland than Poland for example, in some cases by 10X but portable skills like IT and Finance see difference of 20-50%\n\nAnother reason is cost of living. For an equivalent living standard of $300k in NY, I need only $140k in Ireland - cost of food, entertianment and healthcare.\n\nRent of a 2-bed apartment and montlhly healthcare in NY is about $80k - in Ireland thats $25k. Thats a huge difference.\n\nGad and cars are cheaper, food quality is lower in NY in my opinion but ymmv.\n\nBut the US is a very high cost economy and needs a base salary of $50-70k - which is actually the higher rate of pay in most Western EU countries and the UK.

It has a lot to do with taxes and more importantly mandatory social security.\n\nIn many EU countries, employer cost for an employee is twice as much as the gross salary the worker gets and that gross pay also gets taxed. In much of it, $1 cost on the employer side ends up being $0.20 take-home on the worker side.\n\nThere are a lot of other reasons why the US pays more and you mentioned some of them. But taxation in the EU definitely is a large part of it.

I'll say it one last time, to stay on point but US taxes do not set European Salaries - and the fact that they range by 200% is evidence of this. You have tried to claim that the US is the biggest employer in Europe, it is not. Employees of Aemrican companies earn salaries local to their markets. Because thats how salaries are set. Thats what I've said, thats what hanppens if you Google it.\n\nSwitching and smuggling arguments are examples of logical fallacies.",

These same intangibles makes it difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison.\n\nI'm an American who's lived in BC, Canada, so I'll use these two as an example. Everyone knows Canada has universal healthcare and American healthcare is expensive. What people might not realize is healthcare is actually more accessible in the US (albeit much more expensive) than it is in BC.\n\nBC did not allow any private practice doctors nor any part time doctors when I lived there. You either worked full time for the health authority or you didn't work as a physician. Between that and the ~1mil/yr immigrants and you have colossal pressure on the healthcare system. Some places like Nanaimo tell their citizens to just go to Urgent Care if they need any medical treatment, as it's unlikely they'll get a PCP anytime soon.\n\nSo on paper, Canada does look like the superior option with its cheap universal healthcare. In reality, you'll almost certainly have issues accessing healthcare if you land in BC. Conversely, you can easily access healthcare in the US within hours/days, but you'll be paying for it much much longer.\n\nIt's the same tradeoffs everywhere in the world. I argue people who argue \"X\" country is superior to \"Y\" country in the developed world haven't done their research properly.",

How does that work?\n\nSalaries are set by scales in each country according to jobs and available works or supply and demand.\n\nTL;DR - ARGUE THIS POINT:\n\nMost people working in Euroep work for European companeis - why would US taxes make those jobs pay less?\n\nIf the average wage in spain is Eur30k, the taxes at 20% are 20% of that salary - that is NOT dictated by salaries or lower taxes in the US.\n\nThe High Tax Band IS NOT YOUR TOTAL TAX\n\nIreland has a 22% and a 40% tax band - most employees DO NOT EARN THE HIGHER TAX BAND\n\nEuropean High Tax bands are NOT EQUAL\n\nIreland has a lower high tax entry point than the UK or Germany\n\nTAXES =/= Social Benefits\n\nThis is a separate charge and is similar to the US - around 10%",

Panel interview consisted of running a gauntlet of 5 people for 50 minutes each and then 10 minute break between. If one of the panel doesn't like you, you don't get handed off to the next person.\n\nI didn't get that job.\n\nI heard from the hiring manager the bar raiser killed my candidacy.\n\nThat person wasn't very professional or respectful to begin with so I was okay with it even though I was disappointed I failed the interview. The manager told me later, and I don't think he was supposed to do this, the feedback was otherwise great but the bar raiser can kill it for the other 6. That's how it goes with the bar raiser.\n\nI get a call back 3 weeks later. Amazon recruiter tells me that feedback was great from the previous interviews and they want to consider me for another position.\n\nRecruiter also tells me that I can go through an abbreviated interviewing process. requiring only a manager screen and a panel of three this time.\n\nSo I go through the next 4 rounds -- which if one is keeping score is 10 interviewers met with thus far.\n\nAnother week goes by. I called the recruiter. They said they were still discussing the results.\n\nI fucking snapped. I told the recruiter that if I've met with 10 people, 9 think I'm awesome, and Amazon still cannot make a decision, then stop jerking me around and take me out of consideration and delete my information from their system.",

The team is also really good about letting you move your schedule around to accommodate other life stuff you have going on.\n\nI‚Äôve heard some negative things from the software dev side of the house, who I assume is under lots of pressure, but I hadn‚Äôt heard much negative from the security side. I‚Äôd say the only negative I‚Äôve had was that I had to hit the ground running so fast that I feel like I‚Äôm still learning some basics, which makes me nervous that I may not be doing my full due diligence, which feeds into my terrible impostor syndrome.

This person regularly clocked 60 hour weeks while managing a whole team and pulling on-call duty. Most companies would've wanted to clone my boss a dozen times. Accenture fired them for being too expensive, they were making $85K. If you can't keep someone who's very skilled and working their guts out employed then your entire business model is flawed.",

Nothing inherently wrong with those companies or roles, and they're probably great as a first role in the industry to build experience. I've just never experienced more burnout in my life than when I was scrambling to work alerts from across a shitload of environments for 10 hours straight every day for 6 days a week.",
