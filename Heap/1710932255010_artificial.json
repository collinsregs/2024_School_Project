A corporation specifically set up to hold land in a country, but with minimal other assets in that country after purchasing said land..ie back to Ireland etc.), though I was too losses in using the term wealth tax , so apologies for that. My objection was to \"letting capitalism do it's thing\". Capitalism doing it's thing is incompatible with a redistributive wealth tax. Sorry, but IMO the economy needs guardrails. Capitalism being allowed to do what capitalism does, without guardrails, will easily find a way around or at least render ineffective a redistribution tax. Ever tried putting your thumb over a drop of water and pressing down? See how the water squirts out in every direction and almost nothing is left under your thumb? I expect that would be the result of allowing capitalism to \"do what it does\" unfettered, and expecting to be able to apply a redistributive tax on the end result.",

You don't win an election by having the best voting record or best economic plan. You win by telling an engaging story, with the right feelings, good guys, bad guys, dramatic arc, etc. You can make it funny, scary, urgent, dramatic, etc. You might tell a story about how immigrants or AI or global warming or the other party are a threat to the nation. You humanise it and dramatise it. A good story has to hit you in the gut - it's feelings, not logic.\n\nAdvertising works the same way: it's story telling.\n\nOf course AI's can be trained on the best orator and story-tellers who ever lived. Also the best salesmen, and most charismatic political and religious leaders who ever lived.\n\nAI's can tell very convincing stories, and because the web collects so much information on us, we can each receive a story custom-tuned to our own personalities and prejudices.\n\nWe will all be putty in AI's hands.",

It's bloodless and intellectual.\n\nBut the right wing gets that an election is showmanship, story-telling and emotion. Fundamentally Mussolini's Marcia su Roma (March on Rome) hardly happened - sure the blackshirts marched, but the story of it was much bigger than the actual event and that was what brought Mussolini to power, and ushered in Fascism in Europe. Hitler, years later, was a Johnny-come lately but his Nuremberg Rallies, Trump's rallies, January 6, and all that are cut from the same emotional cloth, full of rage and sweat. The American Democrats and UK Labour hardly break a sweat at their gatherings. All over the world the right is in the ascendancy because they're charged up and full of crazy passion and blood lust.

If you get this wrong then that is an unbelievable risk to your company. Why would you get it wrong? Because we know AI hallucinates. It makes things up that aren't real. Imagine you wrote a document with regulatory guidance based on an interpretation of the law that isn't based in the actual language. We know AI does this.\n\nIf you're using it to create visualizations, process data, or draft points based on outlines or notes... that's all fine. If you're using it to summarize legal documents, I would personally give you one warning to never do that again and if you kept doing it I would fire you.\n\nI may be reading too much into that one line in your post, but I'm going to assume your boss is generally a reasonable person which is why this disagreement is jarring.

Then you feel you need to pad that report as you've spent two weeks on it with a bit more text. Sure, the five lines may be the important info, but for what you cost, it seems a bit excessively compact... So you end up restating the same things half a dozen times, adding filler with appropriate jargon, sprinkling in some ELI5 text for the conclusions in case someone needs that.\n\nBasically, a case for generating bulk filler text where generative AI can do pretty well. Fast and of limited value, but might be entirely satisfactory if the main point actually is adding that kind of bulk.\n\nBut if you remove the guy coming up with those lines of actual content, you end up with only the valueless part.\n\nIt would probably be more productive to take a frank discussion and just quit it with the useless extra text.

As my writing subject matter expert; Examine the following quoted information \" COPY/PASTE/INSERT YOUR INFORMATION THAT YOU WANT EDITED HERE \" and edit this information to make it more compelling, readable, appealing, relevant, and exceptionally well regarded amongst my target audience \" INSERT YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE HERE, AND BE SPECIFIC (E.G. OBESE CONSERVATIVE WOMEN AGED 60-75 WHO LIVE IN Columbus, OHIO) \". Be sure your edits are of exceptionally high, top-talent quality, of the utmost perfection.\n\nDouble check your work, and use evidence-based information in generating a response. Do Not generate incorrect information. Generate only correct information. Do not generate anything I have not asked you to generate. Be accurate, precise, and correct.\n\n‚Äã\n\n‚Äã\n\nfeel free to get creative with any custom instructions (e.g. Write your edits in a conversational tone. Or make sure the edits follow APA style, and have a calm, personal, and friendly tone. Or make the edits sound passionate, angry, and filled with justice and outrage\".",
