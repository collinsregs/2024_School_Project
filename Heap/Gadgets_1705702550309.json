As piracy regains popularity we'll probably see new road block get put into place, and with so much free and cheap content available there isn't much motivation for a lot of people to spend trying to get around them.\n\n\"Piracy Is More About Convenience Than Price\" goes both ways.",

It's a little trickier these days with system firmware updates every couple of months playing cat and mouse with exploits and \"always online\" systems that you have to manually deactivate to prevent your console being bricked, but if you can read and follow simple instructions it's nowhere near the rocket science people seem to think it is.",

Just recently I pulled mine out, looked into it, and I literally had to stick a couple of files on a flash drive, plug it in, then run a file from the menu and viola. Suddenly I can play all those exclusive PS3 games that people are charging $600 for on the resell market without going broke. I'm told that PS4 is getting to that stage as well and I'm half tempted. Apparently the 360 is fairly simple to mod, and the Wii/Wii U are piss easy. When you get back to more classic consoles it's more of a crapshoot. Stuff like the NES/Genesis/N64 only need a flashcart to play their entire library and then some, while the disc-based consoles might require a piece of third-party hardware and a boot disc to get it running stuff off of a hard drive or back-up disc. That said, I straight up \"modded\" my Sega Saturn with a piece of duct tape. You just have to tape the cover indicator down so it thinks the lid is always closed, run a legit disc until it verifies, then swap it out with a back up and there you go. \"Hacked\" Saturn.\n\nHonestly though, if you're gonna go to the trouble, Wii/Wii U will play Gamecube natively along with basically any console generation before it via emulation, and Playstations usually have the power to emulate older generations of their own line, even if it might not be quite perfect. If you've got one particular console that you really enjoyed back in the day with a lot of your favorites native to it, go for that and turn it into a multi-system gamehub via emulation.\n\nIt bears pointing out that doing it during a consoles life span is a fair bit trickier, because there are often multiple people making different iterations of CFW that operate differently, sometimes developers pack it up and quit and if you were using their version you have to jump through hoops to convert to another type, constant firmware updates mean you have to be careful you don't update past what can use CFW currently, certain homebrew will break once you update CFW and you have to wait for that to be updated, and that's not even getting into modern games that require a certain firmware edition to be playable, so sometimes you have to wait to play new games to not lose CFW access, and other times people will find a way to patch it to play on lower firmware. It's a whole thing, and you have to stay pretty on top of it to not be lost when you do want to update.\n\nBasically, if you're looking at classic consoles then you won't have much trouble at all. Just google \"[insert system here] custom firmware\" and you'll probably trip over six different tutorials that you can read over to make it super easy. Unless you're dying to mess with the latest hardware and see how hard you can push it's limits, don't worry about them, because it'll be a whole ordeal and is often rife with developer drama for no good reason.",

Some obscure game has a flaw that allows the loading of third-party software, shoots up in price, Nintendo patches it, another backdoor is found, rinse repeat a few times, then someone discovers that you can get the system into recovery mode by using a straight up magnet to trick the system into thinking it's closed. They've developed easier software-only methods since that take advantage of built-in basic software on the system, but even if Nintendo pushed another update at this point to address it, we'll always be able to put custom software on the system with a fridge magnet, and there's nothing they can do. It literally cannot be fixed.\n\nEven if they found a way to patch the firmware to eliminate current methods, someone would find a new way. I've been an enthusiast of custom firmware for decades at this point, and I've watched people endlessly roll into discussions talking about how a system is \"unhackable\" and there will never be custom firmware, then half a year later there it is. Then they start talking about how the latest update will never be exploited, and a month after that update has an exploit found. There isn't a piece of software in the world that can't be exploited, modified, hacked, or worked around given knowledge and dedication.\n\nThe fact that the 3DS has a straight up physical feature that makes it fully exploitable is actually kinda rare in the modern age. The Wii/Wii U don't have the same kind of hardware \"flaw\", but part of the way their basic programming works just leaves them easily exploitable, no matter what Nintendo tried to update. Programmers caught on a long time ago and when they found useful exploits they didn't tell anyone and waited until a final update was pushed to systems to say \"Okay, so here's this thing the creators missed and now that they're done we can hack all updates and versions of this system.\" It happened with the PSVita, and even when Sony pushed out a surprise firmware update afterwards it didn't solve the problem. The fact is, nothing is unhackable, and the internet will always outnumber corporate programmers.\n\nAdd on to that the fact that you can't ever scrub something entirely from the internet, and that taking down one resource just means two more will take it's place from a database backup, and online e-shops for the 3DS aren't going anywhere. They might go down for a short time, but something will always replace them. Nintendo thought they got rid of piracy when they dropped a ton of lawsuits a few years back and nuked some famous, long-standing sites, but all they did was make people more creative, and now it's easier than ever to find whatever video game you want with google and a pinch of common sense.\n\nBasically, nothing is ever going to make game consoles unhackable, even hardware revisions, and nothing is ever going to scrub piracy from the internet. This free-shop ain't going anywhere.",

Done and Done.\n\nWiiU may not have been popular, but its freaking awesome for hacking. It will play almost everything and GameCube/Wii games dont even need emulation as they use the same OS as the WiiU. Connect a 1TB external SSD and have enough room for almost every GC/Wii/WiiU game, everything else can be stored on the SDHC. You can even buy adapters that let you connect N64 or Sega controllers to your Wii Remote. The Gamepad controller even upscales old NES-N64 roms, making them more playable.",

If that is no longer the case, or those costs can't be justified, it needs to be paid for by someone else.

This gimmick will die in no time, people can just buy a camera.\" And of course, here we are. Nearly every older \"common sense\" person was simply wrong about that. Then the iPhone came, and everyone over 40 once again was so obviously wrong about that too. I think past a certain age you just think \"this new gimmick can't be something\" even when it obviously will be.\n\nAI will be the same spiel. There will be some folks who say \"meh, AI buzzword marketing mumbo jumbo it's nothing anyway\" but by this time next year every single device that can run some type of LLM AI will be doing that.

Pretty soon I'll be able to tell my phone to send emails, calls, texts, make appointments, and it won't be some god awful thing like Siri where you have to robo-speak slowly and clearly, and then do the actual tasks step by step mostly yourself- it will be truly automated and seamless. And it will be huge.\n\nAnd then people like you will be like \"well no one could have seen it coming or just how important it would become to daily life!\"\n\nAnd then it will start replacing people's jobs, as we all know it will.

I know people love their iPhones so this isn't a slam on them but I personally find it awkward and annoying to work with. I have a work-issued iPhone and some of the core features (\"swipe down from the top ... no not from that top, the other top ... no on the other side of the top ... no not that side the other other side\") drive me nuts. People should use whatever phone they like but for me personally, iOS is just a huge hassle.\n\nBut adding a subscription fee gets us a lot closer to a tipping point where I have to choose between being annoyed at iOS, or being increasingly annoyed at AND paying additional fees to use Android. And I can probably just re-learn my usage habits to match iOS.",

Alas, they're audacious in all the wrong places - ditching the headphone jack because Apple did, selling phones without the charging brick cuz Apple did, setting the phone prices sky-high because - yup you guessed it - Apple did it with their $1000 trend iPhone X onwards.\n\nWorse, they're failing to provide reliable software and security updates, consistently less stellar software and hardware experience, and the list goes on. Now, Samsung doesn't have strong MVPs with their S24 series lineup against Apple's 15 series. So when I read about the new AI tricks, I thought this would help them as they worked with Google to bring some pretty neat, useful and exclusive features to their new phones. But there it is, you gotta pay for that in addition to a friggin $1300 for the Ultra. I'm sure that'll work out well for them.\n\nIn so many of the aforementioned aspects, many Android devices could offer something beyond what Apple does that's also less pricey and flaunt that advantage in their marketing. They have some great perks with Android in how practical, customisable, operational it is, and yet they seem to fail to see it and keep making things worse.\n\nKnow your place and turn that into the desired destination.",

But when Xiaomi wanted to charge 1k for mi series phone, Samsung similarly while having constant issues and having 30gb of bloatware on 128gb phone I looked at apple. Well, iPhone 13 mini costed me less than xiaomi or Samsung, is actually in perfect size for me (god I hate these >6‚Äù screens) and tbh I‚Äôm amazed. Simple, clean UI, not much garbage apps you cannot uninstall, no ads in system itself, the engineering behind phone itself is amazing and everything just simply works. It‚Äôs totally different experience. Even though iOS is supposedly closed system I still feel I have more freedom on it that on ‚Äúopen‚Äù android where I‚Äôm flooded with ads and unwanted apps. Also apple has nice feature of 5 years of updates after sale of certain model ends. Which android phone provider offers that?\n\nApple is able to provide well made software for their products because they have 4 models per series + once every few year SE series based on insides of current iPhone. The cameras are pretty much the same in all models but they squeezed everything from them softwarewise. Android phones have many more models per year and cameras marketing catch is amount of mpx, not actual results. Softwarewise it‚Äôs meh. With limited amount of hardware in circulation apple can focus on improving the iOS, if they had 20 different models each year like xiaomi or Samsung it‚Äôd be impossible to do so",

And I'm not really bothered by the fact the android phones I buy cost more than the top end iPhones. Although I did switch away from Samsung when they decided to start charging $1600 for the Note line.\n\nBut even I'll say that I'm not too sure how much innovation Samsung is doing now. I had to upgrade my fold z 4 to a fold z 5 because my hinge started going bad. And I would literally pick up my old 4 by accident and use it (without opening it) and not realize I wasn't on the new phone. The differences are so minor that I couldn't tell which one I was using unless I looked very closely to try and tell them apart.",

There are chipsets with AI built in, limited as it may be, that do exactly that. It's only Intel right now, but that's just a matter of time until everyone else jumps on the bandwagon.
