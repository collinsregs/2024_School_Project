The problem is that it's impossible to write functions that work fine either way.\n\nThink about data transformation functions that take an input like `sort` or `findBest` or `join` or whatever. You can't (in a simple way) have the same function take an input that's either a synchronous value or a Promise (or hey, maybe even an Array<Promise>). If you want a version that works on promises then usually you'd write a 2nd version of the same function that is async. But conceptually the function is doing the same thing and maybe we'd be more productive if the one function could work fine either way. That's the problem.\n\nAlso a function like that doesn't need to \"signal to the programmer that something effectful is probably happening inside that code\" because that isn't true. Being async doesn't imply that it's effectful.",

Worse than WebP lossless and sometimes even worse than PNG. JXL lossless is the best available (although browser support is limited, unfortunately, so you'd still need a WebP and/or PNG fallback).\nWhile JXL animated mode exists, and compresses better than GIF, it still has the same fundamental issue of animated GIF: you are using an image format to store video. It's almost always better to use an actual video file (even with an old codec like H.264), as those can efficiently represent only the differences between consecutive frames instead of storing each frame independently.\nJXL has a unique feature which is that, in a special mode, it can recompress an existing JPEG file with no quality loss (with any other format, you would either use lossy mode and get worse quality, or use lossless mode and produce a bigger file than the JPEG). The resulting JXL file can be decoded into pixels by anything that supports JXL, or it can also be decoded into a byte-for-byte identical copy of the original JPEG file. Useful if you have a big collection of JPEGs and don't want to compromise on quality.",

There's little incentive to try to change an organization's culture or ways of working and may even be disincentives.

It's all of the other shit that has nothing to do with software development.\n\nTo quote someone else:\n\nThe fact that the company wants to use you for everything from part time product manager to project manager to support engineer and somehow have you make progress on features in your spare time between a million meetings.\n\nBefore I was doing all of those things, deadlines were nothing to me. Writing the code, testing it, building features, those aren't the problems, even under strict/tight deadlines. I've had stuff dropped on my plate that were due a day later and it was no big deal (unless the ask was impossible, which is a different discussion). It's all of the other shit that gets dropped on you after being with a company for a few years. It's why software developers are often in revolving doors. Some will do it for money, but others will do it because it's the only way to keep doing the work you actually want to do, and not picking up the slack for the things that were never part of your job definition to begin with.",

Those reading and answering the poll are going to be the ones more engaged, and honestly they‚Äôre going to be the ones that are more likely to be programming in their off time. I would bet that they also tend to skew heavily toward younger and more junior roles and those newer or not as established in the industry. If I asked my peers with kids and families (and, get this, we actually talk about our lives outside of work!) they would say they don‚Äôt write code outside of work hours as a general rule. I know this because we‚Äôve had this exact discussion before.\n\nI‚Äôve been in the industry for 20 years. I do a lot of high level planning and design. I don‚Äôt write code every day and it‚Äôs rarer that I write code in a day than it is that I do. I help my teams by unblocking them before they know that they‚Äôre stuck. I have been doing some embedded systems work for fun around the house, but I enjoy that because it‚Äôs pretty much the opposite of the large web-scale applications I work on as a part of my day job. My peers are definitely in a similar boat. If we are writing code outside of work, it‚Äôs because we want to and we‚Äôre definitely not going to be sharing to the world or hoping to make a living doing it. It‚Äôs just for our own curiosity.\n\nFrankly, I personally worry about people who are spending so much of their free time selling the same thing they do at work. Find a different hobby. Find another outlet, another way to be creative, to express yourself. You‚Äôll find more happiness and be more productive and efficient, in my experience, when you limit yourself. It‚Äôs the same reason I hate take home interview questions and projects and I hate programming tests. It devalues time. You don‚Äôt expect a tradesperson to spend all their free time doing their job. Nobody expects a plumber to spend all day at work and then to come home and replace the shower and toilets and main valve. Nobody expects an electrician to spend all day at work and then come home and rewrite their house for fun. Why do we expect the same out of programmers?",

I'm big into super hot peppers, so I wouldn't mind growing peppers and making hot sauces.\n\nI grew up on fish farms and around other livestock farms. That shit sucks. My dad loved it though. But I have some cool unique experiences, like when we used to donate our dead fish to a big cat / exotic animal rescue. It was a private facility and I'm pretty sure there was a blip of the place on the first season of The Tiger King, but owned by someone else. That rescue wasn't featured though, it just showed it for a minute or two and I forget why. If you watched that show, those are basically trying to get any kind of free food they can all the time because it costs so much. We used to put aside the fish we'd find floating or picked out by birds and throw it in our side freezer then make a delivery about once a month. This big cat rescue was mostly pumas, but he had 3-4 Tigers and a male Lion who was neutered before puberty and had no mane.",

The author compares it to Kotlin's scope functions and appreciates its syntactic simplicity. Criticisms of with(), such as readability issues, scope leak, and performance challenges, are discussed. Alternatives like destructuring assignment are considered less effective from a readability and semantic perspective. The author suggests a modified version of with() that doesn't search the prototype chain to improve performance. Historical context and potential use cases are also explored, arguing against universally discouraging with().\n\nIf you don't like the summary, just downvote and I'll try to delete the comment eventually üëç",

Prevention is way cheaper and better than mitigation. ¬†\n\nDo you not buy insurance either because nothing broke so far?

But in that case nor will 2FA. 2FA only helps against guessing password. Nothing else.\n\nYou are arguing for a case where password authentication is badly programmed and allows access, but the code for 2FA is instead written correctly. That is indeed possible, but just as possible that the 2FA code would be bugged as well.\n\nAs I said, the CHANCES of getting hacked are much lower than the chances of my phone breaking. And until recently there was no way to migrate 2FA seeds from the official android app.\n\nSure if you are some kind of authentication nerd, you will not use the official app, you will back them up‚Ä¶ but need to set up a secure way to do that‚Ä¶ but authentication nerds own yubikeys so this is all moot. 99% of people will use the official app, so that's the one we have to focus about.\n\nI'm not saying i'm safe. I'm saying that there is a much higher chance of losing access to my account due to lost device than to hacking.\n\nMost websites ask me to print those security codes to retrieve the account. Good‚Ä¶ but I don't own a printer, so I have to print in a library or such‚Ä¶ which means the network administrator of the place can now steal my account. Or I can not print them and accept that my account can easily be lost instead, with no way of ever retrieving it.\n\nPS: pls quit making ill-fitting comparisons‚Ä¶ 2fa is not an home alarm and it is not health insurance. Also, I am lucky enough to be born in a civilised country where I don't need health insurance.",
