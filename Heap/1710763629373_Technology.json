Trump stated (and restated as recently as last year) that he could grab women by the pussy because his own fame and fortune gave him that privilege - he meant he could do that to YOUR daughter, wife, mother, sister, girlfriend, and aunt too.\n\nDo you not believe Trump has this same selfish disdain for our democratic principles, processes and institutions? Vote to protect democracy and family values - don't vote to protect the value of the rapist's family.\n\n\"Consequently, the fact that Mr. Trump sexually abused - indeed, raped - Ms. Carroll has been conclusively established and is binding in this case.\" See page 13 of the Judge's decision ... https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.543790/gov.uscourts.nysd.543790.252.0.pdf\n\nMore questions about Donald J.

We aptly named a weight off wheels switch test the dime test because a dime is the same thickness as the approved measurement from using the approved measuring tool.

It puts the whole airworthiness of a plane in question, because... who knows what other things are not according to process, who else is not stopped, maybe one of them actually is critical?\n\nThe shopfloor colleagues should not be the ones to define what is a safe process deviation and what is not. Our manufacturing once had the idea to wipe a part surface with hand protection cream prior to bonding brackets, because it made cleanup easier, to give you an idea of what some people consider a save process deviation. In this case here, Maybe the soap is too aggressive for the seals. Maybe it's not today, but the next batch \"now with spring scent\" is. You don't know.\n\nIf you want to deviate from the process, tell engineering and get the deviation approved and added to the process.",

For example, stating to ensure a gap of no more than .10” means just that. I can use a ruler, calliper or any other item known to be over the maximum size. If it was as specific as stating use go/no-go measuring tool (item #X), then I can only use that tool. Same goes for a leak check, it could be as vague as pressurize aircraft to 10,000ft and check aft emergency exit door seal for signs of leak or it could be as specific as stating use leak detect (item #XX) to check for signs of leak at aft emergency exit\n\nOutright using improper procedures or tools is wrong but it happens daily. You can only stop the ones you see or hear about. Pulled a few qualifications in my day and never felt bad about doing so. If you can’t be trusted, you shouldn’t be working in the aviation industry",

Google is not monetizing Gemini (yet) and it’s unclear how, when and how much return will it bring to their balance. Also, the market is very young and OpenAI might be too risky as a choice considering recent management and board changes. Apple will possibly pay for Gemini and not the other way around.\n\nApple built the iPhone when the search engine market was well stablished, it had an excuse not to have their own solution but today is completely inexcusable for them not to be in the gen AI space. There’s a reason they bought the company that created Siri: smart assistants are crucial to the iOS experience.\n\nTim Cook fucked this one up IMHO.

A surprise that also makes it clear that the firm with the bitten apple is suffering delays that, presumably, will prevent it from launching iOS 18 equipped only with its own functions.\n\nGoogle is not the only option, but it is the most plausible. Since Apple would not have enough AI resources to confront Google, it is studying the option of signing a licensing agreement with it to solve the problem. At least, until I manage to develop it. However, it is not the only option being considered. Mark Gurman has also said that Tim Cook has maintained contact with OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT, DALL-E and Sora whose technology is integrated into Microsoft Copilot.\n\nWe will see what happens, although it is undoubtedly an interesting movement.

Fearing something that unlikely is ludicrous. Lol. Look guy, if its too controversial to be handled at the federal level then it should be handled at more local levels, ie the states. This is what the 10th amendment is for, let it do its job.\n\nFor the record i think abortion should be legal with restrictions. Its an immoral form of birth control and shouldn't be used as such. Otherwise it should be perfectly legal for medical reasons or in situations where a woman was impregnated due to non consensual sex. If the sex was consensual, and neither the woman nor the man took precautions to prevent unwanted pregnancy, any action past a plan b pill within the first 2 weeks should be prohibited. I think this because once a life is created, it is immoral to end it without justification. Simply not wanting a child while having explored no other avenue of birth control is not enough justification. Im not particularly religious, but i do like to think we have something akin to a soul or spirit.",

It will only work within 48-72 hours after conception.\n\nMaybe you should take a sex ed course if you don't understand the difference between plan b and birth control..or just google it.

You can still get pregnant even if you are \"a responsible adult.\"\n\n2) Women get raped. Or, worse, little girls get raped. Hard for those people to be \"a responsible adult\", especially when some of them aren't even adults in the first place.\n\n3) Not all abortions are for unwanted pregnancies. Not every pregnancy is because the woman didn't want it. Sometimes they want nothing more, but nature doesn't play fair. Why should a woman be forced to give birth to a baby that has no brain, for example? It will not live once born, but because of \"heartbeat\" laws, women are forced to carry them to term. Or ectopic pregnancies. There are countless scenarios where there is no chance the baby will survive but women are being forced to carry them anyway.\n\nAttitudes like this really get to the point that too many people against abortion believe. That people who seek abortions are bad people and pregnancy is their punishment for being bad. It's one step removed from \"if you weren't such a slut you wouldn't be pregnant in the first place.\"",

Abortion is a medication procedure that is used to assist women in wanted pregnancies who are experiencing complications and miscarriage.\n\nWhen you spent time in Emergency waiting rooms and L&D units you see more of it. It’s terrifying trying to plan for pregnancy in Texas. What if I get sick? What if there is an infection in my uterus but still cardiac activity for the baby… I lose both my baby and my life?

They mention Tik Tok once and it really is absolutely nothing relevant to the bill at all.\n\nDid you just do a Ctrl+F for Tik Tok on any committee hearing and then post a bunch of bullshit?\n\nThere is an app, TikTok, question mark. Is it a deepfake maker? Five days ago, TechCrunch reported that ByteDance, the parent company of the popular video-sharing app TikTok, may have secretly built a deepfake maker. Although there is no indication that TikTok intends to actually introduce this feature, the prospect of deepfake technology being made available on such a massive scale and on a platform that is so popular with kids raises a number of troubling questions. So my question to you, Mr. Harris, is in your testimony you discuss at length the multitude of ways that children are harmed by new technology. Can you talk about why this news may be concerning? Mr. Harris. Yes. Thank you for the question. So deepfakes is a really complex issue. I think if you look at how other governments are responding to this--I don't mean to look at China for legal guidance, but they see this as so threatening to their society, the fabric of truth and trust in their society, that if you post a deepfake without labeling it clearly as a deepfake, you can actually go to jail.\n\nThis is proof so indisputable that we have to ban Tik Tok? You're kidding right?",

When those executives asked their bosses in China, they found that TikTok’s algorithm team had tweaked certain aspects of the type of content shown on the app to play down political conversations about the election, and this had inadvertently buried the videos of a range of users, the people said.”\n\nThat is the reality of 2020.\n\nNow, in 2023. ByteDance try to propose this offer.\n\n“In the new proposed arrangement, according to the people familiar with it, third-party monitors would check the code for the video-recommendation algorithms to detect whether it has been manipulated or if the Chinese government or other foreign actors have had access. Provisions in the proposal stipulate that if the US government or the third-party monitors see anything that concerns them, there would be a process to flag the issues to TikTok, and ultimately to the US government if necessary.”\n\n“This could be a concerning development, as it would effectively enable US officials to also have some input into TikTok’s algorithmic process, and to potentially influence what the app shows, or doesn’t show users, based on their assessment.”\n\n“Which seems very similar to how the CCP dictates how Chinese-based companies operate their algorithmic systems - and it’s interesting, within this broader proposal, to consider how much, exactly, the CCP already influences in-app trends, and how that could relate to the same proposal in the US.”\n\nThere is a way to manipulate the algorithm, it has been done before. ByteDance in Beijing can access the algorithm and TikTok admit as such and within this proposal they show exactly how they do it and offer that control to the US government or 3rd party.\n\nSo this idea that the US wants force the sale to a US company to manipulate TikTok doesn’t hold water when that is exactly what TikTok offered the US government in project Texas.",

They don't want the US to see it.\n\nThis is going to get fast tracked through, I am curious what the reaction will be, gen z knows this is what's going on and they are flipping out about it, I'll be curious to see what alternatives or solutions to come out of it. But it is a sad day where for the first time Chinese style fascism and censorship is being applied to our first amendment, and we are being blocked from the number one social media site in the world for the young generations, to stop ours from seeing war crimes with weapons that we are paying for with our taxes.\n\nIt also won't work, I'm not even on TikTok and Iv seen more footage of the genocide and mutilated babies in the first 40 days then I saw in 35 years combined, on twitter. So we aren't at full censorship yet, but I do think Twitter might be the only website left where you could watch these videos unrestricted, which is terrifying.

                    "comment": "I’m calling out him criticising one group of “keyboard warriors” while having almost zero relevant experience himself, yea.\n\nI do marketing and do a lot of data shit. I have worked extensively on the backend of every social media platform for over a decade handling millions of users’ customer data and installing pixels on people’s websites. Hell, I’ve literally met with and had meetings with Bytedance staff and have colleagues that have worked at TikTok.\n\nYet I’m not professing myself an expert on national security or the inner workings of the platform here because I’m not. One thing I do know is that, of the few really good developers I know, they tend to not want to comment much on other people’s code without being able to see it.\n\nIn the end, there are a handful of people with actual expertise on what makes a national cybersecurity threat and more than likely zero of them will actually be commenting on this thread. We are all laymen expressing our opinions here so it’s stupid to try to artificially lift yourself above the masses by virtue of something as flimsy as being a software engineer in the technology subreddit.\n\nSo if you really want it, in my layman’s opinion, even in the worst case, I don’t see the big fucking deal about China having some control over Bytedance. The evidence that they have any sort of meaningful control over anything besides visibility into user data is flimsy at best. If it were that significant, it would’ve gotten banned during the last few regulatory scares. If anything it’s gotten better because they’ve been under heavy scrutiny.\n\nDespite what people have said here, Meta actually has also gotten better at restricting data visibility to outside entities. But they haven’t gotten that much better to the point it would stop the core controversy behind Cambridge Analytica happening again in some way. And do you know why? For one, one of the most public figures who abused that data (Ted Cruz) is literally still sitting in the Senate unpunished for it and another has a decent shot at returning to the presidency so your and my data privacy really isn’t that big of a concern to people drafting these laws.\n\nBut the main reason is that what makes Meta valuable is its ability to market things to users better than traditional forms of advertising so no matter what restrictions they put in they can never put in too many to eliminate the possibility for abuse because doing that makes the platform less effective (like the iOS 14.5 update) and loses them a fuckton of money. It is a fundamental issue with digital advertising that will never be solved without tight data privacy legislation against it.\n\nSo yea, ban national security important people from having it like they do now. That’s fair. But unless we actually are about to go to war with China, what is so exceptionally valuable for China to have here that they cannot get via other means or American social media platforms? How are they gonna fuck up our elections any worse than the thousands of sock puppet accounts that people unknowingly speak to every day on every social platform (including this one) or special interest lobbies that have direct lines to our government officials?\n\nMost of all, why do this shit during an election year where you’re looking at a tight race where you need high turnout to win it. Why rush through a ban on a platform overwhelmingly popular with young people who would vote for you in an election year?\n\nA bill like this is the equivalent to when they restrict people from showering too much during droughts. But here it’s a solve that not only papers over the problem but also pisses off a bunch of young people during an election year and strains relations with the largest superpower in the world outside of America. The young people thing is growing beyond just being upset about the banning of their favourite platform and has them thinking they’re being censored for having pro-Palestine views (a viewpoint being shared by young people on many platforms that aren’t TikTok) and is absolutely going to lose Biden votes. Forcing a sale like this also creates a terrible precedent for what can be done with any foreign-owned business that grows too big or successful.\n\nI know it’s popular to be scared of China but I see no value in it. They’re a nation of 1 billion plus people whose country does just as much shady shit as America but in a different flavour. To the rest of the world, China & America are just 2 big fucking overly sensitive bullies with different ethnicities. We need to learn to live with each other because they’re not going to go away. The alternative is that the 2 largest nations in the world going to war which can be nothing but devastating for humans in the world.\n\nRight now, China and America would never go to war because rich people in both nations would lose so much fucking money but if we keep slowly eroding economic ties until nothing remains for fucking meaningless political wins, we’ll be in a truly scary place.\n\nAnyways, that’s my full fucking opinion on the issue. I don’t care if anybody agrees or not but you asked. Enjoy",

                        "comment": "Thanks, ends up much better to see where you’re coming from overall. Much as you detest false experts, I immensely hate when people use seemingly fluff dress downs similar to your first comment. It came across as a dismissal to a fairly reasonable concern a regular person would have and those types of disconnects between white collar/blue collar are an issue. Many different backgrounds of people browse these forums, especially when big names are dropped.\n\nIs this issue on TikTok shortsighted in my opinion? Yes. It just changes who is trying to be directly in charge of the media. But just dismissing it without context on why you think what you do is fairly insulting in my opinion because there are people that don’t work on computers all day that also look at this as well.\n\nHonestly, there is a lot based in xenophobia and general distrust in the public with regard to the Chinese government. The reach the app has is what a lot of people fear in congruence with that sentiment. If it has this reach, could they abuse it and how becomes the question. Anywhere there is a Magic black box, there’s going to be more skepticism from the masses when it’s pointed at. Plus let’s be frank with technology listening more to us; people get a little freaked out so having Chinese Reach messes with insecurities. Not enough to actually not have the neat assistances from the internet of things or phones, but still it hits alot of paranoia.\n\nThe same regulator point (Ted Cruz abuse) is also why Americans could see this type of legislation becoming paralyzed by members that are either uncertain or abusive of the info in prior hearings.\n\nIn my opinion, the political reasoning the Democrats are doing it now is pretty straightforward if you watched the state of the union address. It points at the Republicans standoff to do as little as possible this year. One of Biden’s main quips at the Republicans was how they even shot down a bipartisan bill that they helped design for border reinforcement in their spite everything nothing gets through tantrum. This is something the Republicans wanted, probably due to US corporate lobbying/trigger their bases China bad tendencies to some extent. The Dems also have some of the lobbyists in their ear too, but I don’t want to go further in the lobbying cesspool.\n\nThe base, in my opinion, that you’d have to worry about swinging over TikTok moreso about would be somewhere in the 18-23 range, which votes less often traditionally. Older than those ages, and it’s not much of a knee-jerk reaction cause there are replacements and the older tech savvy group has already seen an app like this fail and get replaced (Vine) and is somewhat more indifferent as there are replacements. That vs. running ads about the Republicans refusing to work across party lines even when appeased to try to grab independents/undecided is the main play. If Republicans do work with them, it’s bipartisan and they blinked first. Which no kid, and I believe politicians are sometimes just little brats, wants to do.\n\nIt’s tricky to evaluate what decoupling aspects of our economies would do as America and China are very integrated and also have some strong tensions. I do hope we don’t end up in conflict, however the world is moving in strange ways. I imagine if a few mores moves are made and the US and their allies seem too thin then an opportunity will call that shouldn’t be answered.\n\nI realize this is mainly a rage response post moment that got you to respond, but thanks for sharing. I do enjoy hearing other views, whether I agree or disagree.",

You either came to the table with some sort of year over year reductions or your entire work statement was likely to go to market. And for a time there was always someone willing to “buy” work to get their foot in the door. High rate commercial work was extremely desirable from a backlog and absorption standpoint. The tables have turned completely now and it is a struggle to get a supplier to go all in on MAX work in particular because of the inherent risk in rate. 2019 it was a free for all to go and get as much MAX content as possible and build at 58 aircraft a month.

                    "comment": "There is a lot more to the story than that. Boeing needed more fuel efficient engines on the 737 to compete with the Airbus A320 Neo lineup which had brand new engines with class leading efficiency. So Boeing decided to strap those new engines onto the 737 (originally designed in the 1960's) instead of spending billions on a completely new jetliner. The problem is that the 737 is too low to the ground and couldn't fit the engines under the wings, so Boeing had to move the engines farther forward in front of the wings. This major design change came with some technical issues:\n\nBecause the CFM International LEAP engine used on the 737 MAX was larger and mounted further forward from the wing and higher off the ground than on previous generations of the 737, Boeing discovered that the aircraft had a tendency to push the nose up when operating in a specific portion of the flight envelope.\n\nPlacing the engines further forward causes the MAX to pitch up its nose and stall in certain conditions due to this design. Boeing created the MCAS software that would automatically pitch the nose down in these situations to keep the plane flying safely. Then Boeing removed adequate sensor redundancy for the MCAS system and made it a paid extra option. Meaning that if the one sensor failed, the MCAS would continue to pitch the nose down erroneously and crash the aircraft (Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302).\n\nIf that wasn't egregious enough already, Boeing did not inform pilots that MCAS even existed. It wasn't in the manual other than in the glossary. Boeing did not want to explain all of this to airlines or regulators so they could avoid the max being considered a new design and forcing extensive recertification and pilot re-training. This was simply a cost cutting and marketing measure to attract orders. How did the regulators not catch these extensive changes? How did this significantly modified aircraft pass certification?\n\nBoeing had successfully lobbied the government to transfer some certification powers in house instead of by the FAA. They told no one how significant the design modifications were to avoid costly testing and kept the danger of the design a complete secret from everyone. This is a major part of the problem. Boeing has shown it cannot be trusted and should not be allowed to police themselves. The 737 Max can stall under certain parameters but can be flown safely with adequate pilot training and sensor redundancy.",

It's that that's okay when you do it a few times. But when you do it too many, you end up with too many unusual workarounds for it. And you've optimized out the extra design margin in previous iterations, so you don't have margin to deal with the cascading changes.\n\nSo you either have to justify even less design margin, or find alternative ways to regain that design margin back.",

This meant that most people boarded a plane by walking up stairs so Boeing designed the plane to be low to the ground for less stress on the passenger.\n\nSo when it came time to design the Max they needed to put bigger engines on the wings. However, they didn't have to space for a normal placement so they're mounted higher up and further forward than usual which they tried to compensate with software.\n\nHere it is compared to an Airbus NEO, if you want to see.",

It is made of plastic for better noise characteristics and weight.\n\nHowever the area at the front of the engine can have icing problems due to the reduced air pressures (reducing the freezing point) as the air flows over them. So ice can build up.\n\nBecause of this there are deicers (heaters) to heat these areas. The pilot switches these on to prevent the icing.\n\nOther planes have the same engines and the same possible issue. So here is where it gets really tricky and 737 specific. On other planes they make the controls automatic. If you turn on the deicers then it heats up until the area is at a certain temperature that prevents ice from forming.\n\nBut on the 737 the plane has to use the same controls that the 1969 model had in order to retain its type rating (not require pilot retraining). And it didn't have automatic controls. So on a 737 when you turn on the deicers they come on and stay on. So maybe you turn them on and then it gets warmer (you fly toward the equator maybe). Now the deicers are on and it's not that cold so the cowlings get hotter than they would in any other conditions. And the plastic can embrittle and parts start to break off. If those parts go into the engine it could be a big issue. It could destroy the engine, even cause the fans inside to escape the engine and directly injure people.\n\nThe real, reasonable fix would be for the FAA to say \"know what, we don't care about the deicing controls when it comes to the type rating, just put an automatic mode on this and we'll call it done\". But it does not appear that is going to happen.\n\nAs far as I know the 737 has a similar issue for the windshield heaters. They can be left on and overheat and crack the windshields. So 737s suffer from cracked windshields a lot more often than other planes.",

Wouldn't the obvious solution be to say \"this cannot be safely operated the same way, so it needs a new type rating - congrats Boeing, now you can also fix the two decades of other life-threatening bullshit you had to do just to keep the type rating\"\n\nEdit: Now that I think about it... maybe the real lesson from this should be \"type ratings should have a maximum range of years they can cover\". Want to keep selling the same plane for more than 30 years? You can, but the 2041 model and the 2010 model can't have the same type rating. Even if they actually are 100% the same, need to make a new type rating, purely to take away the perverse incentives, because we now know that these lead to manufacturers killing people out of greed.",

They have all been checked, and have returned to service.\n\nMCAS is also not an issue anymore, since the pilots know about it, and the system has been redesigned to correct the issues that were present in its first iteration.\n\nThe engine anti-ice system is a problem, but not one that’s immediately dangerous. If the pilots leave the anti-ice system on for too long in certain conditions, the composite material that makes up the leading edge of the engine cowling could encounter some structural issues. In that case, it’s possible that parts of the cowling could be ingested by the engine, and cause an engine failure.\n\nSeemingly all of the other “Boeing” issues lately (wheel falling off the 777, the 737 landing gear collapsing after it slid off the runway, the 747 engine fire, the 787 that had a sudden dive) were either due to maintenance issues by their operators, or pilot error.\n\nThe main issues, in my opinion, are organizational within Boeing. The company culture is currently more focused on stock value than it should be, which has come at the expense of the engineering-forward approach that made Boeing’s reputation.\n\nThe media is running wild with the Boeing stuff right now since it’s getting lots of clicks, but the reality is that most journalists and most readers have no idea about the technical side of the airline industry, so lots of stories are being framed incorrectly.\n\nIt should be noted that there are known issues on lots of planes that are still perfectly safe to fly. On the Airbus A350 that crashed in Japan early this year, the intercom system didn’t work so there was no public address from the cabin crew to the passengers. That’s an issue, and I’m sure it’s being looked into. It doesn’t mean that the A350 is unsafe to fly either.\n\nThere are other issues that other planes have, but they don’t get reported on because they’re not dangerous, and because they’re too technical for a disinterested public to want to understand.",

America's rails should be electrified, but we lost all that knowledge and the factories that built it were dismantled forty years ago. California is rebuilding this capacity with the state HSR program, but that is still ten years away at least. Meanwhile, the freight railroads are adopting H2 cells and it appears it will supplement diesel in the same way diesel once supplemented steam, before completely eliminating diesel. California's CARB is subsidizing this transition, both in the private industry and public transit work, the latter of which the article talks about.\n\nAnyway, what it means for the rest of the US: by 2035, H2 cells will be standardized commodities and mass produced. All major railroads will be using them to some extent. Many trucks and construction vehicles will also be H2 powered. We might even have H2 powered boats, if CARB's other industrial development programs bear fruit. Which means: 15 years from now, diesel techs will be under the same pressure steam engineers were in the 1950s.

A monopolistic situation exists for medium-duty power systems which are what electrified trains are. This problem also applies to heavy rail bridge construction and tunnel construction, which is why American train tunneling costs now exceed $2 billion per mile. This is a known problem that the state HSR authority, Caltrans, and CARB are attempting to resolve with more non-college state subsidized technical training facilities, most of which are in the Central Valley.\n\nI'll qualify my argument by saying that this problem is especially acute in deindustrialized areas such as Silicon Valley, since Colorado is a great counterexample to this. It's why Colorado has the DOT's big train testing facility in Pueblo and why plans for front range rail service keep advancing (and will, eventually, include New Mexico which is also a counterexample wrt California vis-a-vis nuclear energy). In general this is how Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas manage to have a competitive economy vs California. It's also where all of California's jobs will go unless the above labor/knowledge problem is addressed. Ditto for Illinois and New York, both of whom maintained their electric railroads and thus kept all the knowledge and contractors that build it.\n\nNow say you're a massive, nationwide railroad with over 30,000+ miles of operative track and over 100,000+ miles of non-op track. All your operations are (more or less) held hostage by diesel shops where unionized diesel mechanics have to rebuild all 10,000+ locomotive engines every year.

Especially for UP in particular, they are a profit-driven business based on increasing quarterly revenues even if carloads drop. Their biggest customers are coal, oil and gas companies as UP also happens to own most of the gas pipelines within California. This one company can command the energy use of 50,000,000+ people without meaningful oversight, supervision, or regulation whereas DB and the German government cannot.\n\nWhich, in simple terms means: UP can get a really, really good deal on Hydrogen gas products. They already move most of the H2 anyway, and most of the intermediate products that are used to create the final H2 fuel. They can order up 50,000+ H2 tank cars as soon as their friends in Washington write rules permitting them to do so. This is not an option the German government has, they get all their gas from Russia and Russia owns the pipelines. Russia used to own half the trains too, which has created an infrastructure situation across Eastern Europe that doesn't exist within the US. Russia is also actively attacking some of this infrastructure and threatens to explode it every time another munitions depot is destroyed.\n\nA company like UP has no reason to become entirely beholden to a Chinese or Mexican Lithium company, especially when the latter is already moving to nationalize much of their business to re-socialize their railroads again. It doesn't help that many UP investors were also invested in Mexican lithium mines that were recently nationalized, so they don't want to buy lithium they view as stolen from themselves personally. Germany doesn't have this situation because they aren't communist anymore, don't want to be communist again, and trust their Russian business partners.",

And the fossil fuel companies need to make a profit. Telling their shareholders their profits went down because they gave discounts for H2 isn't going to fly. On top of that with trucks going electric, their cost per mile will go down. Meanwhile rail cost per mile would go up if they opt for H2\n\nTrucks may even reduce cost per mile more if they use self driving. While I think true self driving vehicles are a long way away until V2V and V2I gets standardized at the minimum. The equation changes if you have 1 truck with a driver in front and 1 truck with driver in back with 2 or 3 trucks being self driven in the middle. On follow and drivers watching makes it far safer and realistic proposition as the cars following don't even need AI to think, it just has to repeat the same exact thing the truck in front did\n\nThe thing about stuff like lithium is that unlike fuel you aren't burning it. So dependence is much harder as that battery is going to last you 15+ years. On top of that IRA laws is increasing production locally like Salton Sea in US and local recycling",

I never said they can't make specific wording or that mortgages and loans on stocks are exactly the same.  \n\n I'm saying once the door is open, it's easy to modify to impact more people. There's history of that here in America, the best example of that is the tax act of 1942. It increased the number of tax payers from 13 Million to 50 Million.  \n\n Final food for thought, why does the government need more money? \n\nSpending has exceeded the budget by over 400 Billion to 3 Trillion since 2005 and yet new programs and aid has come out in that time. The government doesn't have a revenue problem, it has a spending problem.  \n\nIf they aren't going to enact policy to reduce the taxes on middle class/poor than taxing the rich is just an empty talking point that works because it feels like injustice. \n\nLet's not forget that Congress members make $174,000 or more a year before bribes... I mean \"campaign funding\".",

Not impossible because governments and such spend lots of resources on tracking such things but it would take much more effort.\n\nWith something like an AirTag, law enforcement would just have to get a warrant and present it to Apple. Although Apple does have end-to-end encryption on a lot of things they are still required, by law, to keep records of account holders and provide that information through the proper government channels.\n\nOf course, someone can try making an Apple account with false information but that's a lot harder than you might think. Anyways, it's probably a lot tougher to do than buying a cheap GPS tracker and a throwaway SIM. Especially since AirTags are so easy to locate with all the protections on them.",

If lawsuits need to start somewhere, starting with Apple is a good place to start.\n\nWhile iOS warns users, depending on what scale you want to examine the market at (local to global), between ~50% and 70% of smart phone users aren't on iOS and receive no warning.\n\nTech companies love to create new tech, add minimal controls, and then wash themselves of solvable problems, such as this. If they want to ship the technology, they need to be willing to invest in all aspects of it. And their accountability is something that we shouldn't just easily wash away with short-sighted excuses such as \"There are better tools to stalk someone\". That approach continues the erosion of trust, safety, and security that individuals shouldn't have to worry about being taken from them.\n\nYes, there are a lots of ways to stalk someone and some are surely either as easy or perhaps easier, but that doesn't mean we should just throw our hands up. If that's the case, then one could argue we shouldn't regulate anything at all once an \"easier\" version of doing anything has been established.",

And because she had an android, there was no way to know it was in her car. There are precautions Apple could take to make them safer. And a reminder that attacks on plaintiffs has become a more common tactic in the last 20 years that benefits the company’s being sued. The claim of “frivolous lawsuits” benefits the party being sued significantly. This suit does not seem frivolous at all to me. These are not insignificant edge cases.

You can easily find a guy to paint you a picture that, to almost anyone, would look exactly like a Van Gogh.

It feels like he's injecting the trials and struggles he's faced and his sense of stubborn hope into his singing. At least that's my takeaway. Also, good suggestion because Elvis has a unique vocal quality that's a perfect song to use in this discussion, and it's just a damn good song.\n\nMy argument is that those emotional stimuli wouldn't be lost if an AI generated the song in this exact same form because the knowledge of the individual behind it has no bearing on your emotional response it's designed to trigger. Those feelings of hope and adversity are prompted by the strain in his voice and the hard projection of his words with a rising backing track and the sharp emphasis of the brass. We're basically hard-wired to respond with empathy or at least to feel a resonance with those emotions when we encounter them because we're heavily social creatures. But that doesn't mean that a human being is a necessity to prompt those emotions because they're just a response to environmental stimuli.\n\nNow obviously if you have a pre-established understanding of an artist it can absolutely color your emotional response to a work. I mean shit look at The Clash. They flat out lied about their backgrounds because it didn't fit punk, which directly influenced their reception and the processing of their music.\n\nMy core point is that a work can be just as emotionally evocative on its own with no creator connection because those stimuli are still present. Context might be missing but an artistic piece should be able to stand on its own merit without knowledge of the creator to truly have significant emotional value in my eyes, and AI art can do that even now in its infancy.\n\nSorry about being long-winded there, this is just a topic I enjoy talking about because of my own confusion as to why so many people have an issue with AI art as a medium.",

Here's why:\n\nReddit is old. It's not a hot thing and nobody is excited about it.\nReddit has never turned a profit. Some companies don't make a profit because they're reinvesting in the company for future growth. That being said.....\nWhere is growth for Reddit going to come from? Do you feel like Reddit's user base is going to skyrocket at some point? How many new users are actual human beings vs bots? Do you see any markets overseas where Reddit is going to take off? What new product could they roll out at this point?\nManagement of Reddit (the top level) regularly makes changes that really pisses off the product, whoops I mean \"users\". Ask Digg how that worked out for them.\n\nThe whole thing is a pass for me. I've seen a lot more ads recently and now they're doing stuff like this. They're trying to pump up Reddit so they can launch the IPO and the current owners can cash out. That's the only reason for the IPO. It's not going to be pretty for the site itself.",

That’s satellite, landline, and three cell plans, one with each carrier.\n\nThe federal grants from Covid are supposed to bring us fiber strung on electric poles. I’ll believe it when I get it.

I saw a lot of EVs in used car dealerships that couldn’t sell because suddenly new Teslas were cheaper than used ones. The dealerships or original owners are now in a tough spot, where the dealership might have to sell it at a loss, or the original owner might have to sell it for less than they owe on their loan.\n\nThis was also exacerbated by the prices being too high in 2021-2022. Owners overpaid for the cars and so when Tesla had large prices cuts in 2023 that meant the owners couldn’t sell their cars to break even on their loans. This situation affected ICE owners as well but ICE manufacturers weren’t cutting prices as far. Also because Tesla has 55% market share for EVs in the U.S., when they cut prices that far it hits the entire EV sector in the U.S.\n\nThese price drops are good for buyers, good for consumers, good for EV adoption rates, and only bad for people trying to sell their overpriced cars after just a couple of years.",

Tesla lies out of both sides of its mouth, consistently. Their latest hijinx with the CyberTruck should get an SEC investigation ongoing but teflon Musk gets away with murder.\n\nThat said, at least people have realistic expecations around Tesla performance now. Its still a reasonable use case for many (including yourself), but there's many many showstoppers to prevent accelerated adoption IMHO. in fact i wouldnt' be surprised to see a roll back in the coming years on EV sales...the only thing really driving them right now are fleet targets being enforced and tax grants.",

The whole point of buying it should be that you were willing to exchange that much money for it in the first place. If I buy a steak for $20 at the grocery store and cook it and eat it and go back to the store next week and they're selling that same cut for $10, I'm not gonna be upset that I paid twice as much for the steak because a week ago I was willing to pay $20 for a steak and that's what I did and that's what I got and that's a purchase that everyone involved can be happy with.\n\nThere is opportunity cost, yes, but it should not negate the point of making the purchase. If it takes away your motivation to go through with the sale, you don't want the thing enough to buy it in the first place.",

Most cannot get any rebate at all on a used one.\n\nSo the moment you drive it off the lot its value drops $7500 plus whatever amount other cars lose due to \"preference for new\".\n\nThen there is the improvement of new vehicles versus old. If I buy a new Accord it's really barely different than a ten year old one in capability. But if I buy an EV the new one is far better. Charges faster, goes further. etc.\n\nWhen the Tesla Model 3 came out it was overall, a better car than the Model S was. That means someone could get a new car for about $40K that car that was better than a Model S. So any used model S had to be sold for less than $40K. Even though it cost $80K-$90K new. Yeah, that's gonna hurt.\n\nIt's really not hard to see why this happens. And it mostly isn't inherent to EVs. It just market conditions due to how EVs are being sold right now and rapid advances in the vehicles.",

No oil changes, no spark plugs, no drive belts (at least for my bolt), no expensive emission equipment that is often targeted by thieves (I.e., catalytic converters).\n\nMoreover I’ve saved over 6500$ in fuel costs and maintenance over the past two years, when offset against my electricity charging costs. It’s a no fucking brainer to adopt ev if you want to save money over time. It makes no sense to buy ev’s as investment properties for resell as you do with other vehicles. Just buy it and drive it, and you will see over time how much money you save.\n\nIt’s all fearmongering.

I can certainly relate, although I will say the Teslas and Rivians of the world do a much, much better job of having a pleasant UI/UX experience (aside from Tesla's boneheaded decisions about hardware and removing stalks, half of steering wheels, etc).\n\nSitting in our Rivian now, and input responses are very snappy, it's easy to understand, software updates are on a regular monthly cadence. It does still have stalks for gear selection and wipers/lights, and things like heated seats, temp, and defrosts are all persistently fixed to the bottom row.\n\nI attribute a lot of this to having a mostly insourced custom builds of sensors, controls, and interfaces to work with. Legacy automakers still rely on a huge variety of suppliers for all of that, so building a software stack to seamlessly communicate with all of them (and most of them are running on 30yr old tech) is a nightmare. It's like trying to build a dynamic, mobile-friendly site exclusively in COBOL and AS400.",

They also had to further lower prices when it got announced new 3 and Y models were 1 year away. Nobody wants to buy an old version that is about to be replaced.

I thought, \"Wow, a Toyota for nearly a third of the list price. Such a deal.\" The deal was legit, and the car was very nice. However, it is hydrogen-powered, and part of the deal was $15,000 in hydrogen credits for fuel. I live in a metropolitan area of almost 10 million people, which has about a dozen hydrogen stations, and the closest was twenty miles away. That might have been manageable. Then, I happened to be talking with a friend who operates a body shop. He told me they had a year-old Murai in with a banged-up quarter panel. The damage was cosmetic, but the insurance estimate totaled the car. Repairs required the removal of the hydrogen tank and related parts, which pushed the bill into the stratosphere.\n\nThis was in the ad -\n\nAPR offer is available through Toyota Financial Services to well-qualified buyers with approved credit.

It has since been restricted to 186 mph peak speed with an average speed of 139 mph. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_maglev_train\n\nThere are test runs done at far faster speeds but because of dramatically higher operating cost and/or passenger discomfort trains generally operate far slower than the theoretical maximum speed.\n\nIf you contrast that with a plane that travels at 575 mph for the vast majority of the trip directly to the destination without any stops, minimal turns etc, it is apparent trains will never compete on speed and it is potentially a foolish thing to try to do.

They think of it that way because they never tugged on a rope attached to a ship. The ship is \"lighter\" in water but still cannot be moved (or stopped) quickly. A large enough ship can actually be moving so slowly that it'll crush itself into the dock even though if you look at it with the naked eye it doesn't appear to moving at all. Its momentum is very high due to its high mass despite it moving very slowly.\n\nPeople say things get lighter on the moon while their mass does not change.\n\nBut they do get lighter on the moon. If you put your couch on teflon feet in Earth it gets easier to move but doesn't get lighter. If you put your couch on the moon it does get lighter.\n\nIf you were on a very small world (or perhaps in Earth orbit, microgravity) the couch would be so light that you could lift it and move it (with effort). But you don't want anyone to throw it at you because then you have to resist all its momentum before it crushes you against the wall behind you because it's still massive.",

Overhead wires aren't going to give you that because you're not touching the rails for your earth, so are you going with a double catenary system like an old trolleybus used to have? Or are you going to fit a whole bunch of power coils in the track. Because nobody is building a diesel-powered maglev.\n\nSimply being able to levitate a vehicle above the tracks is only one small step. And if the rails are already there (which is the advantage this tech claims to have), then simply running regular fast trains is going to be far, far cheaper to implement and very close in rolling efficiency, rather than getting this thing working. Steel wheels on steel rail have extremely low resistance, and are exceptionally reliable.\n\nJust build a train, people. They work.",

Force exists towards whatever minimizes energy in the system. In the case where you put ferritic steel in place of the highest field intensity, there is lower energy, because magnetostatic field energy, E=int(1/2 B2/ magnetic permeability *dV), integrated over the space of the magnetic field. Basically, stick magnetic materials (like steel, with a high magnetic permeability) into the path of a magnetic field and the energy in the system goes down. Pull that magnetic material towards a lower field intensity and system energy goes up. So there is a restoring force akin to a virtual spring constant on the magnetic material (the rail) towards wherever the highest field intensity is. It’s still attraction, just attraction towards a free space field location, rather than attraction to a solid body.",
