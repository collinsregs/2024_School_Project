Dump files are crash logs from BSODs.\n\nIf you can get into Windows normally or through Safe Mode could you check C:\\Windows\\Minidump for any dump files? If you have any dump files, copy the folder to the desktop, zip the folder and upload it. If you don't have any zip software installed, right click on the folder and select Send to → Compressed (Zipped) folder.\n\nUpload to any easy to use file sharing site. Reddit keeps blacklisting file hosts so find something that works, currently catbox.moe or mediafire.com seems to be working.\n\nWe like to have multiple dump files to work with so if you only have one dump file, none or not a folder at all, upload the ones you have and then follow this guide to change the dump type to Small Memory Dump. The \"Overwrite dump file\" option will be grayed out since small memory dumps never overwrite.\n\nI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Even if they did do a proper line takeover(again.. on their own line...) they have the ability to easily retain the number at takeover when submitting the request. This can be done by all providers.\n\nIf for some reason someone screws up(changed numbers are almost always someone untrained and unaware placing the order trying to rush a number of ticket closes in a day because call center targets suck), they can very easily change the number on the line back to you.\n\nThere are some circumstances where if the original number belongs to another provider and they lose it it'll go back to the original company who owned it and not be in their pool to allocate, should this happen they can reach out to the provider owning the number and request as a gesture of goodwill could they let them keep use of it(this happens and is a very painless process)\n\nJust call the call center and explain what you need, and that you need to retain the number, they'll sort it, and if any issues come up, it's easily fixed, if the call center people told you Ofcom says you can't do that, escalate to their manager until you get someone who's trained and not just wasting their life away, it can absolutely be done and is a very normal process\n\nSource: Used to write training on number porting processes for a large ISP in the UK.",

It’s probably a problem with the game engine or driver.\n\nBack in the days I had a small lets call it “hack” solution, and I used a program that is called Ramdisk but it seems that it is not longer available.\n\nIt basically lets you to create a temporary system drive that is located in your ram and instead of your constantly read&write to your (back in the days HDD) SSD it will read&write to your ram.\n\nThe benefit of that is prolonging your SSD lifespan, but it requires you to have enough ram space to include the wanted data which in this case your game.\n\nNow Im not sure how those game work, if they constantly use your drive, but if this solution help then you will probably beat your friends loading time 🙃.\n\nYou can google Ramdisk, there are several solutions mostly paid.\n\nSaw ImDisk Toolkit which is free to use (not paid), look up in youtube for RamDisk videos, there are several videos for various programs Ramdisk programs with howto and what they do.\n\nI hope this will solve your situation for now because again your system is performing as expected and the problem is related to the game or its engine or system driver.",

Cause, games these days are massive, entire folders would absolutely not work for most of them.\n\nAlso, I've noticed one downside to this - you'll need to shut down and have a sync with your disk at shutdown to actually not lose all this data cause it's ram - so potential power outages or unexpected resets = lost save data for sure. But yea, do you have any experience with it, and what is a reasonable size for this disk when having 32 gigs of RAM?",

And check if it comes with Windows or whatever OS you prefer, some of them do, but some might leave you to set that up on your own.\n\nAlso, don't forget to check the ports and stuff to make sure you can plug in everything you need. But yeah, for browsing and docs, a mini PC should do the trick nicely!

Some sections you might want to look at include the installed battery, recent usage, and battery usage\n\nSome laptops (like some Acer models) have a pin hole switch at the bottom that let you disconnect or power cycle the battery.

I've never seen this wording used for getting access to files, so i can't really tell you for sure, but it just sounds like you need admin access, and just pressing yes gives it to you\n\nIs there a way to transfer her Windows User account/folder from the HDD to the SSD?\n\nYeah, you can just copy over the \"C:/Users/<her username/\" contents in the new ssd, but i wouldn't really recommend it since you'll get a lot of junk alongside of the files she actually wants\n\nSo essentially we want to use the SSD for OS and some games/apps that are better on SSD, and all the files, data and apps on the HDD we want to leave there and be able to easily access and run.\n\nYou'll have to reinstall all of the software you want to run on the hdd since your new windows install isn't aware that they exist, and where they exist, some software will still run if you find its executable, but some software relies on other dependencies so it might not start, or throw an error, or even start, but throw an error later while you're using the software.

TP-Link is a reputable brand. But be aware this may not work well, depending on quality of power cables/distance and seperation of circuits.\n\nAlternatively, try a mesh network solution. Good quality ones use a backhaul channel that's seperate from the WiFi itself, allowing for faster data speeds.\n\nIf it does come down to running a long ethernet cable, I would recommend Cat 6 at minimum - it's not much more expensive, but provides a greater guarantee of speeds and interference mitifation.",

Or, if your board supports 4 sticks, which as I recall that one may do, then buy RAM that is on the QVL list for the board at 4 sticks, and at the speed and capacity that you want to upgrade to.",

Also, make sure you are using the latest drivers, including the recent preview drivers, from AMD, not the ones from the motherboard manufacturer.\n\nIf you do think that you need to reinstall Windows, do an inplace upgrade first, so that you keep your files, apps and settings, rather than a full, new install. Only do the latter as a last resort. This thread also might be of use:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/15wcx43/smart_access_memory_is_the_same_thing_as_rebar/",

Bring up an elevated command prompt, run the command chkdsk /f. Let it run. That will pick up any disk issues most of the time. After that, again from an elevated command prompt, run the command sfc /scannow. When that completes, you can run a couple of DISM commands, which help with checking and fixing the Windows image on your system. For that, look up DISM commands order in google or wherever, and run the relevant commands. It only takes a few minutes usually.\n\nAs for above 4g decoding and resizable bar/SAM in the BIOS, unless they are enabled your card will not be running at it's full speed and capability. You'll be running with your card gimped in other words. They should be enabled by default, but that isn't always the case and should always be checked with a new build, or after a BIOS update.\n\nhttps://voltapc.sg/unlock-custom-pc-above-4g-decoding-is-the-best-setting/",

Neither of us made any change to our settings before or after the update.\n\nWe're not sure whether it's Fortnite itself or the new Nvidia driver (came out a couple of days after the fortnite update), but since you don't have an Nvidia card it might be Fortnite itself.\n\nKeep Task Manager in background to monitor any apps taking up your resources, but I think you're suffering from the same issue my friend and I are suffering from, along with at least another guy who posted on the fortnite sub.

It's remembered lots of mis-spelled words on my phone and is kinda irritating.\n\nIf they are using a mixture of non-english and English words, I imagine that could confuse things further.\n\n(Also, I use Samsung keyboard, but if I used Google, I imagine it would use my search history and YouTube watch history, too. And I know if you have a shared account on a smart TV or whatever, they can make \"surprising\" suggestions to the behaviour of other people using the account.\n\nAll that is to say, don't feel like the world is ending because of 1 small detail, but I guess there must be some subconscious or preexisting stuff hanging around for this type of event to be a big deal.

I'd triple check email accounts' (all email accounts) authenticator devices registered to your accounts, ensure emails passwords changed. Make sure that another person hasn't added their own 2fa method to your account essentially.\n\nIf you use a password manager, of course, change your master password, and verify/review known authenticator devices added to your account.\n\nThen think about every website, game, software, account you've ever logged into. Look at old emails, search \"sign-up\", \"verify\", \"account\" keywords into your email to find emails showing accounts you've signed up for, and change passwords there, if you really want to take it seriously.\n\nThere is a software by Nirsoft called webbrowserpassview, and chromepassview etc. and if you save passwords to your browser, this software can extract your passwords. If you booted your system with a portable windows and ran this software, you could locate your Chrome/browser appdata and find any saved passwords in your browser, and review what might have been stolen.\n\nIf your computer is infected, assume the malware ran this same software, to extract your saved passwords from your browsers. This trick does not even need admin permissions to run, which is why I recommend a password manager, and not saving browser passwords.",

Dump files are crash logs from BSODs.\n\nIf you can get into Windows normally or through Safe Mode could you check C:\\Windows\\Minidump for any dump files? If you have any dump files, copy the folder to the desktop, zip the folder and upload it. If you don't have any zip software installed, right click on the folder and select Send to → Compressed (Zipped) folder.\n\nUpload to any easy to use file sharing site. Reddit keeps blacklisting file hosts so find something that works, currently catbox.moe or mediafire.com seems to be working.\n\nWe like to have multiple dump files to work with so if you only have one dump file, none or not a folder at all, upload the ones you have and then follow this guide to change the dump type to Small Memory Dump. The \"Overwrite dump file\" option will be grayed out since small memory dumps never overwrite.\n\nI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Unfortunately any data overwritten is hard to restore but still may be possible to recreate.\n\nThis is not an job for an amateur or your regular pc repair shop. If the files really are important you need to send your drive to a data recovery specialty company which is not cheap but many offers free or really inexpensive quotes.\n\nWhile it may not help you now, in the future remember that all real important files needs to exist in triple; one on your computer, one on a local backup and one in a remote offsite backup.",

Reddit keeps blacklisting file hosts so find something that works, currently catbox.moe or mediafire.com seems to be working.\n\nWe like to have multiple dump files to work with so if you only have one dump file, none or not a folder at all, upload the ones you have and then follow this guide to change the dump type to Small Memory Dump.

This is fairly common to see because the developer might not want to commit resources to fully creating a service so they let svchost do most of the work and just focus on coding the stuff they need. This is usually done for smaller stuff, you wouldn't see a big company like Nvidia doing this. The problem is that if that's the case here, that the service it's hosting is causing the issue, we have no way of knowing which service is causing the issue.\n\nFive of them looked like that, the last one looked like memory corruption. With memory corruption it's usually pretty random which driver is blamed because it just lists the driver that had data corrupted. The only interesting thing here is that it was HP Omen Light Studio. Several of the common RGB tools are well known for causing memory corruption because of some bad dll file they all use so it's possible that's what happened there (I'm assuming it's a dll file they have in common because it's hard to imagine that so many RGB tools are that crap).\n\nI don't really have any good advice for what to do here. It's probably some program that has a service running causing the issue, but I have no idea how to determine which program that is. If I had to take a shot in the dark, I would uninstall all the stuff from HP. All software that was preinstalled or installed from HP's website.",

Beyond that and being able to see any DNS query if you are admin on the router, you cannot see specific traffic if the connection is HTTPS.

That is if you use an outdated browser and no SSL or encryption, but I should have made it more clear in my initial post. Your browser briefly does not know if you meant \"weird fetishsite.lan\" which is the name of 192.168.69.69 or \"weird fetish site .language french dildo\" or at least it didn't historically.

This is most likely where he is doing it, look at the bottom of the router for log in info and find your MAC address. I'm sure you can see your history on there.\n\nIf it doesn't there are other ways with little effort and router access, for example, this should allow you to use Wireshark to watch all router traffic. The wiki for wireshark talks more about options.\n\nHowever, I don't know you and your siblings. But I have two, I think your much better going from the mutual destruction / fuck you your being a dick approach and treating this as a relationship issue, not a tech support or I'll report you to feds issue.\n\nWith my siblings probably go like,\n\nHey, like, that's creepy. You know it's creepy right.\nCool, okay, so remember when you stole $200 from Mom and blamed Dad on losing it? Look, I don't wanna rat you out and I don't want you being a cunt. Hack something else asshole.\nLook up annoying bullshit things that upset them for two weeks as testing, if sibling rats you out on watching Panty and Stocking or searching worst gift for siblings birthday or reading erotic Hamlet fanfiction or something then you end up getting to go to parents like sibling is being a wierdo. Stick to things that are not going to get parents to kill you but are mildly annoying.\n( Lesser extent, phone and data only for things you wanna hide rn )\nLook part of siblings is discovering the horrors and you both going I am not going to comment.

The most sure fire way to stop this would be to reformat your computer with Windows Pro to enable Bitlocker with a strong passphrase to prevent him access to your operating system or its files. You would then want to use a full tunnel VPN to do your web browsing which would prevent him access to your internet traffic. The final step would be to make sure he doesn’t plug in random USB dongles into your computer when you use it.\n\nEdit: He could have either tracking or a remote monitoring and management (RMM) software installed on your PC. Reformatting would wipe this. Bitlocker would prevent him using this attack surface again. He could be tracking your DNS logs or doing MiTM depending on how much access he has had with your computer to configure this. Wiping the OS and connecting to a VPN would close out this attack. There are USB dongles that can track information by just being plugged in. Making sure nothing random is plugged in fixes this security hole.\n\nI have RMM installed on all of my managed computers and both DNS and traffic inspecting programs on my network… and I only play an IT professional on TV.",

It would be like just walking in to your room every 30 minutes without knocking. You or your parents need to talk to him about boundaries. Especially of he is going into cybersecurity where you have to learn how to do the bad stuff in order to do good stuff to counter it. Meaning he will learn in more and more detail how to do creepier and creepier things like having access to your webcam without you knowing. When I was a kid I found a little script that pulls all passwords saved in the browser back when it was just a txt file on the pc and I showed my dad using his computer. My dad isnt a super techy person but he was security forces in the airforce so when it printed a blank page he proudly said \"oh yeah I dont save passwords.\" The point of the story is what if he did save them? I as a teen with a not fully develeped frontal cortex could get access to so much. Bank accounts, email, porn accounts. I can find private things they dont want other people to know or do malicious things impersonating them. He needs to learn when to use his abilities for good, or white hat hacking, instead of bad, black hat hacking. Grey hat hacking would make the argument that if I think someone might have something illegal that hurts others on their pc then I will ignore their privacy to look and use as evidence against them later.\n\nAnd yes still counts as if it was as simple as leaving your browser open. Still a vulnerability that can exploited either maliciously (like blackmailing that they know what they watch on YT) or for good (telling the person they have a vulnerability and should make sure to close out on tabs so bad people cant access their accounts) or grey hat hacking (double check recent history and if nothing suspicious is there then move on)",

A much more likely scenario is probably something much simpler though, such as forgetting to log out, session hijacking via cookies or malware he's placed on your computer such as a RAT or keylogger. Definitely sign out of everywhere from a new device and change all your passwords to new passphrases and run a virus scan.\n\nYou should try hacking the hacker by implementing some social engineering techniques on him lol.. just appeal to his ego and tell him it's crazy cool how he was able to get into your stuff and ask him if he can show you how to do it.\n\nYou should get learning on tryhackme.com as there are many different attack vectors he could be using.

One think it does is it will start pre-fetching programs and data from your hard drive while the computer is idle, so that they can be loaded from super fast memory rather than the slow hard drive when you actually launch the program. If Windows gets it right, then the program launches super fast(or at least much faster than from loading from the disk) If Windows gets it wrong, it doesn't take any time to release the memory to make room for whatever it was you actually wanted to do.\n\nLeaving the memory unused is a waste.",

Other things than RAM can look like memory like the storage if the page file corrupts or the CPU if the memory controller is faulty. Zen 2 CPUs (3000 and 4000 series) also have a quirk where a faulty CPU looks like RAM.\n\nI noticed that the dump files show four sticks at 3200MT/s. The CPU is rated for 3200 and AMD never says anything about the amount of sticks (Until 7000 series), but some motherboard vendors have leaked that AMD's \"behind closed doors\" numbers show that it's often not stable and that 2666MT/s (That or 2933, can't quite remember) is the real supported speed with four sticks. Higher speeds can of course work fine, it's just overclocking technically. Kind of. It's pretty much a mix of the silicon lottery and if the CPU likes that kit which determines if it will work. So your CPU might just not like his RAM kit. Or it doesn't like that speed with four sticks with that kit.\n\nI know you have the same model number RAM, but RAM vendors don't make the RAM. They buy all the parts from other companies and just assemble it. Before each batch, they check which vendor has the cheapest chips that can do the speeds they want. Because of this, a later batch can be as different from a previous batch as any other random kit. All the important bits in RAM is made by Samsung, SK Hynix, Nanya or Spectec/Micron.\n\nThe \"His PC, my CPU\" set has two dumps that look like RAM, but the other three look like storage. As I said before, storage and RAM can look similar. This does have a storage feel though. If it's storage, it would be the drive with the page file on it.\n\nRunning Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_PageFileUsage -Property * in Powershell should tell you which drive has the page file.\n\nThere is some stretching here, it doesn't feel like a great solution, but it's what makes sense to me with the testing done here.",

I also know for a fact that 3000 series amd ryzen cpus, especially 3600 are well known for faulty memory channels on the die, so it might be both this on his cpu, and maybe even bad memory because of that in the meantime? Who knows.. i'll keep you updated when memtest is done. Btw i ran crystaldisk on mine and the health of all 3 drives is above 90%, and the temps are in the low to mid 30 (other than on the nvme ssd which is badly situated on the mainboard right above the backplate of the gpu so it sits at around 50°C).",

You should only do that if you know what you are doing.\nBecause of the above, your media needs to load an exFAT UEFI driver before it can do anything, however, the exFAT driver is not Secure Boot signed, therefore, if you try to boot your media on a Secure Boot enabled system you will get the Security Violationmessage you report (which is the reason why you should not change Rufus' defaults unless you know what you're doing).\n\nTwo solutions for you:\n\nRecreate the media in Rufus and don't change the default options. Then Rufus will use NTFS and not exFAT, and since the NTFS driver is Secure Boot signed, your media should boot on a Secure Boot enabled system.\nTemporarily disable Secure Boot, and reenable after Windows is installed.",
