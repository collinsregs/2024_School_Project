The hosts file should not be a text file, but rather a file with no extension. I would follow the path listed in the article, copy the hosts file found within to your desktop, and open it in a text editor. From there, paste in the generic data (or simply compare yours to the generic and delete any outliers) and save the extension-less file, then copy it back to the directory you found it in. (You cannot edit the file in-place, hence the need for the desktop copy to edit the file)\n\nIf your text editor asks for a file type, just say All Files and don't specify an extension.",

Some of these are also fake and just give single link DVI, others just don't work well. People have very mixed experiences with these.\n\nAnother option is simply replacing this old screen, it's already 8 years old, more modern screens look a lot nicer.",

Comcast detected unusual network traffic and traced it back to your router. Comcast can't see past its connection to your router (your router uses network address translation that somewhat obscures network traffic origins).\n\nIssue 1: It's possible that a single device on your network has been infected with botnet maleware and is generating the traffic.\n\nAction Item 1: Run virus scans on all your PC's and Mac's (yes Mac's can have maleware too). Start with the device youbuse for work. If you dont have paid antivirus, use Windows Defender. Run a Defender scan and then update Windows and then scan again (Windows update also updates Defender scan definitions). Phones and tablets don't usually host maleware like this unless you install apps from places other then the App or Play stores.\n\nIssue 2: It's also possible that someone hacked into your wifi and used your connection to generate the traffic.\n\nAction Item 2: If you're able to, try to log into the admin portal of your router and see if you can poke around and see a list of connected devices. Your router might have a section called DHCP leases. The leases last 7 days or so and act as a log of every device that has connected to your router in the last week. Review this lists to see if you have an unknown device.\n\nBotnet maleware doesn't usually spread by proximity. So if one device is infected, the others are not necessarily infected. Unless they both aquired the same infected file, separately.\n\nIf you use a corporate device, contact your IT department, explain what happened and ask if you need to have your device scanned. You most likely have a VPN, which will protect the customer data in transit. Even if you use a web portal to process customer data, it's safe as long as you're using https:// (the S is for secure encryption) and your website operaters set it up properly.\n\nYou might also contact Comcast and find out more details about the nature of the unusual traffic.\n\nHope this helps and good luck!",

That way you can use low a latency driver usually ASIO, so that there isn't a delay in between you playing and hearing/ recording what is played. You can get a small cheap thing that will work for about 25bucks, but I would recommend spending 60-100 and getting an inexpensive unit that sits on top of a desk. Something like; https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/UM2usb--behringer-u-phoria-um2-usb-audio-interface\n\nhttps://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/AudioBoxiOne--presonus-audiobox-ione-usb-audio-interface\n\nwhich I just picked randomly so now I'm not saying to get this specific piece of gear, as I have never used either. But I'm not going to recommend you spend a couple hundred, and really you can get amazing results from either of these units. My point is your better off getting something like this if it's something you're really interested in. A lot of them come bundled with various software programs from DAWs to guitar effects, where you are starting out you might want to look into that as well as the actual unit.",

Charge the laptop when it gets low at the 20% range.\n\nFor actual battery life span - maximize the charging level to 100%, keep the battery cool, Setup the laptop to its silent mode or manual mode and adjust power levels to minimums. If you have the ability to disable the dedicated GPU do so. Adjust keyboard lighting to minimums. Adjust laptop screen brightness to minimums. Turn off the Wifi and Bluetooth.

First couple times you use your laptop, discharge the whole battery, charge to 100 and then use normally. If you really want you could use the 80/20 rule. Charge to 80 an use to 20% left and then charge. Don't leave the battery in the charger past 80%. It's been a while since I've looked to see if this 80/20 thing does anything but I remember it being big back in the day.",

Either connection to the GPU (if the card needs extra power, besides the PCIe slot could be Power supply, or not good connected cable) or, assuming the card is still working, no good connection in the PCIe slot, or a Mainboard issuse.\n\nRemove the GPU from the slot and check that the slot itselt is clean and that the connectors on the GPU are looking ok.

Helldivers is getting 70fps sometimes dropping to 60, rarely lower and i'm at the same renedring settings. I messed with the graphics settings a bit too and the game runs smoothly at high settings.\n\nElden Ring also runs noticeably better, it dropped to 45 frames before now it drops to 50-55 at demanding places. Settings barely change anything, but i'd rather make it so i can reach this elusive 60fps. If nothing helps i'll just bite the bullet *shrug*\n\nAs for info from Open Hardware Monitor app, there are things i've observed myself, but there's going to be a screenshot link lower. What's weird is that when it comes to memory, it shows me that i have 24GBs available, is this normal when i have 32? I doubt it's what's causing my problems because my pc never used more than 15GBs during testing, but i think it's worth mentioning.\n\nNext, my CPU cores 6# and 8# often have more load than the rest, especially 6#. The temps topped at 81 degrees on CPU package and CPU CCD #1 whatever that means. Should i be concerned? I haven't observed temps higher than 75 degrees before. I have prebuilt water based cooler and my thermal paste on the CPU was put on when the PC was initially built, back in September 2023. As for clock speed i have no fucking idea, if i knew these things i wouldn't be there haha\n\nMy GPU used 6.4GBs MAX out of the 12GBs available and it's often at 100% usage in the task manager. I read on the internet that it's normal and it means my GPU is just working.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/nORZ4id - the screenshot, looks like my SSD the games are on is named as \"Generic Hard Disk\" hence it's the only one i'm showing. I recongized it because it's 85% full.\n\nAll in all, i don't know much about hardware, i built the PC with my friend who does PC builds as a hobby.\n\nI'll check rufus later as i'm getting ready to sleep for today.",

But again, per your point, if you've never used that much space, it's more of a luxury/housekeeping task.\n\nSounds good on Rufus. When you get to it, I would also see about running the games in 1080p and see if that changes the FPS somewhat, if at all.",

An old cell phone may never receive a software update however.\n\nopenssl which is very commonly used to encrypt network transmission data published a major version upgrade from v 1.x to v 3.x last year. widely used websites will often follow the secure computing trends and not support outdated ssl encryption.\n\nopenssl did this for valid reasons including several software security vulnerabilities in the 1.x versions that became end of life software versions.\n\nThat mentioned ssl protocols are not required for http web browser traffic but using unencrypted http for anything of great importance is not advisable.\n\nIf you've not try using firefox for mobile instead of whichever web browser your currently using.",

All 3 lights were in fact on, fault, AC and battery. It stayed that way even after the 10 second self test was completed. They stayed like that until I turned off and on the UPS.\n\nI'm starting to question if the battery self test actually failed and the UPS forced itself back into AC, and tried to tell me so. And the two times it randomly turned off was due to a voltage spike like you mentioned but the battery is dead. ViewPower says the battery is at 100% though so not sure.\n\nAssuming the battery is not dead, if I turn off the UPS and unplug it, would it use the battery when I turn it back on while not connecting it to mains?",

There's rarely a visibly noticeable difference using an image format's suggested image export defaults.\n\nThe youtube video thumbnail on my most recent youtube video was \"converted\" from a 1920x1080 png using Gimp.\n\nIf needed gimp can also crop images.",

Overheating can cause the controller on the drive to malfunction and reset - Windows doesn't expect the system drive to suddenly disappear.\nTry moving the drive to another m.2 slot if your motherboard has more than one.\n\nIf none of the above help then, most likely, the drive needs to be replaced.",

Dual channel will only work when you have exaclty the same ram sticks in slots 1-3 and 2-4! Dual channel will litterally double your memory bandwidth, and I think it will be very usefull, specially with DDR3!\n\nPS : better run with 8gb ram in dual channel than with 10gb ram in single channel! So, in your configuration, if you have 2 sticks of 4gb exaclty the same, use it like this and enable XMP settings in your bios!",

Before deleting check if those are not system or in any other way necessary files.\n\nReset/refresh will leave bunch of old data and windows files. If you wont to get rid of them all, use clean windows install - from usb drive with deleting all files.\n\nStorage expansion depends on model, some cheaper ones use emmc storage that can't be changed/expanded (soldered on motherboard). Post here the exact laptop model so we can check what can be done.\n\nCPU and GPU (sometimes even ram) is soldered on motherboard and can't be replaced, for upgrading to windows 11 you will either need completely new computer, or you can skip hardware requirements (Rufus can do that), but you will be limited with new windows \"versions\" - big updates that comes semiannually mostly, complete windows has to be reinstalled in that case.",

Maybe Snapchat (especially if the police are asking) would give all the private messages the account is doing, in case its doing it to other people too.\n\nIf someone is impersonating you, especially if it is personal and not a random scammer, it could be serious and thus police might be good to as self-defense from what the person might be attempting to do.\n\nEDIT: There is probably some position at your work you should also report this to, whether it's human resources or a manager or what, to make sure it is clear and documented, what is happening.\n\nEDIT 2: I read that you are new to the country and assume that means also new to the company, and also it would mean that whomever is doing this would somehow know where you are working and the colleague to text. So that kind of narrows things down and makes it clear that it may be personally targeted. Impersonation is fraud and is a criminal matter and thus the police are ones who can address it.\n\nAlso what did your manager say about it? Did they express appropriate concern and identify it as possibly a legal matter (either as impersonation, or as harassment)?\nEDIT 3: If you're new to a company, and someone makes it seem like you're inappropriately harassing a co-worker, there's probably a high chance that someone wants to make it very bad environment for you at the company. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's what it feels like to me. The manager may not be considerate to that, butt the police won't have any conflict-of-interest in the situation, and Snapchat may only provide records to the police, and those records are evidence that you may need to use to prove it isn't you (or find out who it is).",

I have her number saved so it’s strange that when she called, it said no caller ID (unless she used a different number).\n\nI think I’m going to consider reporting it to the police just to be safe. I will ask my colleague to see the messages again and take pictures of them for my record.\n\nYes, I don’t have a good feeling about this because why use my name for this? I even asked my coworkers if they are pranking me and they denied it.\n\nI told my manager it wasn’t my account but she didn’t really have a reaction and was very nonchalant about the whole thing.\n\nI am really unsettled and worried because I have a cordial and professional relationship with my colleagues and I don’t know what this could be about.\n\nIdk if this is relevant but a few months ago we had a new employee join (he quit within a week). He had asked this colleague out and she had declined. For some reason I feel like maybe it’s him?\n\nBut idk I feel so vulnerable because what even? I think a police report might be the way to go.

He just stopped showing up and then quit.\n\nMy mind keeps going to the colleague because she’s been telling anyone who will talk to her about this and it’s making me so uncomfortable (if it wasn’t clear, I am a guy and so this clearly makes it look like I am making inappropriate advances towards a colleague. And I’m not. I literally have a girlfriend of almost 5 years and even my coworkers know about my girlfriend).\n\nI do hope the colleague is not in danger but I also wish whatever this is, I wasn’t dragged into it.",

And also it might help things in that she can understand what might be going on, if it is him.\n\nBut if you get the photos first, you can go to the police on your own even if she doesn't want to. Of course you can go to them anyways if she refuses your request to document them, and just tell them the situation without that evidence, but hopefully she won't do that - but it is probably simpler to ask/get them first, before mentioning the other stuff.\n\nJust to mention, my first thought was that it might be a racial thing, if you are from another country and are a racialized person compared with whereever you are now, country and/or company. And if the week-long employee was too. But maybe that's just me projecting.",

And I did think also, along with just going to the police, there are community legal clinics in many places, that you can get advice from too - whether in advance of the police, or after the fact.\n\nIf it does start becoming a larger problem, or if you just want to learn more, look up 'workplace bullying.' Though I hope for your sake it doesn't progress.\n\nEDIT: I understand you not wanting to look like you're deflecting blame, but at the same time, you already said it wasn't you. You could simply ask if she thinks of anyone who'd be trying to get her address (or whatever else was in the msgs) who'd know of your connection to her.

This has absolutely no minerals, and thus, can not conduct electricity as long as it stays clean enough, though Isopropyl would be preferred unless there are some things on it that are only water soluble, such as sugar.\n\nLeave it to dry for at least 24h with Isopropyl and at least 48h with water rinse, if you do both, use the water rinse first as it will help you pull out any remaining water.\n\nDo not use paper towels to dry it, use a lint free antistatic cloth if you want to dry it, or carefully use some compressed air, you better hold that gas can dead level though or you might cause more damage.\n\nDo the same to your Motherboard, I can't imagine the MB to work fine, unless the GPU was mounted somewhere else in the case than directly in the slot, horizontally (e.g. not using a riser).\n\nJust for completeness, I do NOT recommend rinsing your PSU, if you somehow use conductive liquid, open it up, or in any way, shape, or form touch the capacitor contacts, this could electrocute you. DO NOT DO THIS. Get a new PSU if water got into it, or let an authorized repair shop fix it for you.\n\nWith all this being said, if you're lucky, it might work again.",

If that has occurred an excessive volume of invalid boot entries may cause a boot loop if booting an invalid entry had been attempted for reasons.\n\nefibootmgr can also be used to alter the configured boot order for example by typing\n\nefibootmgr -o 0002,0001,0000\n\nthat mentioned if you remove the Boot or microsoft directories from that efi system partition windows bootloader is unlikely to continue functioning until after having been repaired.\n\nthe EFI/Boot directory is the universal efi loader file directory where uefi boot checks for a specific file to load an os install boot entry without interactive configuration being required such as after moving an os install disk to a new or different pc.",

Which one should I set my antenna to reach?",

May vary but some pcs have a boot menu button or it might need to be selected from the uefi (bios) menu\n\nfollow the prompts, making sure you select the right drive (much Less risk of you unplugged your other drive). Make sure you select the right version of windows",

Select USB. Save and Exit.\n\nInsert the Windows Media Tool USB Flash drive into USB Port. Your PC should boot in Windows Installer Guide. Follow the steps and make sure to read carefully the instruction.\n\nAfter few steps, it will ask you where to install windows. Your available drives will be shown (nvme, ssd, etc.) and when you select a drive, Windows Installer CAN format that drive before installing Windows.\n\nContinue installing and after few minutes, it will boot a clean windows system.\n\nGoodluck and God Bless 🙏🏻",
