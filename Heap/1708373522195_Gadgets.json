I didn't like how big the screen was, though. I also really hated the physical audio slider, because I want my phone on vibrate 100% of the time, but it would accidentally slide when I would put the phone in my pocket, which really irritated me. The audio slider was actually the biggest deal breaker for me. If they let me remap it, I would seriously consider another OnePlus phone despite the screen being uncomfortably big.\n\nI also got hardware failure on both my OnePlus phones (2 and 6) in the past. The volume buttons on my 6 broke and we're always being pressed. And one speaker stopped working on my 6, so I had to be on speakerphone all the time.",

I'll never forgive Google for discontinuing the Nexus 7 line, those were basically perfect small tablets. The size was just right for reading and the fact that they were Google products meant you got bone-stock Android without all the crapware the other manufacturers add in. Plus the price was pretty good, as I recall.\n\nAnd yes, I know I can get a dedicated Kindle e-reader, but I want a device that can read books AND do other stuff, the e-ink kindle devices are just for reading that's it and you're also locked into Amazon and Kindle for book content.

There are just some features that can not be created using standard molding techniques but they are not necessarily related to geometrical complexity. A sphere inside another sphere can be 3D printed but not really molded with standard equipment even though it only consists of 2-3 primitive bodies. On the other hand, an object with very complex surface detail and overhangs can be easily molded.\n\nStill, I think there are many examples of molded geometries that most people would say are complex shapes if you asked them. Imho it's a bit of an unfair blanket statement to say that you can't mold complex shapes.",
