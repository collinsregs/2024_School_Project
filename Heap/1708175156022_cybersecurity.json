What you see is that a DNS client asked DNS server to resolve something, oh the horror. Same with AD (from allowed areas). Event intensity might be helpful for detecting lateral propagation and such, but you should have EDR for that which will do the job a million times better. No point in paying guaranteed fees (direct or indirect) for information that almost certainly will not provide any value and definitely will make it harder to find something that does.\n\nCutting the crap is the real art in cyber.

What you described sounds sufficient to me technically, just a bit different, it would stick out to me. There is nothing in the control that requires the internal audit to be conducted against ISO, so I think your okay, but it's going to probably trip up auditors going forward.\n\nThis is one of the interesting things about ISO, some of the guidance is very high level and open to interpretation, but pretty forgiving as well.

As well, when auditing CSF, you score it to an internally developed profile. Whereas, ISO or 800-53 or …, you do it scored to an externally developed profile or pass/fail or …. So the auditor may be saying that the profile scores for CSF that you have chosen as goals for your organization may be insufficient for ISO. Or they may be confused about the crosswalks/crossmappings you’ve chosen and built out. Or they may just honestly think you did a crap job of evidence gathering and haven’t gathered evidence with proper adequacy and sufficiency.\n\nComplianceforge sells crosswalked standards for a few thousand. If the issue is the crosswalks, grab one and show them. If the issue is the evidence, work with them then to get better quality evidence. But if the issue is the standard is totally inappropriate, you may have to redo things. I deal with this everyday, yell if you need a free consult",

Once I was able to do this, I was pretty consistent in working ~40 hours per week. Currently at a later stage startup, and I probably work between 35-45 hours per week.\n\nThe problem with working longer is that efficiency drops and people burn out, and good teams/managers realize this and don't push it unless necessary (like sales deals are on the line, or there's some critical customer-facing launch).\n\nOf course there are probably lots of terrible companies/people out there. You'll need to develop your skills so you can join the better places, and also learn how to spot the terrible places and avoid them.",

Because they actually don't use much of their brain so they don't feel the burnout. And if client demands change all of the sudden - then their job is to give that demands to the team. But the team does the hard work. So at the cost of others.\nSo it's similiar to every type of work, there are structures and there will be some people that do most of the nasty or hard work and some people who seem to do nothing at all. So if you find yourself an IT job that you will be able to not do much then you will find your work life balance.",

Just to stay relevant you have to learn constantly, career advancement requires more than that.\n\nBut at least you can grow and it is fully under your control, you don't have to study formally like doctors or lawyers and work culture is usually fair.\n\nIn my area there isn't shorage of people in tech and cyber who don't quite do that and just go with the flow.

While AI and automation will certainly transform many roles, I don't believe security professionals will become obsolete anytime soon. Here are a few key reasons why:\n\n— While tools like ChatGPT can generate code, it is often vulnerable or flawed. Not to mention how expensive it is to train these models.\n\n— New attack surfaces. As technology advances, new vulnerabilities and attack vectors open up that AI will not be prepared for. After all, AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on. Skilled humans will be needed to analyze and defend against new risks. And we’ve already seen what happened when AI tries to update itself: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/02/artificial-intelligence-self-learning/677484/\n\n— ML models can be attacked too, which makes oversight of security professionals even more crucial. Even the best AI needs human supervision, testing and oversight to ensure safety and prevent unintended consequences.\n\n— Creativity and innovation. Coming up with clever solutions to complex security problems requires out-of-the-box thinking AI cannot currently match. The human element fuels new ideas. Like how we came up with AI in the first place.\n\nSo while AI will certainly take on some menial tasks, the cybersecurity field will still require creative, strategic, ethical professionals. Specialists like security architects, analysts, engineers and researchers will continue playing irreplaceable roles. AI will be a tool, but not a wholesale replacement.",

Also, can't resist being a little bit passive-aggressive: anybody who thinks ai is good at programming is a shitty programmer.

Stupid use of functions, repetitive lines, etc. BUT I’ve used it instead of Google and it is pretty decent until you want up to date information.

Those who copy paste code like a monkey (and not understand any of it) are in trouble though, which is good for the industry overall in my opinion.\n\nAand just to stay on topic with the sub, Cybersecurity is always evolving, there are new threats literally every day. Don’t think that only the “good guys” will use AI. Bad actors will use it to find new ways to hack and breach into systems.\n\nPlus hacking (and defending from hacking) often NEEDS creativity, which AI doesn’t have. What we have is not really AI, it just has billions of data fed into it and it tries to predict the best answer based on the input and context. If you throw a completely new exploit at it or whatever, it will be probably pretty much clueless.",

There are several different ways to do this but the gist is the same: Have your most-senior IT executive sponsor an exercise with the company’s leadership team (CEO, CFO, CHRO, SVPs, etc) where they are interviewed about cyber risk concerns (Fraud, business disruption, IP theft, etc.) Translate those responses into cyber risk line items and report the aggregated results to the leadership team and the board. You’ll probably want to develop a list of projects and budget requirements as a precursor.\n\nOne of the best things about this approach is that the leadership team can’t dispute the list or priority and becomes somewhat compelled to fund them. “You said you were worried about this!”\n\nI’d suggest that for your first assessment, use an outside consultant to facilitate the exercise. From there you can run it yourself.",

This works for smaller firms that want to sign a contract and forget about it but larger firms want you to monitor their tools - how do you handle the way the alerts come in?\n\nThere is another 50 or so questions I could probably come up with.

Many schools have research labs or centers of study focused on specific aspects of cybersecurity or computer science too, where faculty work on various projects sponsored by other institutions, the government or corporations. My alma mater had partnerships with places like MITRE, NSA, DoD, etc.\n\nIf you've ever been to a cybersecurity convention that has talks, sometimes there'll be students from large research institutions that present proof of concept exploits or research findings done at their school's research center for security or comp sci, etc. This is partially why I'm a strong advocate for going to an in-person school if possible, cause you meet great people doing this kind of work that are in the industry. I've gotten recommendations and eventual job opportunities from professors through their connections in the field for stuff like internships. My school even requires getting either a research internship from a partner program or a co-op/internship in order to graduate too.",
