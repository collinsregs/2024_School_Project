If you have a liberal bias, they put more and more anti-conservative media in your feeds and in your ads. If you were on the right, you’re bombarded with fear mongering and sometimes subtle, sometimes not so subtle, misinformation or misleading information. If you are religious, you get more information on how your enemies are trying to take away your religion. If you are a heathen like me, you get all kinds of media about how you are going to be forced into religion.\n\nIn the end, the only winner is our adversary who has planned this campaign for years and all the US advances in technology have only proven to be the very tools used against our citizens. If the American people, as well as other democracies around the world do not start facing this truth with extreme prejudice, we will continue to watch the destruction of democracy.\n\nFor the United States For Ukraine For Democracy\n\nFuck Putin Fuck Russians that support him Have faith those that work against him",

I didn’t even think the voice was that good of a facsimile.\n\nIf I were to guess how this was done, he used an AI program like Kits and uploaded an edited audio file of Carlin’s standup to train the voice. The he recorded his own vocal “performance” of the material and used the trained voice to regurgitate it. If he’d used text to speech the results would have been too monotone and subdued to pass for a live performance. But that’s where much of the “it doesn’t sound like Carlin” comes in, it’s because his read does a poor job of mimicking Carlin, of guiding the AI voice and of delivering jokes.",

If AI cuts down 10% of the job responsibility of a call center agent (say, there are 100 FTE pre-AI), it will cut down the need of 10% of total call center headcount (now we only need 90 FTEs, so let's fire our 10 worst performers instead of helping them find a better fit within the company).\n\nIt is impacting a lot of roles across operations, sales, finance, quality assurance, HR, developers... you name it and AI will optimize business processes with less labor costs.",

If you are a big brand looking to activate with awareness campaigns, the order of priority is Google, Meta, TikTok, Pinterest, Snapchat, LinkedIn THEN Reddit. The only advertisers that see any kind of value are niche tech companies and finance platforms, and even that data is Fugazi.

Since they are both essentially data harvesting machines, this will be one of the most major contributors to the valuation. The other major factor is how much data they collect. Obviously we have no way of knowing for certain, but it’s fair to say with its more finite resources, Reddit probably doesn’t have the same mechanisms in place to collect quite as much data as Twitter or Meta for that matter.\n\nAll these factors and more combine to indicate that even with Twitter still being overpriced at an estimated $24 billion that putting Reddit at $5b is a joke.\n\nMark my words; They are just saying $5 billion for short term hype.

Something went wrong while displaying this webpage If you're seeing this frequently, try these suggestions. Reload\"   the suggestions were the obvious dumb corporate responses that weren't helpful and have done nothing to help the issues from continuing \n\n\"We encountered an error We were unable to load the content for this page. Go Home\". This one annoys me something fierce as it happens frequently and takes you back to where you started, seeing all the posts you just looked at. I just turn reddit off \n\nThere are so many more problems but I'd rather just shut reddit off now than continue to use this chatbox with has turned into a small like 7 line box that I can barely see what I've just typed. Also can't scroll up or down for some reason right now, so if something is screwed up or spelled wrong I just don't care. \n\nI have no options to message anyone about it or anyway to communicate that the issues are happening.",

We are upset because there was NEVER this amount of outrage when it happened to so many other women, including minors. Nobody gave a shit when deepfake porn of teen girls was circulating around high schools. But when America’s #1 Woman’s deepfake porn gets attention, now suddenly all these powerful parties want something done. Now we get a bunch of articles every day throughout the week about this topic, when nobody gave af these past few years when it was happening to other women . “better late than never” is a stupid excuse to ignore how they didn’t care when it affected commoners like you and me. You can’t say there was anywhere near this amount of outrage for deepfaked underage women. Definitely not from Microsoft, Twitter, or the White House. It’s simply not true.\n\nAnd we all know it’s mostly just virtue signaling so they can fulfill whatever self-interested agendas they have.

        "comment": "Michael Barnard\n\nAs we electrify everything everywhere all at once to deal with global warming, one of the questions that comes up is: “What about trucks?” And the answer is the same as for every other form of ground transportation: electricity via batteries and maybe with grid-ties.\n\nLet’s disambiguate a few things here as there’s a lot of nonsense thrown around about trucking, much of it from the trucking industry and a bunch of it from the rail industry it competes and interacts with.\n\nTrucks come in multiple sizes and operational characteristics. Most of them have fairly narrow geographical reaches and loads. Think Amazon delivery vans, garbage trucks and 18 wheelers that bring produce and other food products from suburban distribution centers to big grocery stores every day. None of these trucks anywhere in the world have any problems at all with running on batteries. Range and load just aren’t issues.\n\nAs a case in point, Pepsi is now running 21 Tesla Semis on regular routes of up to 450 miles to and from its Sacramento, California distribution center. They are carrying Frito Lay potato chips and full loads of soft drinks.\n\nIn September 2023 a large data gathering event occurred, the \"Run on Less\" event organized by the North American Council for Freight Efficiency (NACFE). The loads, routes and charging of 22 different electric semi trucks from multiple manufacturers being used by different organizations in different parts of the USA were captured and compared. While Tesla’s Semi and charging were head and shoulders above the rest, trucks from other vendors were easily doing 150 miles and up a day with real loads and routes.\n\nThere’s a lot of noise about Class 8 trucks and weight which even the empirical reality of Tesla hauling Pepsi hundreds of miles isn’t putting to bed. But weight of trucks and potential damage to roads are red herrings.\n\nCurrent battery electric semi tractors are heavier than fully fueled long-haul diesel tractors. Battery energy density today still requires a lot of batteries to achieve the ranges Tesla and other manufacturers are delivering. In the USA, Class 8 trucks are limited to a loaded vehicle weight of 80,000 pounds, about 36 metric tons. Most jurisdictions have permitted electric semis to be 2% to 3% heavier.\n\nWhen I discussed this with David Cebon, founder of the Centre for Sustainable Road Freight, roads expert and mechanical engineering professor at Cambridge earlier this year he made a few points worth repeating.\n\nClass 8 trucks are simply the lowest common denominator for freight trucks in North America. Every country and state allows them to operate, so they can freely cross borders. However, many US states such as Michigan already allow much heavier trucks on their roads, in that case over double the 80,000 pounds. Class 8 is a regulatory convenience, not a hard limit, and allowing electric Class 8 trucks to be slightly heavier is not an issue.\n\nThe decades-ago US study which found an exponential relationship between the weight on axles and road damage was deeply flawed. A two-year study on a closed loop had significant frost heave damage in the second year, this wasn’t accounted for and then the statistical study itself was further botched. Despite this, it became an accepted rule of civil engineering and an anti-EV meme.\n\nIt’s been thoroughly debunked, including by Cebon himself long before he turned to decarbonization of trucking. Much heavier trucks than fully loaded Class 8 electric trucks are already running on roads globally and if the road damage claims were true, all of those roads would be rubble in months.\n\nBut what about range? Clearly we already have a very large part of the trucking industry’s operational requirements met with current batteries. But trucks run a lot further than 450 miles in long-haul trucking. The longest range on a US diesel truck is around 2,100 miles when fully fueled, and the USA, as far as I can tell, relies far more on trucking for freight movement than most geographies.\n\nIs that within the range of battery electric energy densities? It certainly is. The world’s largest EV battery manufacturer, China’s CATL, started manufacturing and shipping a battery with twice the energy per unit of weight as the ones in Tesla’s trucks and cars this year. It’s initially focused on the electric aviation market, but will be selling it for road vehicles in 2024. The 450 miles becomes 900 miles on a single charge, and the over 1,000 miles one of the Semis traveled in a single day on its rounds potentially increases to 1,500 miles or more including time at very high speed chargers.\n\nThat’s with batteries commercially available right now. Four different organizations that I’m aware of in multiple countries have overcome the technical challenges and are commercializing silicon battery chemistries. The theoretical energy density maximum is five times that of CATL’s new batteries. Only doubling it is required to provide equivalent range as diesel semis viable with a lighter tractor and hence more load.\n\nMost analyses which dismiss batteries for trucking make assumptions that batteries are not still improving rapidly on metrics of price and energy density.\n\nBut still, that doesn’t solve the system problem. We need to get electricity into those new batteries. Different countries have different rules for drivers, with the USA allowing them to drive far longer with fewer rests than Europe. Europe’s rules provide lots of time for charging as do the USA’s with the new batteries and very high speed chargers.\n\nBut we have to get very high speed chargers into truck stops and get the electricity to the truck stops. In many parts of the world, this isn’t particularly onerous. In the long rural routes of the USA with its relatively weak grid, it’s a bit more challenging. Tesla solved this for its cars by building the world’s most reliable inter-city high-speed charging network, something it’s doing on four continents. Tesla is making its 1 MW power Megacharger the new standard in its network, so every Tesla Supercharger location will be able to charge Tesla Semis. Other vendors will catch up.\n\nEven before that, with a range with CATL batteries of 900 miles, a Tesla Semi would only have to charge up twice in the middle of the country to cross the entirety of the USA. It’s not onerous to build sufficient chargers initially for a small number of electric trucks and keep adding to them every year. It’s not like we have to electrify every truck stop tomorrow.\n\nThe power requirements are easily managed with batteries at the charging locations to buffer and arbitrage electricity. There are studies with very bad assumptions about battery energy densities and prices which try to pretend that delivering three times as much electricity to refueling stations to make hydrogen for truck fuel is somehow almost as cheap or that sending 14 times as many tankers with hydrogen to truck stops to support them is remotely reasonable, but they don’t stand up to scrutiny and should be ignored. At this point you have to have a significant bias for hydrogen to claim that it’s required or competitive.\n\nBut there are challenges with this model as well. Autonomous trucking and autonomous platooning of freight trucks is a foregone conclusion, even if promised delivery timetables have slipped. That’s going to have an inevitable downward pressure on required rest stops. And automated loading and unloading of tractors at depots is putting downward pressure on the time available when the truck is receiving or discharging its load. However, given that energy costs for electric trucking are so much lower than diesel even without pricing carbon, I just see this as an operational optimization exercise, one which I have every faith in the logistics expertise of trucking firms to resolve.\n\nCebon and I spoke about another alternative which he favors and I consider less likely to be necessary, which is putting overhead trolley wires above lanes of heavy trucking routes and adding extensible connectors — pantographs — to the top of semi tractors. This is completely technically viable, is a century old technology used with buses, trolleys and heavy trains globally and would enable the semis to both run on grid electricity and charge their batteries for periods off the highway. And it’s entirely possible to put range extending generators on trucks running biodiesel for really odd circumstances.\n\nThere’s nothing technically difficult about these options, and it’s likely that they will be used in some places as interim solutions until very high speed chargers and high-energy density batteries are everywhere.\n\nIs there any real world evidence to support massive electrification of trucking? Yes, there is. China has over 500,000 electric trucks on its roads already and is adding more daily. Meanwhile there are rounding error numbers of trucks with hydrogen and other alternatives to batteries and electric motors. The test has been run. Battery electric won.\n\nThe USA’s transportation blueprint and hydrogen strategy are both based on broken assumptions and bad faith efforts to justify hydrogen, driven in large part by Congress forcing the authors to give the US fossil fuel industry a future. Similar problems exist in Europe, where they are intending to build a massive hydrogen pipeline effort assuming hydrogen will be shipped to ports like Rotterdam for use in transportation and heating applications.\n\nBut these efforts to perpetuate the hydro in hydrocarbon will crash on the shoals of physics and economics, the Scylla and Charybdis of hydrogen for energy. Just as with everything else, the future of trucking is electric.",

California who is leading the charge nationwide for electric trucks has said they cannot increase the gross vehicle weight limit beyond 82,000lbs or it would make thousands of bridges off-limits, essentially stopping truck cargo from moving. Frito lay and Pepsi are light cargos. Chips and non-dense sodas are some of the lightest use-cases in the industry which is why they were chosen for pilot programs.\n\nMost food and commodities are very heavy, pushing the maximum allowable gross weight in every single load. A battery electric or hydrogen truck weighs an average of 8-10,000lbs more than a conventional diesel. This makes effective cargo weights be lowered by 25%, which means more trucks on the road, more expensive for basic food and commodities, and more strain on a power grid that already cannot support California’s needs.\n\nEven if someone wanted to convert right now to electric trucks, major players like PGE are giving 5+ year build outs for private charging for trucking, and as more demand comes in that will get worse. For small companies that own 1-5 trucks and park in third party lots they don’t own have no access to charging, and there are basically 0 public charging infrastructure being built.\n\nWhen the technology and charging infrastructure improves, maybe this will be a possibility, but it is far from easy and is currently no where close. California’s mandate is way too aggressive for this industry which is absolutely critical for everyone that lives in the US. Mandating these changes and making this industry vastly more inefficient and expensive will hyper charge inflation.",

It certainly does take longer (today) to recharge an EV (any EV) than to pump in fossil fuels. However, just like battery energy densities, charge speeds will continue to improve in the next 5-10 years until it too is a nonissue.\n\nTesla is nearing 1 megawatt charging right now with its v4 Superchargers. They claim something like 700kw charging in 30 mins. Even if the Tesla Semi only sees 1mi/kw efficiency, that’s still 700 miles on a 30 min charge.

A semi needs to run for 12-16 hours a day minimum and Tesla's, which is admittedly the best in terms of battery capacity, can work for 6-8 under load and then it needs 6-8 hours to recharge.\n\nAnd if you did have a magical truck with a battery that exceeds all current technology by 4-5x in terms of capacity and charging time, it would take decades for clean power on the grid to catch up with that demand. People underestimate just how much power an 18 wheeler is actually consuming during normal duty.\n\nAnd the electric trucks that are currently on the road are a joke. Even the pickups can't perform in that role. They're good for people who like driving a truck but don't actually nees one. If you put them at 50% of their payload or towing capacity, it cuts the range by >60%. They're a nice novelty for early adopters but they can't do the work that a hybrid puckup can, which is by far the more environmentally friendly option right now.",

Also charge time is an issue.\n\nThere is a ton of energy in gasoline/diesel for pretty little weight. A battery is always full weight no matter how full. And that’s weight needs to be moved as well. Because of this a battery less electric vehicle would be a lot more efficient. That’s the main thing stopping electric freight since it is a lot better, lower maintenance, nicer to drive, ...\n\nRealistically electrified highways would be the solution to this.\n\nEdit for more context: To drive a mile a semi truck uses about about half a liter of diesel fuel this costs about 0,6€ This is at most 1.5 kwh that effectively being used since these motors aren’t highly efficient in turning chemical energy in movement, a lot gets lost as heat. 1.5 kwh would cost about 12 cents wholesale.\n\nThis means there is a 48 cents per mile margin for companies or governments to install and run overhead power lines. With up to 400 miles per day per truck that’s a lot of room for investment, especially when it means less additional weight on roads and savings on road maintenance and healthcare and the government is likely to step in as well for initial funding.",

What if I started making erotic, photo-realistic images of T Swift by hand? In the privacy of my own home, I don't see the problem with that. But what if I share them online? Is it just a harmless fantasy? What if I start making money from it on Patreon? What if I start posting them to Tay-Tay fan groups? What if I show up to an event where she is giving autographs and I ask her to sign one?\n\nThat's the real underlying concern. GenAI is just making it much more prevalent because now you don't have to be a gifted artist to make your porn clones. I think the conversation should be about the core issue and be treated with real concern. I don't really agree with slamming down laws and regs without careful evaluation first, nor do I think we should be propagating porn of folks that don't consent to it. I don't buy the \"it's going to happen anyway\" argument either. Some kind of balance needs to be struck.",

If it's ruled that it's not fair use, and there is no acceptable amount of unlicensed content that can be in training data, that will cause a rush on buying up content sources, to protect current AI models, and prevent future ones. This would be a horrible outcome.\n\nHowever, the issue is that users can used trained LLMs to engage in copyright infringement. The real problem is copyright holders have gotten used to going to Google and having a quick resolution to any potential copyright issues that pop up on YouTube. Copyright holders absolutely do not want to have to go after individuals committing copyright infringement with AI. That is why they are trying to go after the GenAI companies and their even bigger partners.\n\nJust don't forget that companies that own lots of intellectual property, like Disney, Warner Bros-Discovery, New York times, and Netflix, also includes Amazon (MGM, Prime Video, Audible, Amazon Publishing), Microsoft (Microsoft Gaming, lots of software products), Apple (Apple TV+, lots of software products) and potentially Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia, AMD, Intel, etc. depending on how website data and code is classified.\n\nLetting Disney and others bump up copyrights to nearly a century or even longer in some cases, really screwed everybody but a few corporations that can horde intellectual property.",

Now Spotify only had to settle with the class once to provide payments and legally have the rights to stream all the music.\n\nSimilarly here, once every copyright holder is put into a class to sue OpenAI.

Going after the process upstream may seem ham handed and unreasonable but it’s the more realistic option for controlling what happens after it goes into generative AI.\n\nExample: if people keep asking for the AI to make them a picture of a cartoon mouse and the AI keeps making pictures eerily similar to Mickey Mouse, Disney sort of has a leg to stand on here in telling them to not allow any forms of Mickey to be fed into the input of the model because the output is clearly derived from their IP.\n\nThe problem is that Generative AI doesn’t make anything new or create anything, it serves up a statistical average of all of its input based on the user’s requested output parameters.\n\nFanfic authors have landed in hot water for years for the same reasons. Their output relies upon existing and copyrighted IP.\n\nPeople bemoan the copyright and patent system but without it there wouldn’t be any point in making anything new at all since anyone could come steal your idea and put it to market first, or someone can take your song that you made and put the effort into and sell it themselves and keep all the money.",

Well, the individual creators aren't gonna get market value, so we better let these companies do whatever they want with whoever's work they happen to find!\n\nArtists should have a say over whether their work becomes part of a dataset like this. That's not an insane or impossible position to have. If a company wants to use an artist's work as part of the data set, they can arrange to license it. If they have an existing relationship with owners of media databases, they can figure it out with those providers.\n\nIf I'm an independent artist, these companies shouldn't be able to scrape my website without my permission and use it as part of their dataset.\n\nSo the net result would be: (1) only large content library owners will get any money, (2) there will only be a handful of large AI companies with no chance for smaller startups to create better/more ethical alternatives\n\nSadly, (1) has been true for some types of media for a while now. Musicians traditionally get single digit percentages of sales of their music, with the big labels taking almost all the profit. It's not that different for book publishers, and even for images, Getty and the like exist purely to achieve that business goal.\n\n(2) is also true as well.\n\nSo if the consequences of allowing artists better control over whether their work is used for generative AI is that a few large media corporations make most of the money, and super well funded tech companies make it harder for smaller startups... what, and the sun will rise? The sky will be blue? Doesn't sound like those are consequences so much as the way things are.",

If authors have never been allowed to read copyrighted works in their whole lives, how can they write an award winning novel?\n\nInspiration is fundamental to creating new and more perfected things. I feel like regulation might be helpful to stop outright theft, but you shouldn't stop it from learning and advancing humanity because you're upset that you can't compete.\n\nThat's like someone that made their living by forging thousands of horseshoes in the 1800s suddenly time traveled to the 2020s, and then starts bitching about how automobiles should be banned because he isn't selling horseshoes now. Like, yeah. Duh. That's progress. Nobody is bending over backwards for 1800s guy. Newspaper printers got pissed when people stopped buying newspapers; so what? That's progress. This is how markets operate.\n\nIf you want to paint, paint. If you want to write, write. Those original creations of yours should be protected from outright exact copies.

This is a new issue. So for you to say with absolute certainty that this is illegal and they need to be STOPPED, is completely fucking asinine. There's no law regarding the usage of copyrighted content for use in a deep learning algorithm. There's copyright law, yes, that doesn't make this open and shut.",

Technology ruining livelihoods is never going to feel good though I’d also suggest you can’t put the genie back in the bottle. China for example will undoubtedly use AI even if it’s banned elsewhere.\n\nHowever, whenever this is discussed, I always think what is the human analogue to what AI is doing? Imagine you are an artist, and you travel around the world viewing all the most famous galleries. After you finish you then paint a painting that is inspired by everything you saw. That’s not illegal and to me it feels like what AI is doing?\n\nI’m open to being challenged here so keen to hear any counter arguments. Please just be constructive 🙏",

Most of what I've read boils down to\n\nyea but like..it takes that person a long time to do that!\n\nSo..more or less just a speed argument. The amount of assistance and actual good work AI does is incredible. I for one and glad the cat is out of the bag, and agree that there is no chance to ever pretend it can be put back inside. Art is entirely subjective, always has been and always will be. Now the subjective value of art is (potentially) lower than ever due to ease of accessibility. If avg joe doesn't see value in your art, why should a corporation who is by default incentivized toward profit? I can pay someone X to do something, or I can pay (or not yarrr) for Y AI to do the same thing cheaper with 99% of the results (or 100 to be honest). Artists who want to distinguish themselves will need to put in more work, change their offerings, and adapt to what the market wants.\n\nHell I'd say the amount of artists impacted by this probably don't care about any of the millions of artists whose work went unseen daily before AI, but because it affects them somehow it matters more now. The X% of artists who were successful was already a small number, and no one wanted to defend or speak out against advertising or platform hosting or <insert other imbalance here>. Now that AI is the imbalance and it can affect everyone suddenly it matters.",

AI as it exists now is not actual intelligence, it's more like a beefed up version of your phone's texting auto predict.\n\nThere was a time when art did not exist. A human being invented it, with no other artist to become inspired from. An AI cannot do this. Humans have thoughts and emotions and stories. Humans don't just reproduce an approximation of what they've seen, they add their own ideas to it.\n\nGoing to an art gallery and becoming inspired by the art there is not what an AI is doing. AI cannot become inspired, and does not know what art even is. AI does not know anything at all. All AI does is detect associations, and spit back out an amalgamation of what it has been given according to what words or color values the training data had in close association.\n\nAI cannot exist without stealing data from real human beings. AI must be fed on human creativity. Human creativity that was harvested without consent, for the profit of a large company. They are taking someone else's work and then using that to not only make a profit, but to put those same artists out of work.\n\nAnd remember this important fact- AI does not do anything on its own. AI is an inanimate thing, a tool to use. Imagine AI as a rock that has been thrown. We're sitting here arguing over if the rock has a right to fly, but the rock does not fly on its own.

Just a quick example:\n\nReddit is obsessed with rules and fighting automation. They are so prude. They expect the best from you. They even have a team called \"Anti Evil Team\". That tells you how they see themselves. They're the heroes.\n\nHowever, besides the usual not respecting your data and using it for whatever they might use it that we really have no clear idea of, Reddit started as a lie. They would literally create fake posts to make the site appear more busy than it was.\n\nThat's fine. I understand it. However, it's not so fine if you try to fake engagement, right? You can't create an account to upvote your own comments. You can't send fake subscribers to your sub. However, they could do all of that. Nothing was expected of them.\n\nYour growth has to be organic. You can't give it a little push. Their growth wasn't organic at all.\n\nAnd wow, they're so alert about HATE SPEECH. Don't you even dare to comment anything SLIGHTLY upsetting to ANY minority.\n\nHowever, the owner of this very site went to the servers and changed a comment a user had made about him and completely rewrote it to something else, making it seem the user said something he didn't.\n\nRules are for you, not for them.",

Photography competitions are for photographers, so piss off with your prompts.\n\nDo you see people entering painting exhibitions with digital cameras? No, because that would be fucking stupid. If you want to measure who's better at prompting, then enter an AI contest and fuck off. People who enter photography contests want to do photos.\n\nNone of what you have said has been proven to come to fruition and because I think you have an extremely poor understanding of what AI is.\n\nAt this point, I believe you're either 12 or you didn't witness how things changed for some reason. Have you seen any big popular Hollywood movie, recently? Are you really ready to say with your full chest that \"quality will not be superseded by quantity\"? Because if so, then I guess we're living in parallel universes.\n\nThe movies I see are CGI-filled artificial crap even though I KNOW they can be different, because I saw both LOTR and The Hobbit and these movies are fucking different from each other. Guess why? You're right, because artificiality is cheaper and faster and the crowds don't care if you give them some big names and nostalgia factor to care about.\n\nFor the millionth time, your boss doesn't fucking care if you produce quality work. They care if it sells. And if everything is shit or shit is much cheaper than non-shit, it will sell.",

How much have you studied the field to be able to share an opinion?\n\nYour point was made by disregarding/misinterpreting mine, as you're the one who replied to my comment first, not the other way around. My point, in case you're wondering or care, was that artists will no longer have much of an incentive to produce anything because their work may be stolen or not reimbursed appropriately, which already happens to an extent (see the very thread we're in). It was not that AI will somehow take over the world.\n\nThe main way AI can replace any field now is not by being better than humans at it, but by producing such high volumes of work (be it good or bad) that it's no longer viable to perform in that field as a human, or that it's way more difficult to make your name known.

So far, AI has not been able to exceed the knowledge of humans, only apply it in new ways - some of which seem better than we could have done (which is not actually the case).\n\nFor those who represent the most intelligent, they can now use AI to garner the intelligence of others in their own pursuits.\n\nIf artistic talent is replaced (or fulfilled) by AI then those same artistic traits will find a new niche to fulfill - this is a net gain for all.\n\nYes transition pain will be had by some, but that's progression.

I cannot make copies of the print or other types of art based on the print. But there is gray area here in the derivative works analysis.\n\nIt feels like you are taking about a digital image.

The early internet didn't have the DMCA or fair use provisions that would allow things like google image search to exist.\n\nGoogle will do an image search but that doesn't invalidate the images copyright.\n\nStrawman. I didn't say google image search invalidates copyright.\n\nI said google was copying copyrighted images onto their servers and serving them up to people on request.\n\nWhich ought to be a violation of their copyright, same as you believe AI to be. But it's not considered a violation. Nor should AI be. AI is a useful tool and produces new works which are not copies of the originals it was trained on.\n\nIf I take an image and scale it down to 1x1 and then post that single pixel online, have I violated their copyright? Do they own the copyright to one of the 2 billion colors you can produce with RGB? And what if two entirely unique distinct images produce the same color?\n\nAI monetizes copyright material without crediting the author.\n\nNo, it montizes new works that loosely replicate that appearance of copyrighted material. Just as artists do when they look at an image and draw something similar.\n\nGen X fucked up if they made the internet & school so easy people don't understand copyright & fair use.\n\nYou're the one who doesn't understand copyright was not written to prevent you from preventing people or AI's from learning from your works and outputting wholly new works that MAY be similar but are clearly not identical.\n\nBut sure - if ChaptGPT wasn't a for profit company, didn't lie about sources/direct quotes/paraphrasing, what it was doing would ostensbily be fair use.\n\nMy god, and you say my generation doesn't understand copyright.\n\nWhether the thing you are making is free or not does not alter whether it infringes on copyright.

Kettles?) which is to make it illegal to gain anything at all, ever from their IP unless you specifically pay for it under an explicit license. That includes basically all fair use, including stuff that's so incredibly obvious (like learning how to draw, in part, by looking at copyrighted drawings) that there's not even any specific case law about it -- just an umbrella category that everyone very sanely assumes includes it.\n\nThey also want to try to grab another brass ring while they're at it: being able to utterly flood the world with their IP both physically and digitally (newspapers, magazines, billboards, plastic cups, paper bags, you fuckin' name it) and then do a This Is Spinal Tap and say you're not even allowed to look at it... and also not accept any responsibility for cleaning up after themselves, which they should if they're only selling licenses and not anything physical.

The AI isn't a library, it's the equivalent of a person who has read all the books in the library and has a good memory, but not good enough to recall the actual text in the books.\n\nYou can't reproduce a book, a piece of music or an artwork with AI.

Sure. That's not what this is about.\n\nThere are living artists currently being ripped off because torrents of their works are being used to train AI. Works that aren't free anywhere. \n\nWe're not talking about 300 year old paintings, we're talking about material made 5 years ago, etc.\n\nI was making fun of you because you were grouping all online art as if it's all just free. I teased you by using paying for internet as a basic level of payment-for-access to demonstrate you still can't access those free, 300 year old paintings, without paying-to-play first. But the joke went too far and I'm sorry for pushing your buttons like that.\n\nThe point was always about currently copyrighted, not-free, works being torrented and used in AI outputs. Cheers!",

It would certainly be better if AI services do the same, but strictly speaking, if they didn't alter the work enough to make it substantially different from the original, it's still infringement. Of course, usually image generating AI services do produce something different. But even then people complain that they're using elements of original works to do it. What's interesting to me is how you distinguish between a person using elements from other works to create something, and an AI doing it. Isn't AI just a tool like Photoshop? If so, does a person using Photoshop to morph someone else's work into something totally different violate copyright?\n\nAgain, I don't know the answers. But it doesn't seem cut and dry to me. I think artists should be rewarded far more richly than most currently are. But there's got to be ways to do that without trying to shut down AI, which I think will ultimately fail anyway.",

And I am taking the worse case interpretation where the inputs are definitely copyrighted work. “Copyright”, the rights to control a copy. You can see how this breaks down pretty quickly depending on how a copy is defined.\n\nNow here is the kicker. Those sites that claim to be art platforms, their use contracts spell out that they get rights to use the content and they can share or sell access to those content to their partners, affiliates, and customers. The “free” platforms are not free. It is yielding control over the distribution of the art in exchange for the service of the platform, retaining only the strictest definition of the copyright protections.\n\nThe majority of verified artists who use the platforms willfully sign away controls; think about that.\n\nWhen I write these words, I am yielding the control of the words to Reddit to sell API access to ML trainers that will consume these words and train the next AI. It is in the user agreement.\n\nThese words will be used to train more powerful AIs that are used to disenfranchise Hollywood script writers. While that fact is unethical, it is not illegal.",

Just because it learned patterns from a copyrighted image, doesn't mean it stole the image. The image is publicly accessible. It's not providing copies of the image, it's learning from it. Just like a person would who is studying art styles.\n\nWhat does a search engine do? Uses bots to scrape data from millions of websites, read them looking for specific patterns, and then produce a list of sites that match the pattern you're looking for when you search.\n\nLearning from someone else's work isn't violating copyright. A teenager creating art of their OC in the style of Akira Toriyama's DragonBall characters isn't violating any copyright. They weren't violating copyright by referencing the style by watching the series on TV as a kid.\n\nIt's just technological advancement, which creative individuals always had the general opinion on that they couldn't be replaced by. The idea that a factory worker's job is eventually going to be replaced by a machine, so that's fine, but artwork/music/creative writing takes a human touch and can never be replaced.

That’s one company who hasn’t even done much in the ai space yet, it was just announced a few weeks ago so I doubt much of that hardware has even been turned on yet, but it will be soon.\n\nIncreased consumption offsets efforts to replace fossil fuels, so yes this tech shares some of the blame and needs to be called out.

We now have Skynet.\n\nNot necessarily in any combat capability either .. given existing AF staffing woes, being able to completely automate all non-human non-tactical logistics flights would singlehandedly free up hundreds of pilots for actual combat missions which means the AF can massively decrease it's labor budget. In this case, the obvious choice would be for the new MQ-25 tanker. This is also how full auto planes come to American airports for Fedex, UPS and Amazon. Which will follow as by then, most airport ground vehicles will be completely self-driving AVs too. The only humans actually needed are the ones demanded by insurance companies.\n\nThis problem is especially severe for smaller, non-american countries that can't afford a real human air force. Now, they'll just be able to buy one and be immediately able to challenge the US. Most of it will be sold by China, the arsenal against democracy.",

You're kinda screwed if that client asks for the videos back.\n\nCould you store on the cloud? Sure but that's not a reliable solution either, google HAS had issues before.\n\nWith RAID you can pop in lets say 20 - 20TB hard drives with say 5 drives which act as backups. Using RAID an having a backup of that data stored one some of the other drives you can ensure you can recover from that data issue.\n\nOr let's say you are Fortnite and you want to save peoples identities, or other critical info.... you use this.",

I can say that Apple has the biggest group of twats who are full of themselves and don't care to want to collaborate with other leaders in the tech space. We actually just make fun of them because theyve got such egos.",

They are often the best out of what's available for my user case. This doesn't mean they are good on an absolute scale, just on a relative scale when compared to stuff like \"why does Windows have ads in the OS\" and similar issues. But I've seen their product presentations and product/performance comparisons (often technically correct in a very precise way but also made by switching what's being measured between two slides just so much to make themselves look better when consistency in presentation would show just a slight improvement. But they have to be able to boast every second in each one hour video :/\n\nAnd then all the gaslighting around their app store, talking as if they invented online commerce with iOS and who knows what else. It's pathetic and makes me roll my eyes whenever they start talking about their accomplishments.\n\nOr their recent \"shot on iPhone\" thing where they shot the whole ad on iPhone. When people point out that everything else is high level professional cinema equipment, the point is not that the iPhone can keep up with cinema cameras but that when you spent hundreds of thousands or millions on a video project then the difference between paying for an iPhone vs. a pro cinema camera is more or less a rounding error (even if the iPhone can under specific conditions keep up, and may even be better if you need a specific shot in tight spaces). You'd simply go with the pro camera because you don't want to rely on a consumer product maybe failing at those budgets (heat, lenses, storage, whatever).\n\nAnd if you are not Apple but an indie film maker or small production studio (who can't simply buy/rent the best of the best of stuff around their camera) then your camera also matters more. You can't endlessly re-shoot just to get a point across about your consumer smartphone being \"as capable as pro equipment\" if you have to work within a budget. Just because something can be done if you have infinite time and money and don't have to worry about outside pressure, doesn't mean it's the smart thing to do for everybody else.\n\nIt's all just so insecure and petty and makes me dislike them as an organisation for simply lacking grace and humility even if they make some devices I really like to use (I'm typing this on a Mac mini through Firefox right now). The company as an entity feels weirdly inhuman, kinda like the \"model people\" they show using their products in their presentations.",

An old battery can be unable to provide that full power while maintaining the minimum operating voltage of the system. That situation can and will result in random reboots and shutdowns in situations where the battery could still run the phone at a lower power for a long time. We've all seen it trying to operate a phone with an old battery at 23% in cold weather.\n\nThe idea of slowing down the phone seemed like one I would have been happy to invent, just from an engineering standpoint, to prevent crashes and to provide a soft landing for an aging battery.\n\nThe main problem was that it wasn't communicated to the customers and made optional. It should have been made clear in notifications that the phone has measured battery degradation and enabled this performance limit that the user could override if they so desired. It should make clear that swapping the battery to a new good one will restore the phone to unthrottled performance. I do believe that this is a feature that every phone should have, because having your phone crash at 30% battery, trying to order an Uber home when it's below freezing outside is both terrible and preventable.\n\nAnd no, I have never owned an iPhone and just ordered an S24, which I hope will have this feature.",

Apple being the developer of the underlying platform is still doing more, and providing more than a simple app store. Being a business they're going to charge for it, and the EU is unlikely to prevent a business charging for things that cost them money.\n\nThe regulation (amongst a couple other things) specifically opens up the app store aspect of the business. Apple will continue to charge 10-17% commission for the use of theirs and the CT charge applies the same to apps on their store. So that will be the potential market competitors can offer alternatives for.\n\nThere's argument to be had over the level of the CT charge. Obviously 100mil per user would be unreasonable. So too would nothing, you can't realistically force a business to work for free. Is €0.50? There's probably an aspect of apple ripping the arse out of it, but it's a sure bet some apple accountant will be able to rustle you up a list of what they're charging for.\n\nWhat it is is an opportunity for competitors to take a slice of whatever 10-17% commission on app stores trades brings in by offering an alternative. What it's not is the EU deciding iOS should be a free platform, which despite what people may want, I think is a fanciful expectation.",

It is your hardware and it is absolutely ridiculous that you cannot install what you want on it. No matter what Apple says, it is a very anti-consumer behaviour that they do because it is extremely profitable for them. It gives Apple extreme control that they simply shouldn't have.\n\nMy worry is that if they get away with it we will see more and more of this stuff. It is not a big problem on phones because phones are used in fairly specific ways. It would definitely be a problem on computers and while that is not happening now, the companies have a huge incentive to do the same thing and if they can get away with it they will do it.\n\nIt's not just Apple either, Android is much more open, but still much more locked than computers are and a big reason why they can get away with it is that they are at least better than Apple.",

When the options are ride a heavy and slow tire all the time without flats or ride a much better performing tire where you might need to take the five minutes to swap out or patch a tube a couple of times a year it's not a hard decision to make.",

If the fire department shows up to a warehouse on fire and there is uninterruptible DC power, they are gonna let that thing burn to the ground. Seems it's cheaper to mitigate a fire by not selecting the lowest bidder.
