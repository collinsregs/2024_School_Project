If you're using router QOS you may want to test what having both machines preferred feels like, and if it's too bad using the bandwidth test in OBS, I would just prefer the streaming PC and eat the network issues on the gaming PC.

If you start dropping packets, you may need to adjust your router's QOS settings to favor your device over others on the network. (If your router supports SQM, definitely enable it!)\n\nYou should probably cap your FPS in Valorant and all games, as running it with an infinite limit is going to cause issues with streaming (you will overload the GPU encoder).

It's not very common on low to mid-grade routers- you'll likely see a single toggle for QOS enabling, and possibly a by-protocol configuration.

There are tons of options you can use. Whatsapp, Skype, Google meet, Signal, among others. Does she have the gmail app?

You might be able to recover data from it, but you'll need to remove it and stop using it immediately while you get the PC set up to attempt recovery.\n\nTime for a new SSD, something like an m.2 USB enclosure for the faulty drive (unless you have a spare m.2 slot), and a visit to r/datarecovery to learn more?",

The drive is effectively totally dead. Best case? It's unlockable with a decryption key (that you hopefully have access to from the proof of purchase email or something). Or thirdly, it could only be partially recoverable after some hardware failure.\n\nHopefully, you can find out more.

Ideally you'd re-seat the CPU and GPU, and RAM. I'd also reseat any power connectors to be safe.\n\nAnother easy thing to try is to reset CMOS. This can be accomplished by removing the coin battery on the mobo or shorting the 2 specific pins for this purpose (may need to check manual to see where). This will reset your BIOS.\n\nAlso, give it a couple minutes even if it shows nothing. Some machines take a while to do memory training, especially AMD CPUs. If you shut it off after 30 seconds you might just need to wait more. I've had a machine that posted only after like 5-10 minutes once.",

Don't forget to uninstall your current driver first and reboot before you attempt to install. Let me know how it goes",

It's possible the battery isnt supplying enough power but its also possible thats just how it was designed. Putting the power plan on max performance should fix it but I've experienced the behavior even while doing that.\n\nI wouldnt say this means its defective. Go by the actual battery life instead.\n\nHere are some things you can try:\n\nCheck the power plan\n\nGo to Settings > System > Power & Sleep > Additional power settings. Check if the power plan is set to optimize performance when on battery power. You can also try changing the plan to High Performance.\n\nChange the settings\n\nGo to Control Panel (from search box at lower left), Power Options, Change Plan Settings, Change Advanced Power Settings. Scroll down to Processor Power Management, Maximum Processor State, On battery, and set to 100%.",

Dump files are crash logs from BSODs.\n\nIf you can get into Windows normally or through Safe Mode could you check C:\\Windows\\Minidump for any dump files? If you have any dump files, copy the folder to the desktop, zip the folder and upload it. If you don't have any zip software installed, right click on the folder and select Send to → Compressed (Zipped) folder.\n\nUpload to any easy to use file sharing site. Reddit keeps blacklisting file hosts so find something that works, currently catbox.moe or mediafire.com seems to be working.\n\nWe like to have multiple dump files to work with so if you only have one dump file, none or not a folder at all, upload the ones you have and then follow this guide to change the dump type to Small Memory Dump. The \"Overwrite dump file\" option will be grayed out since small memory dumps never overwrite.\n\nI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Dump files are crash logs from BSODs.\n\nIf you can get into Windows normally or through Safe Mode could you check C:\\Windows\\Minidump for any dump files? If you have any dump files, copy the folder to the desktop, zip the folder and upload it. If you don't have any zip software installed, right click on the folder and select Send to → Compressed (Zipped) folder.\n\nUpload to any easy to use file sharing site. Reddit keeps blacklisting file hosts so find something that works, currently catbox.moe or mediafire.com seems to be working.\n\nWe like to have multiple dump files to work with so if you only have one dump file, none or not a folder at all, upload the ones you have and then follow this guide to change the dump type to Small Memory Dump. The \"Overwrite dump file\" option will be grayed out since small memory dumps never overwrite.\n\nI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What happened before I bought the new board is the old board's 12V pin was damaged.\n\n​\n\nIs the motherboard firmware updated?\n\nSorry, but did you mean BIOS, latest drivers or something else?

According to the CPU support page for this model, as of FB version, the board should accept Godavari CPUs, which includes A10-7870K.\n\n​\n\nHow do you know it's a CPU issue and not say RAM or display issue?

I have 2 sticks of Kingston HyperX Fury (8 GB each). I was able to enter BIOS and boot to windows with these. If I install the A10, no display/no beeps. I couldn't say for sure if it's brand new but it looks new. I just bought it online from a local store. I had a hard time looking for replacement for the board because FM2 is obsolete. I see some cheap boards that I haven't heard of but I don't like them.\n\nI appreciate your inputs. Thank you.\n\nEdit: additional details",

Actually shutting off due to how hot it's getting is really bad. Depending on how hot it gets it does have the potential to cause harm, eventually. What usually happens in that case is you need more vcore to hit the CPUs normal speed. As well sudden shutdowns can corrupt files rendering Windows unable to boot, or actually losing data files.\n\nTBH you really need to fix things before continuing even if you aren't going to \"break\" your CPU. How old is your PC and is it an OEM or DiY? What type of CPU cooler are you using? What type of case and how many fans does it have? Can you post pictures of the PC, both outside and the interior? Are you comfortable working in and/or updating the BIOS?\n\nIf you find any of those questions a bit overwhelming IMHO you need to either contact support if it has any sort of warranty. Or take it in to a reputable shop for a complete check up. It could be something simple like a BIOS auto setting the vcore too high (it does happen). Or something silly like a protection strip on the CPU heatsink not being removed (which also does happen). But it might be something more complicated too.",

If you don't have any zip software installed, right click on the folder and select Send to → Compressed (Zipped) folder.\n\nUpload to any easy to use file sharing site. Reddit keeps blacklisting file hosts so find something that works, currently catbox.moe or mediafire.com seems to be working.\n\nWe like to have multiple dump files to work with so if you only have one dump file, none or not a folder at all, upload the ones you have and then follow this guide to change the dump type to Small Memory Dump.

Whether you're playing music or not has very little effect.\n\nAs far as safety, it's fine to charge your phone through your laptop, though it will charge slower through the laptop than it would from a wall charger in most scenarios.\n\nLink with context and math involved to find cost of charging your phone:\n\nhttps://www.howtogeek.com/842679/how-much-does-it-cost-to-charge-your-smartphone-for-a-year/",

I'm not any more a fan of my country than y'all seem to be.\n\nHowever I spend a lot of time on help forums, and follow up replies from end users are unreliable. It is unreasonable to assume I could ask them what country they're from and then answer. THE COUNTRY WITH THE MOST USERS IS AMERICA.\n\nDoesn't really matter how you construe my answer, that much is true. So, in a situation where my answer does not change based on the country they live in, I'm going to assume America if they're speaking proper american English. I'm not clairvoyant. In this case the amount of electricity we're talking about is as negligible as it gets, and then to further split hairs between charging from the wall versus charging from the laptop, we're talking infinitesimal.\n\nY'all need to get over yourselves.",

What you keep calling a \"majority\" is a plurality.\n\nThis is more than just mathematical pendantry--chances are greater than 50% that a random reddit user is not American. More importantly, the concepts of majority and plurality are vital to democracy. But honestly, as an American who enjoyed math class, it's mostly just embarrassing that you keep confidently calling 25% a majority.\n\nTo be fair, klutz is definitely overreacting to somebody using American data and it's safe to assume the majority of reddit users are in countries with affordable electricity.

It's my intuition that there is a degree of energy lost to heat in charging the laptop battery and then discharging it. If it doesn't have a battery, then it's basically just passing through the electricity after doing all the normal conversions (although, it would convert 240V AC to some pd as DC, then down to 5V somewhere on the motherboard, but I don't know how different that is to 240V AC down to 5V in one go). As for any more inefficiencies, we're talking about the resistence of wires, which isn't very much.\n\nAlthough this all changes if your laptop is actually running, even in sleep mode (keeping the RAM powered), and using a baseline of energy. I'm not sure when USB ports are live, so that's why I gave my answer as if the laptop was off.",
