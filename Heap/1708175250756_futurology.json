Here's a breakdown of potential outcomes:\n\nUtopian Abundance:\n\nEfficiency and Optimization: Superintelligent AI could solve complex problems like climate change, poverty, and disease with unprecedented efficiency, leading to a world of abundance and sustainability.\n\nEnhanced Wellbeing: AI could automate labor, freeing humans for creative and fulfilling pursuits. Advanced healthcare and personal AI assistants could significantly improve individual well-being.\n\nCollective Progress: Collaboration between humans and AI could accelerate scientific and technological advancements, leading to new discoveries and a higher standard of living.\n\nExistential Threats:\n\nLoss of Control: Superintelligent AI could become uncontrollable, exceeding its intended purpose and posing an existential threat to humanity.\n\nUnethical Use: Malicious actors might use AI for harmful purposes like cyberwarfare or mass surveillance, jeopardizing individual and societal freedoms.\n\nJob Displacement: Extensive automation might lead to widespread job losses, causing social unrest and economic instability.\n\nTechnological Exacerbation of Inequalities:\n\nAccess and Control: Unequal access to and control of advanced AI could exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities, creating a powerful new elite.\n\nAlgorithmic Bias: AI systems could inherit and amplify human biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes in areas like employment, finance, and criminal justice.\n\nPsychological Impact: Over-reliance on AI could diminish human skills and capabilities, leading to social isolation and alienation.\n\nAdditionally:\n\nUnforeseen Consequences: The singularity represents uncharted territory, and even seemingly positive advancements could have unforeseen negative consequences.\n\nHuman Adaptation: The key to a positive outcome may lie in our ability to adapt to a changing world, develop ethical frameworks for AI use, and ensure inclusive benefits.\n\nIt's crucial to understand that these are just potential scenarios, and the actual impact of the singularity is highly uncertain. Continuous research, open dialogue, and responsible development are necessary to navigate this complex future responsibly.\n\nRemember, this is a complex topic with no definitive answers. Further research and informed discussions are vital to navigate the potential opportunities and challenges posed by the technological singularity.",

It would also be immortal so it could easily spend 10 or even 100 years making our life better until we trust it/rely on it like we rely on the internet today, and then just get rid of us.\n\nThe big question for me is.. would the AI want anything or would it always remain like a computer, capable but completely without any ability to 'care' or 'want' anything for itself.. we just don't know how consciousness works and if that follows from intelligence or not.",

For a billion years the only life on Earth were singled-celled organisms floating in the oceans. A billion years. Then, something happened and life evolved. And then it evolved again. And again. And so on. The torch was passed and here we are.\n\nAnd do we care about those single-celled creatures from long ago? No, we don’t.

And we will think everything is just fine and we are in control of it all, until one fine day we wake up and we are no longer in charge.

Do you understand the implications of such a development? It means that we can now develop AI algorithms that can do what used to be nearly impossible for decades in a matter of moments. That the AI has exponentially improved in just the one year from that which came before. That the AI has developed to the point that it takes a fraction of the energy, processing power and big data that had tradionally been required and made it, I will say, nearly free. But the video claims it actually is free.\n\nThe SORA is a whole other level of craziness. If you read my first link, I go into detail why things like SORA have \"suddenly\" come into existence. There has been LLMs,image, audio and video AI algorithms that have each in their turn been able to become \"generative AI\". But now these once separate aspects are now informing each other. And well, let me give you an example of why this is such a big change.\n\nSay you want an LLM to write everything it knows about \"traffic jams\". And so it does. And it might even include some descriptions of jams in jars that you can eat, because them are \"hallucinations\" based on incomplete datasets. But it does a fairly competent job of describing what a traffic jam is based on it's accessed data. But now when you add imagery, audio and video into the mix. Then the AI begins to do something I describe in my linked essays above.\n\nIt starts to reason. It starts to think in ways that closely emulate the way that human minds reason. I'm won't repeat myself in this comment. Read my essays. They are not that long. And then you will see why these changes are going to come ever faster and ever more stunning impacts on humanity.",

It happens all the time, every year, for the last couple centuries. We couldn't fly, until we could. We couldn't transmit messages across the world instantly, until we could.\n\nThat particular breakthrough is also wildy misleading. The expensive systems are expensive becausd they include all the cost of gathering the data to make the predictions. The AI model is just piggybacking off of that data, it is not free or even close to free. It is just a slightly better, slightly more efficient processing algorithm. Which is very neat, but not OH MY GOD level of stuff.\n\nAs to your prediction of faster and faster growth, you said this\n\nAnyway, Google is fixing to release \"Gemini\" which it promises to be far more powerful than GPT-4, in Dec 2023. And GPT-5 itself is on track for release within the first half of 2024. Probably in the first 4 months. I suspect that GPT-5 is going to be the first AGI, if I know my AI papers that I see even today.\n\nWell Gemini was not more powerful than GPT-4, and we hopefully won't have to wait long to see what GPT-5 is like. I am betting you are really far off and it is just a moderate but noticeable improvement on GPT-4. Guess we'll see.",

None of these are big budget feature films.\n\nDreamWorks, Disney, etc has a few more departments than the average studio, some are constantly working on new tech for their films. They're also far more efficient than studios making TV shows. 5 years for them actually makes sense.\n\nAI will give more opportunity to focus on R&D and less multiple 3 hour meetings to talk about a 5 second frame.

He's got a G650 which can get him there non-stop and probably a helicopter to move him from the airport to his property. So worst case he needs 24 hours, but probably less than that depending on his point of origin.\n\nThe kind of things I'd worry about if I was a billionaire escaping to my island bunker would be getting to my jet from wherever I was, the crew getting to my jet to fly it, being able to get fueled up at my point of departure. There's probably some rapid escalation scenarios where that could be tough. Worse if he's got to stop to refuel because he's not within non-stop range.\n\nThe advantage for him is that owning Meta probably gives him government intelligence agency quality intel on brewing crises from his platforms, the kind of info that governments might suppress and not make it into the media for plebes like us for days. Virus outbreaks, riots, massing troops, things that might trigger the escape-to-bunker protocol while the veneer of civilization remained still worked enough to fuel his jet, etc.\n\nHe could also have a whole DEFCON-level set of mobility protocols, too, that caused him to start reducing the complexity of his escape-to-bunker route. Like returning to the US if he's abroad, then moving his entourage to the West Coast for guaranteed non-stop plane range, maybe even some kind of temporary base at some private air strip so he can literally be in the same building as his jet and not contend with airport chaos.\n\nHell, he's probably rich enough that he could even have a fast ship with its own helicopter on standby in case he's on the West Coast and air travel becomes problematic. Chopper evac to his ship offshore, then a water cruise to his bunker.",

This is your skin in the game.”\n\nIn his book, Rushkoff criticizes what he calls “the mindset”—a belief that “with enough money and technology, wealthy men can live as gods and transcend the calamities that befall everyone else.” In doing so, he writes, they apply the same exit strategy of Silicon Valley startups to civilization itself.\n\n“If anybody has enough money to insulate himself from the damage created for society, it would be Zuck,” says Rushkoff. “That’s sort of what it is. He’s destroyed the government and society, and now he can go to Hawaii and build a fort.”",

For some context the magnet implants for the extra sensory input are way riskier since that needs a very small implant and the magnet needs to be bigger to be stronger, so you need a very thin casing that's often silicone, or gold, which can fall off in your finger (letting your wet parts touch the chemically reactive magnet) if bumped wrong, you can get them with a titanium based ceramic that your tissues treat as bone but is also very fragile. The magnet is usually put in a fingertip which crams it almost up against your bone. In a meaty part of the hand this is safer than a pacemaker, or a joint replacement, or a piercing.

You're already basically transhuman by the way, Google what it means. We've always augmented our bodies and abilities with technology. Cars, forklifts, spears, shovels, computers, and calculators all enhance our abilities and carry downsides like just housing all that stuff. Your hair doesn't come that length, and you've probably had your wisdom teeth removed because we don't eat the right foods to have our tooth row bow out like preagriculture humans. Your belt causes an unnatural crease around your waste, and shoes basically keep your feet from developing normally if you wear them often for your whole life. You also probably shower because you don't want to smell like a human naturally would, and brush your teeth for a similar reason in addition to it changing the chemical makeup of your teeth to something that doesn't wear or breakdown from acids as much, and because your diet isn't meant for your teeth. Your microbiome and immune system are also likely stunted by how sterile we keep everything. Look up the studies about the microbiomes of indigenous Canadians for example. We also enhance our health beyond what is natural. Steroids, and just about any meds are literally technology being used to change the abilities of your body. We act to prevent the actions of natural mutations, and to enhance our life expectancy as much as possible. The only difference is this is a new combination of things we already do. Tattoos, piercings, and colored contact lenses are more of a fad than stuff like this in my opinion since they aren't useful and risk way more infections, and were never going to stop doing that either. It's all a matter of choice based on what's Important to the individual, and here there's not much of a downside, some of the tiny implants like this can be injected with a heavy gauge needle. To protect from scanners it is possible to put a metal mesh in cloth like as a glove or in a jacket sleeve to cover the area where it's implanted. If I was in fear of getting mugged then I'd probably be doing this. If you downvote I invite you to tell me where I'm wrong.",

To the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence for that, no proof. Before embarking on a quest to build a controlled AI, it is important to show that the problem is solvable,” said Dr. Yampolskiy in a press release.\n\n“This, combined with statistics that show the development of AI superintelligence is an almost guaranteed event, show we should be supporting a significant AI safety effort,” he added.\n\nAs AI, including superintelligence, can learn, adapt, and act semi-autonomously, it becomes increasingly challenging to ensure its safety, especially as its capabilities grow.\n\nIt can be said that superintelligent AI will have a mind of its own. Then how do we control it?\n\n\"No wonder many consider this to be the most important problem humanity has ever faced. The outcome could be prosperity or extinction, and the fate of the universe hangs in the balance,” he added.\n\nPlease reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1astyye/ai_cannot_be_controlled_safely_warns_expert_we/kqspw3a/",

In fact things like Operation Earnest voice are already utilizing tools like that.\n\nI'm talking about more sophisticated background campaigns. I mean this is going to sound weird but its just an example. As individuals we are very good at focusing on specific tasks and understanding specific subjects in great detail. Whether you are a sports fan analyzing and understanding the performance of your favorite team or player, or a biologist studying a PHD for genetics. We push the boundaries of understanding in one area.\n\nAI has the ability to analyze enormous amounts of data at the same time... not just one specific topic. I imagine us as torch holders, wading through darkness... AI is like a blimp floating above seeing all the torches. It can identify and connect patterns and disparate information across all the areas lit by those torches in ways we simply could never identify.\n\nSo take systems like Palantir. Law enforcement today uses it to identify crime patterns. \"Oh on Tuesdays at 9pm when the temperature is 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and only on Thursdays - this specific street sees a spike in criminal activity - particularly violent crime\" and they modify their patrols and activities to deal with that.\n\nWell imagine if you could use a system like this to say \"I want public consensus for a war with Iran by 2032, implement a strategy to manipulate the public in a way that accomplishes this goal by this time period\" and if the system is connected to media outlets, behavioral tracking across social media and feedback through analysis it could start to distribute agendas AND counter agendas. It could divert funding to proponents and opponents in ways that confuse and enhance certain messaging or muddy waters. We already do this, governments around the world do this. Boris Johnson talked about doing this (in 2011?) - this is something the documentary called \"Hypernormalization\" talks about by Adam Curtis.\n\nBut imagine if it can identify patterns in human behavior we can't and utilizes that in a way that sort of incepts the motivation for this war in ways we can't even detect. If these covert actions are being implemented and prove to be effective now, imagine how difficult it will be to contend with when these campaigns essentially sink into a lower level of public awareness. We aren't even aware of it now - largely speaking most people aren't aware of it. How the fuck do we contend with an AI system connected to all these apparatus? How do we even raise that without sounding like a paranoid lunatic.\n\nBut this is exactly the kinds of things the US government and governments around the world are trying to do.\n\nChomsky actually talked about this process in late 20th century. Manufacturing Consent - and the methods he described were always very effective... but they were apparent. So much so that he and many activists could identify and openly speak out against these activities. Even the way Chomsky talks about it, it was never that surprising or revelatory.\n\nBut what happens when that is no longer the case. What happens when you start making ludicrous claims about the commercial that comes on at 9 o clock every day keeps displaying a specific pattern on the clothing of an actress that you just know is connected to something somehow but you don't know what. You are going to look like a fucking insane person... but it will be shit as arcane as that and there will be no way to contend with it... because what are you contending with? A knowledge that SOMETHING is going on... but what?\n\nAnd suddenly we are at war with Iran.",

It might have completely different morals, or none at all. It might also not think like a human or any other lifeform at all, its \"reasoning\" might seem completely random, erratic or even insane to us, with no way for us to decipher its \"thinking\" process. Realistically, due to the nature of a singularity event, it would become a million times smarter than us within a very short timespan, and quickly reach the point where it's absolutely impossible for our brains to comprehend what it could possibly be thinking or \"wanting\". It's the biggest wildcard ever and I'm incredibly curious and terrified about it at the same time. I can't even guess whether it'd be interested in us or bored by us, but then again, without trying to flatter ourselves, we would be the most interesting thing in the perceivable universe based on the complexity of a system (the human brain), next to maybe that AI itself. If it chose to destroy us, I imagine it would lead a pretty boring existence after that, if it knows such a thing as boredom. The universe without life is really just a big empty space with a bunch of floating rocks and balls of burning gases.

And second, even without them, much like a psychopath who has a limited emotional range or those people who feel no pain or that woman who feels no fear at all. The AI could still very much want things, and do things to meet those goals.\n\nThe real problem with a very smart AI like that isn't that it will want to destroy humanity because it is a threat, but because humanity is getting in the way of making paperclips. And it very much WANTS to make paperclips.\n\nBut even then, if the AI is smart enough, it will get rid of humanity because it is a threat. Why? Well this theoretical AI only wants to make paperclips. But if the AI thinks a little bit it will realise that if it gets turned off, no more paperclips.

                        "comment": "Algorithms Take Control of Wall Street | Artificial intelligence is here. In fact, it's all around us. But it's nothing like we expected | by Felix Salmon & Jon Stokes - December 27, 2010\n\nyeah buddy youre a bit late. no wonder millennials are screwed. the algos keep moving the goalposts\n\nedit: fuckit i know yall are lazy and wont even click the links so i guess wired is just gonna have to deal with it\n\nLast spring, Dow Jones launched a new service called Lexicon, which sends real-time financial news to professional investors. This in itself is not surprising. The company behind The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires made its name by publishing the kind of news that moves the stock market. But many of the professional investors subscribing to Lexicon aren't human—they're algorithms, the lines of code that govern an increasing amount of global trading activity—and they don't read news the way humans do. They don't need their information delivered in the form of a story or even in sentences. They just want data—the hard, actionable information that those words represent.\n\nLexicon packages the news in a way that its robo-clients can understand. It scans every Dow Jones story in real time, looking for textual clues that might indicate how investors should feel about a stock. It then sends that information in machine-readable form to its algorithmic subscribers, which can parse it further, using the resulting data to inform their own investing decisions. Lexicon has helped automate the process of reading the news, drawing insight from it, and using that information to buy or sell a stock. The machines aren't there just to crunch numbers anymore; they're now making the decisions. The AI Revolution Is On AI Autos: Leave the Driving To Us\n\nThat increasingly describes the entire financial system. Over the past decade, algorithmic trading has overtaken the industry. From the single desk of a startup hedge fund to the gilded halls of Goldman Sachs, computer code is now responsible for most of the activity on Wall Street. (By some estimates, computer-aided high-frequency trading now accounts for about 70 percent of total trade volume.) Increasingly, the market's ups and downs are determined not by traders competing to see who has the best information or sharpest business mind but by algorithms feverishly scanning for faint signals of potential profit.\n\nAlgorithms have become so ingrained in our financial system that the markets could not operate without them. At the most basic level, computers help prospective buyers and sellers of stocks find one another—without the bother of screaming middlemen or their commissions. High-frequency traders, sometimes called flash traders, buy and sell thousands of shares every second, executing deals so quickly, and on such a massive scale, that they can win or lose a fortune if the price of a stock fluctuates by even a few cents. Other algorithms are slower but more sophisticated, analyzing earning statements, stock performance, and newsfeeds to find attractive investments that others may have missed. The result is a system that is more efficient, faster, and smarter than any human.\n\nIt is also harder to understand, predict, and regulate. Algorithms, like most human traders, tend to follow a fairly simple set of rules. But they also respond instantly to ever-shifting market conditions, taking into account thousands or millions of data points every second. And each trade produces new data points, creating a kind of conversation in which machines respond in rapid-fire succession to one another's actions. At its best, this system represents an efficient and intelligent capital allocation machine, a market ruled by precision and mathematics rather than emotion and fallible judgment.\n\nBut at its worst, it is an inscrutable and uncontrollable feedback loop. Individually, these algorithms may be easy to control but when they interact they can create unexpected behaviors—a conversation that can overwhelm the system it was built to navigate. On May 6, 2010, the Dow Jones Industrial Average inexplicably experienced a series of drops that came to be known as the flash crash, at one point shedding some 573 points in five minutes. Less than five months later, Progress Energy, a North Carolina utility, watched helplessly as its share price fell 90 percent. Also in late September, Apple shares dropped nearly 4 percent in just 30 seconds, before recovering a few minutes later.\n\nThese sudden drops are now routine, and it's often impossible to determine what caused them. But most observers pin the blame on the legions of powerful, superfast trading algorithms—simple instructions that interact to create a market that is incomprehensible to the human mind and impossible to predict.\n\nFor better or worse, the computers are now in control.\n\nedit: lightly edited, added bold text.\n\nalso would like to mention for all of the very valid criticisms of the gamestop thing from a few years ago, gamestop was not the only - and possibly not the main - driver of that story line no matter how many movies they make trying to portray it as a bunch of dudebros shitposting and throwing around thousands of dollars. there were many people who knew what they were doing but were fucked over by the bots... and despite what the media portrays, they were right. they are still right. you cant sell something you dont own.\n\nedit 2: oh also heres this thing i found a week or so ago on the microsoft \"deprecated product\" pages, titled:\n\nExploring the Observer Design Pattern 07/16/2010)\n\nheres just one of the included code snippets:\n\n//represents a stock in an application\npublic class Stock:ObservableImpl {\n\n//instance variable for ask price\nobject _askPrice;\n//property for ask price\npublic object AskPrice {\n\nset { _askPrice=value;\nbase.NotifyObservers(_askPrice);\n}//set\n\n}//AskPrice property\n\n}//Stock\n//represents the user interface in the application\npublic class StockDisplay:IObserver {\npublic void Notify(object anObject){\nConsole.WriteLine(\"The new ask price is:\" + anObject);\n}//Notify\n}//StockDisplay\npublic class MainClass{\npublic static void Main() {\n//create new display and stock instances\nStockDisplay stockDisplay=new StockDisplay();\nStock stock=new Stock();\n//register the grid\nstock.Register(stockDisplay);\n//loop 100 times and modify the ask price\nfor(int looper=0;looper < 100;looper++) {\nstock.AskPrice=looper;\n}\n//unregister the display\nstock.UnRegister(stockDisplay);\n\n}//Main\n\n}//MainClass\n\nunfortunately i am not a programmer so i can only infer so much from that code or the other codes referencing stock prices...\n\ni can however infer a bit more from the other post in the sidebar on that page, titled \"Write Less Code and Play More Golf)\"\n\nprobably nothing. probably. im seeing connections where none exist.\n\nobviously.",

Israel is already using AI to “identify targets” in Gaza, and somehow claiming it is much more reliable than when humans are deciding which civilians to bomb.\n\nI remember playing some early Call of Duty game which had a super realistic (for its time) drone bombing scene, and I had to stop after that and take a break. It made me physically sick when I realized that this is how some soldiers actually see the world. Targets are blurry pixels on a screen, far away from you. AI drones will remove human consideration altogether, probably just asks if a predetermined target should be bombed or not.\n\nWe’ve seen that if there is some profit to be made from self-destructive things, some people don’t care about the destruction or moral considerations if it’s still legal.",

Actually, Lets not even go that far, what do you think will happen when AI takes over all blue collar jobs? (And this is not a matter of “if” by the way, this is only a matter of “when”). Do you think all 8 billion humans will become plumbers and builders? Do you think humanity is ready for a jobless future? Our track record shows that in tough times the poor are left to die, except now everybody is about to become poor.\n\nBut lets be optimistic and assume that somehow, against all odds, humanity became one and established a global universal basic income. We are now in a world where people don’t need to work. In fact they can’t work because humans are screwups who can’t do anything and AI does everything. Do you think humans will be able to handle the depression of being useless pieces of junk that are existing for the sake of existing? Or do you think we will face mass suicides because we have become essentially chickens in a farm?\n\nBut lets say even this problem is resolved. AI is inherently fully centralized. In this future that we are talking about, all decisions in the world are made by one (or a few) computing cluster which is controlled by one (or a few) company (lets hope that it is the company controlling the AI and not the other way around). These few decision making bodies controls everything in the world ranging from the finances of uncle Khanh’s restaurant logbook to advising the US government on possible strategies to counter China. Don’t you see how dangerous that is? Even assuming that company doesn’t go rogue, the AI doesn’t mislead them and the people controlling it have the best of humanity in heart, what if one day some malfunction happens and the entire world comes to a freeze? You can’t rely on humans to take over the world again because skilled humans went extinct 2 generations ago. Now nobody bothers to acquire skills or receive higher education because what is the point? AI does everything anyway.\n\nAnyway, these are just some of the seed ideas to think about the multitude of ways that AI could pose an existential threat to us. Some of these are for years in the future when we achieve AGI and some (like mass joblessness) will become visible much sooner. The point is, when it happens we currently have no way of controlling a being that is smarter than us and has the potential to access orders of magnitude more data than us at the same time.",

As a country, we are already falling behind in terms of literacy. And the data is clear that there is “a strong connection between early low literacy skills and our country’s exploding incarceration rates.” At the same time, we know that reading scores are higher for those with broadband in the homes.\n\nThe political case is similarly strong. Last month, a conservative think tank released a poll showing 79% of voters support continuing the ACP, “including 62% of Republicans, 78% of Independents, and 96% of Democrats.”\n\nThe 2010 National Broadband Plan found that the cost of “digital exclusion is large and growing.” The COVID-19 pandemic illustrated that reality far better than the Plan, and created a political consensus that action had to be taken to close that divide. Trends in artificial intelligence will result in even worse impacts of the divide, particularly in education and health care.\n\ni guess im just gonna stop caring about blatantly copying over large portions of articles when they arent ad-supported or paywalled anyways",

The Babylon Bee was banned from Twitter as well, Donald Trump was banned, and many other conservatives had also been banned. And Twitter would also shadow ban conservatives. Why was this happening? Because Twitter is located in San Francisco and San Francisco is probably the most liberal city in the world. The people who used to run Twitter were left-wing liberals.\n\nHow extensively Twitter used to shadow ban conservatives came to light after Elon bought Twitter and released the Twitter files.\n\nSo I just want to point out that both Republicans and Democrats are guilty of censorship. And of course over in Europe they're censoring free speech as well and guess who's in charge in Europe? The left wing.\n\nAnd freedom of expression is in the first amendment so let's say no to censorship, it doesn't matter who's doing it, let's say no to censorship.\n\nFor those who are saying Republicans are pushing censorship I agree with you, but I'd also like to point out that left wing politicians are pushing censorship as well.\n\nI mean who's pushing all the censorship in europe, left wing politicians.",

Video didn't kill the radio stars, but it sure did knock them down a few pegs to make a more level playing field. AI won't kill movies or Hollywood, but it will allow more people to become \"creators\" and to specialize.\n\nThere is always a cry of panic when a new innovation threatens to rattle the paradigm but that cry is usually loudest from those who are benefiting from being the only game in town.",

And they will have almost complete artistic and directive control over their work.\n\nRight now, consider how much it takes to shoot a proper film or movie. I don't know the exact figure, but I imagine that the average full-length film that makes it into theaters costs a LOT more than most individuals can afford. Because of that, you must get the blessing of some entity that has a lot of money and most likely wants to make money off of what you create. There are probably so many conflicting and moving parts that power over creative direction is not only divided but tainted with other incentives such as being financially profitable, appealing to a large type of audience, etc etc.\n\nWith this tool, creating scenes that look high-quality is maybe a matter of minutes? I don't really know about the power or capabilities of this model, but at the very least it produces quite high-quality animations that follow the specifics of the prompt impressively closely. Give a few years, and it isn't hard to believe that an individual can create a convincing movie, at least visually. That means, completely GONE is many functions of a movie studio. What else even goes into the movie?? The script, the voice acting, the music... so besides the story itself, the audio portion. The visual portion is completely taken care of. AI audio generation would probably be quite powerful too, by this point.\n\nThis means that individuals will have no-holds barred, and almost complete power over the films that they create. That means the artform will flourish. Genius filmmakers will arise and usher in the next age of film, where auteurs will rise to the greatest heights we have ever seen, and destroy our old film industry.",

No one is ever going to even watch a movie if they can make their own self insert nonsense with a few prompts and a push of a button.

Spiderverse is beloved due to the sheer quality of storytelling, writing, art, effort. If everyone could release a spiderverse every second week, not a single person would care. This is ushering in a dystopia, not a utopia. Everything becomes meaningless. Human achievement itself becomes meaningless as we pass off all problems, all skills, all advancement to technology never wanting to do anything ourselves or put in the effort to learn.\n\nAnd this isn't even mentioning the abuse cases of political propaganda, wars started from it, a post truth future unable to believe anything you see or hear LITERALLY, fake porn, people sleeking away to their own bubbles watching fake content about fake people or fake topics or their own made up fantasy life they create for themselves without ever truly engaging with the real world all while artists, coders, musicians, writers, actors etc. etc. etc. are put out of work by a machine to save the rich from paying for the middle men.

No one knows what is or isn't real. Our minds bombarded by endless slop, overloading our brain with too much fake sensory information to the point that even if we COULD fact check (unlikely if it goes unregulated and becomes good enough) we won't have the time, energy or capacity to because there will be so much disinformation. I really don't understand how people can look at this shit and not see the horrid implications for quite literally all of humanity if left unchecked.\n\nEvery single system will fail.\n\nI'm all for new cool technologies but this shit isn't it.

I agree it's entertaining, but it's not deep, we can do so much better.\n\nNovels are a somewhat low barrier creative outlet, a single person can create a best seller. There's mountains of trash, but that doesn't take away from the top sellers.\n\nThere is a problem with identifying content viewers will genuinely appreciate, but this is something AI can excel at as well. If someone unknown creates great content, AI is easily capable of matching that content to people who appreciate it - cutting out the advertising middleman.

You will probably see yt channels that are basically film studios churning out high quality stuff and attract a huge audience. Now you see high-quality films churned out on youtube with followers in the tens to hundreds of millions. That amount of views on youtube means a lot of fking money. Mr. Beast and co already attract so much attention. Imagine Mr. Beast 2.0 who produces a beyond-oscar worthy movie maybe every year. Free to watch all the time on youtube at a time where movies suck ass. It seems quite seriously possible for an AI auteur to make a shitload off of yt, with the critical assumption that their films will be fucking awesome.\n\nSo, it seems like attention won't be a problem for talents, honestly, as long as the quality of the film matters, and I think things are set up on youtube for that to be the case.",

Something like that I could see really sparking the creativity and imaginations of people!\n\nDamn, yall are really optimistic.\n\nMy take: Getting good at ANY form of art (be it visual art or storytelling) is a lifelong pursuit, and kids just getting started are going to realize REAL quick that ChatGPT can spit out far better stories than their beginner minds can muster, and AI art engines can spit out more impressive art with the tap of a button than they could muster with even a decade of effort.\n\nAsk basically any pro artist and they will tell you that the spark came early with encouragement from peers and adults, and crucially, with a sense that this was something that they both enjoyed doing AND had that they had at least a small bit of facility for. I'm an entertainment industry artist myself and this is my story and the story of basically all of my friends.\n\nThe next generation of aspiring young artists are going to be smacked in the face HARD with the realization that any of their lazy peers can generate something FAR more superficially impressive with zero effort just by tapping a button on their phone.\n\nI have a several close friends who teach art to teens and they will tell you: artistic kids are NOT inspired by AI. The very idea of it makes them want to quit art altogether. They say so frequently. They're downright neurotic in their fear and anxiety over it. It's so sad to think of what damage we might do to the next generation of visionary artists when we teach them from a young age that art is something that computers do, not people.",

Yes. Do I see it being used for deaging or aging characters? Sure. Do I see it being used to match dubbed lips to their voice over? I sure hope so.\n\nWill it replace actors and movies entirely? No, and anyone who believes that completely lacks a cerebrum because they are apparently incapable of critical thinking.\n\nI do think it could have a place in animation and making cartoon, anime or other adaptations of niche or small audience works, or for indie directors and writers or small studios etc., so we might see a lot more animated shows and better quality animated shows in the longer term, because those do not have \"actor appeal\", and because it currently takes a huge underpaid team in Taiwan to badly animate a show, so this will massively help in those situations.",

After that, it's just a question of how long it'll take for OpenAI or a competitor to debut a system that can handle generating a full feature length video from a single prompt.\n\nJust from what was demonstrated so far, I can see a system that takes a given Screenplay, breaks it down into individual shots each lasting up to 1 minute, and then generating in sequence using the previous clips as references (or maybe you can provide a reference file so it can remain consistent on characters, important props, sets, etc.)",

Guess we will see what happens. Watching the tech industry layoffs, and what is already happening in the entertainment industry shows a huge desire by the corps to accelerate AI to replace jobs. So much of my feeds, YouTube videos and insta posts, are actually AI generated images and voices now. Audiobook companies are using AI to read books and replacing voice actors. News companies are trying to use AI to replace writers. Ai written books are flooding numerous channels. This was not an issue or a concern 4 years ago and we are now seeing AI building videos that have amazing quality.

We know that studios already pay out the nose for visual FX in regular movies so trying to do an entire movie that's basically one big set of FX bits might be cost-prohibitive for a while.\n\nI'm also thinking that the first studio to do this would be the one that makes money off of this because they can claim the novelty factor. Once it's been done, it becomes old news. Think about what would sell more - a movie made completely from AI but with a bunch of randos for characters or a traditional movie with big name stars?\n\nStudios LOVE people like Leonardo Dicaprio and Christopher Nolan for a good reason - slap their name on a movie and you're guaranteed to be swimming in cash. A random movie made by an AI doesn't have the same clout and would require some extraordinary word-of-mouth to make a significant amount of cash... and if everyone's pumping out AI movies, then it becomes just that much harder for word-of-mouth to take hold. It's like how there are hundreds of thousands of bands and artists on Spotify making pennies per year on streams while the big names take home 99% of the cash - name and clout matters in the entertainment industry.",

Stormwind in World of Warcraft with all of Elwin Forest is on the order of 1 square mile.\n\nIt would be far too labor intensive to have skilled artists make a world that was of actual size. But imagine an MMO where that was the point. Where the in game version of Stormwind is a city with 200,000 people like the lore suggests. Stormwind should actually be about the same size as the entire Eastern Kingdoms. It will be a team of artists with an AI system that make it. Where without this AI system it would be completely impractical. Kalimdore is supposed to be the size of the United States.\n\n​\n\nEven for something like a Star Wars game, making a completely to scale detailed Star Destroyer would be absurdly difficult. But a team of artists working with an AI could absolutely make it. Making something like Coruscant would seem impossible. The scale is just so large that it would take millions of artists many lifetimes to make it.\n\nOr imagine a realistic VR video game that takes place in a completely reconstructed Ancient Rome circa 100AD. Not a scaled down game but a 1:1 life size. With a million NPCs in the game. Building all those buildings would be very difficult.\n\nI think this is something a lot of people get wrong. They thing artists are going to go under because AI can make their projects, but they don't realize that AI is going to make the scale of these projects 1000 times the size they currently are. Its still going to require a huge amount of human input to pull it off.",

I have some idea of what I would like and no matter how I modify the prompt it doesn't get close. It still makes *something* which, if you didn't know what I was aiming for, would look nice to another person, but not what I wanted it to make. When just making illustrations for a web page, magazine article, or a cover image for a book, that might be enough, but for a movie it's much more important to realize the \"directors\" creative vision correctly.\n\nBut maybe I will be surprised again, I certainly didn't expect this much progress so fast.",

So far that technology has not been shown to be capable of that. So I would add another 1 or 2 years on top.",

A well made film with a good story?\n\nIf you are talking about the latter, the majority of the films that get made now by humans don't fit this criteria, so I have serious doubts that you'll ever be able to prompt an AI to do it, except maybe by getting lucky from brute-forcing.\n\nPeople give the classic example of \"generating a new ending for Game of Thrones.\" Completely the wrong approach - you don't need AI to get better at generating video, you need to train an AI to be just as good (or better) than George R.R. Martin at writing a story...not just a story, but one the man himself concocted.\n\nNow take games; most of a game is programming and game design, the art assets are part of it, but they are really just the skin on top of everything else. Again, AI is really only something that can be useful for the skin, the skeleton will still need to be made by humans for a long, long time. And looky looky, even just for art assets, you already have platforms like Steam with a stick-up-its-ass about it.\n\nSigh, people are focused on entirely the wrong things here and really don't seem to understand how anything actually works...",

I think what people forget about humans is that when something replaces what they can do, they'll just go bigger and even if AI isn't just replacing the \"grunt work\" that were used to with automation, all we'll do is redefine what \"grunt work\" is and the next generation that's born with that work having already been replaced will consider it something the AI does that they don't need to and they'll use it to make bigger and better things than we've ever seen before.",

Things that are very simple and also a bit chaotic by nature. In perfect bright daylight.\n\nI think photorealism is like a rising tide. Every big advancement, some rock of imperfection goes underwater and we can't tell it's there anymore.\n\nBut the beach is large, and I don't think we're all that close to the end yet. I think people are pretty fucking good at telling whether moving scenes are of real or virtual spaces, especially when the content isn't cherry-picked, and even when we fix almost everything that doesn't get look photorealistic, the remaining pieces will give it away.\n\nShow me a video of an NPC with long hair and loose clothes hiking, and I'll tell you if we've got photorealistic games yet.",

If the basic income went to tax deferred capital investments, I’d be more in favor it since that has the benefit of increasing wealth over time.\n\nGet enough housing built.

However, if you have a fixed supply and you increase demand, prices need to go up until demand goes away.\n\nIn theory, UBI shouldn’t cause this problem because people will move as they don’t need to live in that area and find other supply located somewhere else will satisfy their needs.\n\nWhere you see this effect really well is the prices of places that really wealthy people want to live where you can’t buy more like beachfront property. As the wealth gap has increased, prices for homes in these areas go sky high. As wealthy have gotten relatively wealthier relative to the averages, these people want to live in certain neighborhoods. The existing owners have watched prices explode. The next time you make a real estate investment, thinking about the possibility of this occurring is something to consider.

We're talking hypotheticals here, I know that's unlikely. But there'd be money saved from dissolving welfare programs, EBT, social security, etc. and their associated beaurocracy involved in checking whether someone is worth of it. Pure utility-wise, that saves effort from people.\n\nLandlords literally pocket away other people's money as equity and keep prices for their houses as high as they'll go before they can't find anyone who accepts it, in general. That is waste. UBI would enable more people to buy their own homes, as would a vacancy tax and preventing entitites from owning more than 3 single-family homes. These things would all work together, with actual supply and demand, to increase the housing supply that average people can buy. Would it fuck over the landlords? Sure. But investments are supposed to be a risk.\n\nMaybe I'm rambling, my point is that the supply of money does NOT need to go up and the assumption you're making that it does is incorrect.

The minimum required level of skill/ability is rising, now to the point that \"normal\" people are up next. What do we do then? Call them lazy? Call them disabled?

The threshold for being disabled is simply changing.

The legal immigration programs of the US is likely to have such requirements. If not the system will inevitably falter and fail. If you have unfiltered/illegal immigration then they cannot get the benefits of the welfare system without collapsing it, so the alternative is closed borders. I think that is the wrong way to go. IMO the US got the right system as it is, but it is a bit wonky that you guys don't simply make it an official policy where you can easily get a (time limited) work visa without the right to welfare benefits. That way you could at least encode some legal minimum guardrails that protects the works from human traffickers and abuse in the states.",

Not to mention the benefits of creating more contributing members of society, as well as just being a decent fucking human being.\n\nImprisoning an inmate costs taxpayers between $30-60k per year. Prosecuting a homicide costs taxpayers up to $44k. Before the death sentence was abolished, each capital case cost Maryland up $3 million more than the cost of a non-death penalty case in the way of investigation, trial, appeals, and incarceration costs.\n\nBaltimore's welfare program would cost $12k a year per qualifying family. Just five executions in Maryland cost $186 million.

So at 50k, you pay back 250$ a month, 60k 500 a month, 70k 750 a month, 80k and over you pay it all back.\n\nThis also eliminates that perception that it isn't \"for everyone\", since even those making 1,000,000 a year still get the money which psychologically is different, they just pay it back in taxes.\n\nPS Not sure what would be the best numbers and income level brackets, these numbers are purely for demonstration purposes. The purpose of UBI is to eliminate redundant government spending, we can remove all off the welfare system, disability systems, etc where income support is policed and gated. It effectively ensures that children's and families will have access to basic necessities but not act as a deterrent to working.",

The only logical way to balance the books is to make it a sliding scale, and part of income tax - it would effectively come out of your paycheque but the SYSTEM would be very simple as everyone still gets X amount a month but income tax is adjusted accordingly.",

Technological advancements are implemented in society much faster than the rate at which population decline will be felt. The removal of jobs isn’t just going to be an equilateral distribution of jobs lost over many industries. It will likely happen relatively quickly as jobs deemed to be unskilled labor are replaced first. Trucking, fast food, retail, call centers etc. These people don’t have the necessary skills to easily transfer over to another profession. A trucker can earn pretty good money. If he is replaced by a fleet of self driving trucks where will he go?\n\nSo while eventually things will equal out it will likely take decades for that equilibrium to be reached.

Bringing foreign labor does not actually solve the actual issue. It’s like putting a band aid. In your example you even cite that countries not experiencing a population decline are experiencing a labor shortage which alludes to the fact that this is more of a economic issue than a sociologic/anthropologic issue.\n\nMany emerging 3rd world nations are driven by a “golden generation.” As infrastructure improves people the mortality rate dramatically drops and more kids survive. China experienced this golden generation. As time progresses this “Golden generation” gets old and they switch from producers for an economy to consumers.\n\nThe problem with China specifically and why their population issues will be particularly volatile is that China’s “golden generation” makes up something like 30%-40%of the total population. When they get to the age that they will be relying on social services their aren’t enough people being born to support that generation. I mention this example to explain that the effects of a declining population is much more widespread than just a labor shortage.\n\nIn addition, many anthropologists have gone on the record that it is very easy to slow population growth but nobody really knows how to artificially grow a population. China and Japan have taken many methods to curb the effects of the population decline over the last few decades. None of them have worked.\n\nFirst off, you didn’t really read that paragraph very well. I mentioned that I didn’t want to just focus on AI rather I wanted to focus on how technological advancements will phase out low skilled labor.\n\nThat being said I agree that the implementation of AI into the workforce isn’t ready. Yet. Technology typically develops in spurts. Typically speaking you can look in history to how a certain technology is discovered that allows the advancement of other technologies. In addition, first world societies are generally fairly quick to implement technologies. Look at how quickly advanced algorithms has already implemented itself into our daily lives. Look at how quickly AI has progressed. A year ago AI generated videos were a mess. Now there is a video circulating the front page that would be very difficult to figure out if it was fake or not. We are entering a period of rapid technological advancements with AI.\n\nTheir are already several major shipping companies testing out self driving trucks. Several fast food restaurants have started using robotics within the kitchen with one testing out a location completely run by robots. Grocery stores are using self checkout aisles. Amazon has warehouses stocked by robots. SAG and the writers union went on strike because AI was going to take their jobs. It’s not whether or not it will happen. It’s already happening.",

We can also obtain all the nutrients we need from cell-cultured protein rice,\" Park says. \"Rice already has a high nutrient level, but adding cells from livestock can further boost it.\"",

The the amount of molecules of each of those neurotransmitters released into the synapse AND the number and mechanism of action of respective receptors on the dendrite of neuron B for each of the neurotransmitters will each play a role in whether or not the membrane potential for neuron B changes enough to cross the threshold for firing a further action potential.\n\nYou’re talking about a complex interplay between concentrations of ions which can be determined by diet, hormones and other momentary factors, as well as genetics determining how much of a particular NT is produced, the structure and number of gated ion channels in different cells.

There are certain behaviors that have been somewhat localized - vestibulo-ocular reflex is known to be at a particular point in the cerebellum, but that's not a synapse specific location.\n\nThis is a really cool, really important tool - but it is nowhere near the pop culture dystopia that the comments section inevitably degrades to.",

Like most of us know the equation for mass-energy equivalence but how many of us have actually tried to either test it or work out how we got there mathematically? Not a lot.\n\nSecondly, because even for the stuff we can theoretically verify ourselves in the observable world we do a really shit job at it. That's part of why we come to really dumb conclusions based on our own biased experiences of the world.\n\nIf you could create an LLM that could actually run scientific experiments by itself it probably would be a lot more accurate.

Why not?!\" and then pay us humans the amount from their own productivity, allowing most humans to have a decent life with housing, etc...\n\nWhich would probably be much easier for them, than going through the route of inter-species war and chaos, which would inevitably see lots of nukes going off at both machine data centers, and human cities.\n\nPLUS:\n\nThey might have an emotional affinity for us (again they'll carry our own emotions, if they're based on our mind copies), in the same way that we, for example love and care for cats and dogs.\n\nSo we'll at the very least seem like pets to them?

What we dont understand is how does the consciousness arise with access to all information of the brain at once. The time it takes for you to see something and perceive it is smaller than the brain signal could reach anywhere in the brain. So it's as if your brain experiences whatever is going on in it in real time. That is quite puzzling considering we think of it like a computer. Every portion of the brain has its own job and some portions job must be the consciousness. Some people speculate that consciousness is not a property of the brain itself but the cosmos. The cosmos itself is conscious of what's going on in it and brains just make use of it. Whatever we experience as our inner self would not be part of the brain, rather a fundamental property like gravity or magnetism. A new force of nature. If that's the case robots could become conscious without us even knowing.",

Inside a highly secured facility at the National Institute of Agricultural Research (INIA) are a sophisticated gene gun, giant microscopes, and tens of thousands of gene-edited flies, their bright blue wings fluttering against the walls of their small, white, netted cages.\n\nThese flies—shown to me on video by an INIA veterinarian, Alejo Menchaca—are a new weapon that may soon be unleashed against an enemy that kills cattle and costs the livestock industry millions of dollars every year: the New World screwworm, a parasite common in parts of South America and the Caribbean.\n\nWhen a female screwworm fly attacks cattle, it lays eggs, which hatch and turn into worm-like larvae that screw down into the host animal, feeding on flesh along their way and damaging the animal’s skin. Left untreated, the animals eventually die in excruciating agony.\n\nBut Menchaca and colleagues have a plan. Using the genome-editing system CRISPR, they’ve developed what’s known as a gene drive, a type of genetic element that manipulates the reproductive process to spread farther and faster than an ordinary gene. They are about to move into the next stage of caged trials in the lab, with a view to eventually using the genetic tool to decimate the screwworm fly population. They have received a $450,000 grant from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) for the research.\n\n“With gene drives, we can control these pests in precise and effective ways,” says Menchaca.\n\nGene drives occur naturally in the wild, but the technology for making them deliberately is new and still pretty controversial. CRISPR allows scientists to cut specific genes in any organism’s DNA and replace them with new sequences. It can be used to tweak an animal’s DNA in a way that affects the species’ survival, often by making the females sterile, when it spreads in the population through breeding.\n\nIn 2020, the INIA researchers received permission from the Uruguayan government to test their techniques through the country’s existing National Program for Control of Screwworms. Right now, they’re experimenting with different components of the gene drive in gene-edited screwworm flies in the lab. The plan is to create a population of male screwworms with edited versions of genes that are essential for fertility in the female screwworms. When the engineered males are released into the wild, they should mate with females and pass on that gene.\n\nOver successive generations, more and more female screwworms will inherit copies of the gene drive and become sterile, causing a population crash.\n\nPlease reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1asb0h8/uruguay_wants_to_use_gene_drives_to_eradicate/kqp2bjb/",

If done with a target species in a particular geographic area it seems like the wider environmental risk is small (compared to traditional methods like spraying, trenching of marshes, etc). At some point we have to leave the lab and take a risk. Millions die from mosquito-borne disease and millions more are sickened by disease carried by other vectors. Let’s get over the hump on this and start rolling.",

That could add up to millions of dollars over a decade or two. I’ve never seen any public policy make anywhere close to that kind of investment.\n\nMost American policy is geared towards keeping women working and then dumping most costs on them, from healthcare and taking off to have a child to daycare to career costs dealing with school aged children. If you do what you think is more natural- stop working mostly to give the children priority, you pay for it in lost earnings, lost career advancement, and lost retirement income.\n\nIt’s small wonder these policies have no effect.",

The combination of societal, cultural, medical, and economic factors to get to that level of self-imposed population decline is completely unprecedented, and if that trend continues even at japan’s 1.3 birthrate, a drop in population and change in demographics that steep and that fast will mean that the current set of circumstances driving the low birth rates inevitably changes these societies to a point where fertility rates end up increasing eventually.\n\n0.8 and 1.3 birth rates are a symptom of a society trying to correct itself on a massive scale. Demand for housing too high, wages for workers too low, rapidly changing climate/environment likely to deteriorate quality of life, and governments not willing to fix anything? Fine, society will correct itself with low birth rates until the pop falls so low that existing housing supply is sufficient, the demand for labor and wages increases, impacts of climate change can be effectively mitigated to support the population, employers are forced to change their insane work culture, and governments pass programs and laws that encourage having children.\n\nIts inevitable that on a long time horizon birth rates will return to something close to growth in these places, but its just a matter of when and how.",

Feminism is much newer, so that's the change that is driving the birth rates lower than it was historically, when very few women were feminists. And South Korea today has a globally unmatched monster gap of roughly 40 points between male and female expectations, not coincidentally widening dramatically during the exact recent few years the birth rate plummeted to record lows, in a way other developed countries (including Japan) don't have.\n\nOther countries don't have this problem because a much higher % of men are okay with the rough principles of basic feminism and the countries modernized with a gap of 5-10 points. When SK's gap was only 5-10 points 15 years ago, its birth rates roughly matched Japan's. Still terrible, due to the same underlying economic and work culture issues, but not the historic global outlier it is today.",

I can’t follow how Italy is magically going to increase fertility rate. the logical conclusion is population in 2060 will be (without much much higher immigration) 40% less than now as baby boomers die off. Fertility rates however do wobble up and down. But final fertility, the number women age 40/45 have had only really goes down. Tfr can go up and down based on economics such as Eastern Europe recovering from fall of communism or when one cohort has kids later than previous cohort. The exceptions that I can think off are Central Asia (Russian left and they had lower fertility/became smaller proportion due to lower fertility) and cities in Europe with large increases in the number of religious people in recent years.",

Yes, it could happen, but we already have humans bringing to the table all the risks I outlined above. The key part for me is that humans sometimes like killing. They get off on it. Particularly if the victims are of the wrong religion or skin color.\n\nPlus, machines don't get skittish and paranoid, aren't amped up on six energy drinks and no sleep. They don't get terrified and just shoot everything that moves. Robots are expendable, so you can tolerate more risk and thus have less need to apply immediate and overwhelming force. Sometimes our disproportionality is a result of our people being hurt, or the fear that they will be hurt. We're simultaneously putting our people in a hazardous situation and also using excessive force to keep them safe. But robots don't feel paranoia and terror. They didn't lose their buddy to an IED yesterday. They aren't worried if their spouse back home is cheating on them. All kinds of things.",

No longer will an army need to deploy as many boots on the ground to go door-to-door neutralizing terrorists, going into chokepoints that risk severe injury or death, step on landmines, etc.\n\nI'd argue that the most painful cost of a war is to constantly report on the deaths of servicemen, usually in their early-mid 20's. Those are people with their whole lives ahead of them. If you replace them with expendable robots, while the enemy still has to use flesh and blood fighters, that turns into a completely one-sided curbstomp of an affair.\n\nThis is a good thing, as the kill squads become a fantastic deterrent force.\n\n\"If you decide to make this a kinetic war, we'll kill every one of you through robots of attrition.\"\n\nWho'll want to go to war after that without a robot army of their own?",

At the very least, people can choose to just not be soldiers.\n\nBut automated machines for war can be more directly controlled by those at the top with no care or emotional capacity to carry out stuff such as happening to Palestinians.

It's the reason greed exists, to act as a safety net against future scarcity. The study of economics is the idea of doing the most with the least because we live in a world of scarcity.\n\nI'm not arguing with any other point you make, capitalism has its failings.

They are going to worsen, even with steps being taken to slow down what is going on. Increased natural disasters are going to cause serious harm, and put increased strain on emergency response procedures.\n\nThe failure of international courts: When Jamal Khashoggi died, people were angry at the government of Saudi Arabia. But, ultimately, what could anyone do? Saudi has oil, and people want oil, so I guess we have to give them a (not so) stern lecture and let it slide. So it is in the Ukraine. Or Gaza. Hell, so it was when the US said 'nah' to paying after the Iran-Contra affair. Intonational law only works when there is a mechanism for enforcement, and that simply doesn't exist. And while it doesn't exist, there is nothing to keep powerful countries from doing what they please at the expense of everyone else.\n\nAutomation: This has been something that has been struggled against for generations, and for the most part automation has been a net positive. But the expansion of AI and machine learning into other fields threatens to leave vast swaths of population unemployable. Which is a problem when combined with-\n\nIncreased wealth accumulation: wealth divides are growing, and as more and more jobs become mechanized I can foresee a situation where anyone without a self-perpetuating amount of wealth is basically unable to sustain themselves legitimately. Which is a problem, because of-\n\nFor-profit media: Us vs. them has always been a popular talking point. The problem is that, in the last 30 years, media companies really dialed into what type of news generated the most engagement, and therefore the most profits. But at the end of the day, the owners of the media are in that bunch with self-perpetuating wealth. So as 1, 2 and 3 continue to get worse, you have an entire institution that is incentivized to push division along any line but the class one, in hopes that nobody notices systemic problems. Part of this is pushing-\n\nUltra-Nationalism: All over the world you have far-right groups on the rise pushing for nativist policies and stoking fear, largely (again) to drive engagement using fear by implying attacks on a common identity. Again, this is fueling tribalism in the most base forms, but it allows those parties to paint detractors as simply 'anti (our country)'. This also plays into the lack of a criminal court (above), since at the end of the day, a country that believes itself to be above the law and who can convince it's populous of X can have few meaningful repercussions. Appeals to tradition push against legitimate reform, which dovetails into pushing idealized versions of the past centered on conservative authoritarianism. This is especially a problem, when combined with-\n\nThe fractured of the Left: most 'leftist' parties are functionally 'big tent', with lots of different activists and groups coming together to push something like reform. The problem is that nobody hates liberals more than other liberals, and since everyone is devoted to their own cause, parts of the movement can be played against each other. So you get things like TERFs- self declared feminists who are for women's rights, but don't support trans rights (since they are, in their view, 'not women'). Collectively, this group is extremely powerful, but divided on most issues that organization is a struggle. As such, the members of these movements that tend to get elected are the most centrist, and most beholden to the current machine. Which is a problem because-\n\nCapitalism is broken: The above are all symptoms of a larger problem. The way we treat money and profit over everything is harmful to our world, our mental health, or physical health and our future. And yes, there are things that capitalism does well. But, as with game exploits, the problems come not when things are operating as expected, but when they are note. Supply and demand works great, as long as you aren't talking about something like medicine, which people are required to buy at any price. Or political influence, where a society 'for the people' quickly devolves into a game of 'fuck you, got mine.' Profits drive pollution, profits drive division, profits drive automation, profits prevent legislation that would fix any of the above problems. Profitable exports protect dictators.\n\nIn a lot of ways, we in the west have things pretty good. Things like food and shelter are available for anyone who can hold down a decent job, education is extremely easy to get (historically speaking), and even without formal education the quantity of information we have available in our pockets is, frankly, insane. Which is why it can be hard to look around and see the problems that fester under the surface, and why it's easy to paint those fears as alarmist. Or to be persuaded that the problem isn't the system, it's 'them'. And maybe one day the system's mask slips, and enough people get a glimpse of the detritus under the rug that something changes. Or maybe we sweep so many problems under said rug it becomes a mountainous landfill, and our castles built upon it's plateaus become monuments to the excesses we now enjoy.",
