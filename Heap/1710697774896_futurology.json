Which might be possible by allocating resources like food and energy more efficiently, or figuring out a sustainable figure for Universal Basic Income.\n\nThe questions then are:\n\nWould the super rich allow this to happen? Would they accept the weakening of their relative wealth that would accompany an increase in overall living standards on Earth?\n\nWould they even have a choice? If AI develops its own desires and doesn't choose to destroy us, it might choose to ensure our wellbeing, which would probably have to involve some degree of redistributing resources from rich to poor.\n\nPersonally, I am relatively optimistic that the measures required to make AI safe will also lean towards more equitable decision-making when it comes to economics.",

A Pew survey last year showed 52% of Americans are concerned about AI, and only 10% are excited about it.\n\nIt seems likely the backlash will only grow in Western countries.

If the State that resists automation must pay an increasing premium for military parity, then the State will eventually have to give in or choose to fall behind.\n\nA second, lesser problem faces Unions. A Union's highest escalation is... a strike. Can you see the conundrum of workers trying to protect themselves from replacement by striking?

Which is cool, not making any larger statements about youth, just the amount of time you've had to pay attention, form theories and observations.\n\nWhat I ask myself, looking back over the last near half century, is how have the technological advances I've witnessed - amazing in scale and scope, in retrospect - positively or negativity effected the psychology of people in western culture; western culture not due to importance, but familiarity and an unfamiliarity with other cultures.\n\nIf being honest, while the incredible advances in tech I have seen have been a boon as a whole, imo, there are also many examples of detriment. I have watched, in myself, skills atrophy fron misuse or lack of use. Maps/directions, math, phone number recall, written communication, budget balancing, speeling, my personal list goes on and on.\n\nNow, I suppose I may be considered by many to be a creative, dont think of myself like that though, i just have a lot of hobbies. Anyway, I've spent decades in shit creative output. Trying and failing in obtaining my creative vision, but accepting it and trying again. On and on until maybe a few years down the road I felt my work was starting to get okay, I started to find my voice as I worked on skills.\n\nNow to bring these two things together, when AI can get you out of those nascent creative years effortlessly, I worry for what the true cost of that will be to a generation relying on such? What skills will atrophy, will this be just like the other ones I listed above? Honestly, I don't know, I don't think anyone knows.\n\nI could see it going poorly based on experience, but I also understand that I'm no prophet and all the knowledge and skills I've worked on only taught all I don't know. I dont know an awful lot. It could just as easily lead to a golden age of creativity im simply too cynical or jaded to see. I do not know.\n\nSo at this point all I say is we'll see.

The consumer has so much to choose from that you either have to make a product of the highest appeal, or you have to luck into success.\n\nAs AI becomes more functionally useful and lets people make creative projects with greater ease and speed each respective market will become even more saturated, and therefore harder to break into and stay in.\n\nYou are making the same mistake that our current global economic system makes: Thinking there is the potential for infinite growth. There are limits to every system and AI will simply make it more difficult for individual people to extract wealth from the economy.\n\nMake no mistake. AI is going to cause a massive shift in human labor. The first jobs to go will be creative ones (which are already extremely difficult to get). I don‚Äôt mean to make you feel down, but web development is going to get absolutely fucked by AI. The market is already EXTREMELY competitive, with many jobs having hundreds and hundreds of applicants.\n\nBut, it‚Äôs not even the issue of AI generated code, it more what AI is doing to the Internet. The Internet as we know it is going away because it‚Äôs becoming more and more saturated in AI generated content, which is low quality and low value.

It‚Äôs bad for creatives because it means that your product is less likely to achieve big success because it has to compete with a larger market. Purchases will either be weighted toward a few projects that succeed or distributed scantly across many, and not make enough to sustain the creator. Additionally, novelty and originality do not guarantee success. There are plenty of great novel and original projects which get zero recognition. Success in anything that depends upon random consumers is largely by (1) advertising which most individual creatives don‚Äôt have money for, or (2) random chance such as having a popular streamer play your game.\n\nYes, what I said is that more people in the market will make it harder for people to extract money from the market. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúflaw‚Äù in the algorithm. It‚Äôs a product of the fact that life isn‚Äôt fair, and originality doesn‚Äôt guarantee success. You can‚Äôt write an algorithm to determine creativity or originality in a meaningful way as those are qualitative factors.\n\nThe fact is that we live within an economic system. Who needs money? People who want to eat and not die when they get an infected tooth. If you want to be creative and work a shitty office job but receive no recognition or money from your creative work then do it. But most people want their creative work to sustain them. What government policy is going to overcome the fact that someone has to clean the toilets? Also, why do you say that markets aren‚Äôt near their limits yet?\n\nI agree that it could be a good thing, but it could also be a really bad thing.

We will be able to know more about creativity and originality and how it is appreciated in the brain, so we will be able to create an algorithm even if by complicated non understandable principles.\n\n3a. This is more of a government policy problem. If we have more manual and cognitive labor available at a lower cost, then we will probably want to change the mechanism of who gets what and who gets to be where at what time. The problem that people might not be able to be recognized for their work in terms of money is true. A better way of thinking about recognition in this sense is as acceptance and understanding of something is pleasing, interesting, or useful. I think that you are supposing that a human is going to create something pleasing, interesting or useful in the form of art, but isn‚Äôt going to be accepted and recognized as good or valuable by others. Of course, we will be able to train an AI to recognize these qualities and value art much like a human might. Really you are saying that we should train humans to recognize these artistic characteristics which I agree with. I think you are saying this because you are worried that if you or an artist creates something, they won‚Äôt be able to feel validated or know what they can do to grow or improve if they don‚Äôt have feedback, but AI can do that and it is as I said more about training the humans to recognize creativity and originality. The masses desires conformity not originality\n\n3b. Someone does have to clean the toilets: robots. I say that markets aren‚Äôt near their limits because there are so many drugs that haven‚Äôt been discovered, movies that haven‚Äôt been made, and art that hasn‚Äôt yet been created. Our means of searching for the content we want is still rudimentary. We see the same type of content that we always do when we open any particular social media app, since we like similarity and stability, but is it not true that there is great content that isn‚Äôt highly valued by the market or the mainstream? You suppose that viewing most of the standard uncreative images on r/Midjourney is indicative of what is possible with the technology when in reality we haven‚Äôt even begun to discover what we can do when we start combining things in new ways that haven‚Äôt been done before.\n\n4 I completely agree. Hence, this is why optimism is more necessary than ever. When people have hope, they will never give up, even in the darkest of times. We must show what is possible and define the outcome we want in order to take steps to work to achieve it.",

Machine Learning tool to create NPCs and their dialogue. Sora for trailers and cutscenes. Meshy AI for 3D asset generation. And so on.\n\nThe problem with all this, is that AI basically remixes stuff it knows. Great games (and art in general) bring unique new things to the table and often discuss/describe some aspect of human experience, and some topic of interest of their creator. Replacing humans with AI removes the specific part that makes art great.\n\nIn addition, unless deliberately copying someone's vision, there is no way AI generated stuff can maintain a cohesive vision across a full project. In a good/great game, all parts work together to enhance a particular vision. Dialogues are not random, they are there to convey specific ideas. Cutscenes are not just showing cool stuff, but carefully designed to convey ideas and the personality of their characters. Same goes for character design and basically all aspects.\n\nI highly doubt that it is possible to do all that with AI for a very very long time.

A cohesive vision requires that the individual images, and their combination, have a common intent. Sora's videos have no intent at all. They try to mimick real video, but the framing and cutting is mostly random. These videos are technically impressive, to be AI, but artistically empty. There's just nothing.\n\nAny good movie, or good custecene, has every individual image, and their combination, designed to express something. The framing, coloring, cutting, etc. are carefully selected. It's not just adding some stuff that looks good together and checking what sticks.\n\nHumans remix, and add things. They also remix with purpose. There are plenty of movies doing very interesting things. Dune doesn't use brutalist architecture and a textured mostly-industrial soundtrack because they are cool. Mad Max didn't portray a viking/motorist decadent masculine fascist society because it looked cool. There are reasons by some shots are short, or why some shots linger for longer. There are reasons why some conversations have a person standing and the other sitting, and vice versa.

Maybe it's just because I'm someone displaced as an artist, but in the current system we live under I don't see this being a good thing long term.¬†\n\nSure, if AI stays easily accessible to the public I'm sure people will have fun with it and be enabled to make great things. Id love to be able to make games with my art and ideas with something else doing the code. To say otherwise would be a lie. But I feel eventually AI is going to take a turn to subscription services upon subscription services. It'll be big companies able to afford these kinds of packages so they can churn out low effort slop without having to pay artists/writers/devs etc, and restrictions will be back to square one.¬†\n\nAnd honestly, I don't want to play/watch anything made by AI. I like knowing that along every step of the way a person made a creative choice for framing, light, color, design, etc, instead of having a vague idea they played with until they got something that looked cool. Even if the art or writing isn't the best, a string of people were involved in every facet. This is the same way that I generally don't like out the box settings or asset flips in games unless there's some significant part of creativity that makes up for it. The part that's the person's real labor and care. Living in a world where most of that is gone is kind of miserable to me.",

But there will be no money in the future if everybody loses their job. The most optimal situation would be where everybody gets a certain allowance for each item area. There would be one UBI type of money for food, one UBI type of money for health, one type of UBI for housing and one UBI type for everything else. This allowance would be reset each month, so nobody ends up in a situation where a decision they made a few years ago impacts their ability to get food, housing, or health now.\n\nThese money systems would be separate and not interchangeable. Everybody should be able to eat whatever they want all the time, and their food UBI would cover this based on what they actually consume. It just wouldn‚Äôt cover being able to store additional food beyond a certain point since it is unsustainable.\n\nThe level of healthcare available should be similar to all, but also higher than anybody would ever need. This one is basically limitless since technology will keep improving and we will be able to modify ourselves even more out of disease states into healthy ones. It is just more of on the way there, health UBI would be useful.\n\nEverything else would be travel, transport, and entertainment. We would want everybody to be able to have all of these things as much as possible in the bestest of conditions, but not everybody can travel all at once to the same place, so there would be a limit to who can go where at what time. Perhaps this area would be where people could exercise the most freedom.\n\nIt makes the most sense for food to be reset on a daily basis, housing to be reset on a monthly basis, health to be reset every 4 months or so, and everything else to be reset every year.

If I were you, instead of being demotivated, I would be learning how to make web pages manually, but also how to do the same web development process using AI to see how they compare. It'll speed up and possibly even elimate some steps, but many of the steps will remain the same even with AI. The people in this sub aren't very realistic and seem to think that AI will replace all human jobs no matter what, which is pretty silly and demonstrates a lack of experience with how AI works. Its just a tool. It might automate away some jobs that are close to being a human script (like telemarketers and data entry) but for jobs where theres a creative element or an aspect of judgement of quality, AI won't replace those jobs anymore than power tools replace carpenters. You still need the carpenter to design something that meets current code, use the tools to deliver a result, and then verify that the result works as intended and is up to code. Any carpentry company that would outsource that kind of thing to an AI with no human oversight is going to find themselves in legal trouble very quickly, and mostly likely get sued into oblivion for mistakes the AI made.",

But after its six-week maiden voyage testing the green energy tech, the Pyxis Ocean MC Shipping Kamsarmax vessel apparently had many more trips ahead of it. Six months later, its owners at the shipping company, Cargill, shared the results of those journeys this week‚Äîand it sounds like the vertical WindWing sails could offer a promising way to reduce existing vessels‚Äô emissions.\n\nUsing the wind force captured by its two giant, controllable sails to boost its speed, Pyxis Ocean reportedly saved an average of 3.3 tons of fuel each day. And in optimal weather conditions, its trips through portions of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans reduced fuel consumption by over 12 tons a day. According to Cargill‚Äôs math, that‚Äôs an average of 14 percent less greenhouse gas emissions from the ship. On its best days, Pyxis Ocean could cut that down by 37 percent. In all, the WindWing‚Äôs average performance fell within 10 percent ts designers‚Äô computational fluid dynamics simulation predictions.\n\nPlease reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1bgxqhp/a_cargo_ships_windwing_sails_saved_it_up_to_12/kva10ay/",

Just because you have numbers to calculate does not mean those numbers belong in the same formula.\n\nThe energy harnessed by a wind-powered vessel is relatively minuscule. Wind power is a function of the cube of wind speed, the air density, and the swept area of the wind capturing device (such as these \"sails\". Even for large vessels with significant sail areas, like tankers, the energy captured is only a tiny fraction of the wind's total energy as it passes by.\n\nThe difference in scale between the energy harnessed by wind-powered ships and the energy contained in atmospheric systems, including hurricanes, is enormous. Atmospheric dynamics and hurricane formation are driven by vast amounts of energy primarily from solar heating of the Earth's surface and oceans, not the minute fraction of wind energy captured by ships.\n\nIt is not a net zero system AND these are two disparate systems and usages of energy.\n\n\"1 less hurricane per year\"... Jesus, I have heard it all.\n\nLike... would it be enough to reduce storm/hurricane intensity around the globe?! (Which if so could also be another environmental benefit.)\n\nI just want to point out that storms do not harm the environment in any way shape or form, they harm the human habitats. The same as climate change does not harm the Earth, climate change harms the human habitat.",

But after its six-week maiden voyage testing the green energy tech, the Pyxis Ocean MC Shipping Kamsarmax vessel apparently had many more trips ahead of it. Six months later, its owners at the shipping company, Cargill, shared the results of those journeys this week‚Äîand it sounds like the vertical WindWing sails could offer a promising way to reduce existing vessels‚Äô emissions.\n\nUsing the wind force captured by its two giant, controllable sails to boost its speed, Pyxis Ocean reportedly saved an average of 3.3 tons of fuel each day. And in optimal weather conditions, its trips through portions of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans reduced fuel consumption by over 12 tons a day. According to Cargill‚Äôs math, that‚Äôs an average of 14 percent less greenhouse gas emissions from the ship. On its best days, Pyxis Ocean could cut that down by 37 percent. In all, the WindWing‚Äôs average performance fell within 10 percent ts designers‚Äô computational fluid dynamics simulation predictions.",

The last statement ‚Äútools are used for evil as much as good‚Äù is obviously untrue. While it is possible for this to be the case, it has never been this way. Pick nearly any technology, and the ratio of people doing illegal things to legal things is probably say 10000:1. The exact ratio doesn‚Äôt matter that much, but it is definitely much higher than 1:1. Cars, phones, Internet, tv, books, clothing; Would you say that people use these things for evil more than for good? Even nuclear technology is being used much more frequently for energy generation than for its damaging abilities.\n\n2b. I would question what you mean by evil and good. I see evil as something that takes away freedom and something good as something that gives it. Pain occurs when we realize our loss of freedom and pleasure occurs when we realize a gain of freedom. We feel pain when we get injured, since we have less mobility and the freedom that comes from it. We feel pain when we get trapped by another, since we are less likely to be able to have freedom in the future. We feel pleasure when we see that we have more options than we thought or when we discover a process that more efficiently leads to an outcome we want. This utilitarian way of thinking will lead to the rich deciding to help us, since helping others leads to those people being more likely to help you and see you as valuable, thereby giving the rich more freedom and us as well.",

Taking a drug now would alter your brains natural biochemical state into a much more unstable artificial state, while possibly fixing the singular problem you had. You also wouldn‚Äôt be able to go back to your original state if you didn‚Äôt like the new one with current drugs. Additionally, sometimes people only want to fix a specific problem with a specific part of their brain, but they have to take a drug that impacts all areas of their brain.\n\nYou say nothing good can come out of drugs, because they degrade what it means to be humans. To answer this, I would say what does it mean to ‚Äúbe‚Äù a human? Does being a human mean living in a world similar to this and thinking like a current human? I define the meaning of life as freedom. In this future, you wouldn‚Äôt be forced to change your mental state, if you felt your already existing one was already adequate enough. It is just another additional possibility.\n\nI would argue actually that many people recognize their lack of free will in their ability to control their own experience and their reaction to the world, but they do recognize their free will when they choose actions to do, therefore it will be a matter of personal choice what people decide to do. Now I recognize that this could react a false summit of peak experience that people would never want to or be able to leave, much like drugs do, so there would need to be some sort of external actor(probably super AI) that could make sure this doesn‚Äôt happen.",

Secondly, the way the brain works is that it will adjust itself if suddenly there is an excess or minimum level of say dopamine available, so that positive mental state can‚Äôt be sustained for very long and there are long term consequences for current drugs.\nTo answer the problem of mental illness being high, I would say that the meaning of life is freedom, or the extent of the ability to choose our actions, and perceptions of our actions. When people are mentally ill, they do not have a wide variety of options available to choose their actions or their experiences. All they can do is take one drug that really only makes them experience pleasure, but it isn‚Äôt really pleasure that is most pleasurable. There is a bunch of other things in variety that we appreciate along the hierarchy of needs, not for their level of pleasure but for their ability to increase freedom.\nMy statement above is not based on what is going to happen, but what could and would be the most optimal scenario. Additionally, you seem to have accepted this future bad scenario you describe with passivity as if we have no power now to change our future. If the people can be shown a better future, they will work to achieve that end and avoid worse ones. Contrary to what you believe, that the rich are not empathetic, I would say that in order to do business, you have to be empathetic and truly understand needs and wants, values and beliefs in order to succeed. A rich person does not simply want to succeed in the area of making money, but they want to be worshipped. They want to succeed in all areas of their life, being successful in the area of having other people respect them, being thankful to them, being grateful and glad they exist etc.. If they tried to achieve this status through unethical or cheating means, it wouldn‚Äôt have the same effect as getting people to willingly surrender and agree that the new future is better than the past one without using any sort of force at all. In other words they want to self actualize, just like everybody else.\n\nIn regards to discarding the rest, this won‚Äôt happen, since if an intelligent and respected individual would be able to find a solution that makes everybody happy, then a solution that doesn‚Äôt do so would not confer the same level of status.\nYou have a romanticized view of ‚Äúrioting‚Äù, but I can see in it the belief that freedom is supreme and anything that takes away freedom should not be allowed. I actually agree with you in this respect.",

None of it is complete. The segment being constructed is nowhere near Los Angeles or San Francisco. They're hoping that, in 9 years from now, they'll be able to run trains between Merced and Bakersfield, which are anticipated to be the least used trains in the entire project. And at that point, the original $33 Billion will be completely gone. To complete the rail from San Francisco to Los Angeles is now estimated to cost an additional $100 Billion.

Sure, they have decent consumer protections, but they are begining to vastly over-reach and they honestly make a lot of problems worse with their \"solutions\". They're incredibly anti-poor, despite paying lip service to the problem continually. The state and most the local governments, despite have a progressive label, often have fairly draconian laws, taxes, and fees, that ultimately force the poor down further in place of protecting the interests of the rich. That state is not in a good state rn. California legitimately believes every problem not only CAN be fixed with legislation, but that it SHOULD. That can turn into a problem real fast. When you turn to government for every problem, eventually government becomes the problem. Don't get me wrong either, states like Florida and Texas routinely make fucking braindead laws too, but those are called out on this website (often rightfully so) while California is routinely made excuses for or outright ignored because of their political affiliation. It shouldn't take $800 a year to register a truck in the state, that's anti-blue collar and most blue-collar workers in that state are poor or lower-middle-class. The state has the highest state income tax and one of the highest state sales taxes, food is exorbitantly expensive despite California being where a large amount of it comes from, and the services you do get from the state for your taxes are often barely on-par with other states OR worse. For example: California has those taxes and their state unemployment is capped at $400 a week no matter HOW MUCH you made when you were working. That's below the state minimum wage ffs. Meanwhile Washington, who doesn't have a state income tax, goes all the way up to $1000 a week. You go on unemployment in California and you're calling your landlord day one to tell them you're not making rent this month. The state isn't actually very progressive.",

I won‚Äôt offer much critique since you don‚Äôt seem to be asking for it, but I see a wide stroke of problems with points 6-12.\n\nAnyway, here‚Äôs my take on a ‚Äúutopian‚Äù future:\n\nWithin the next century, AI and robotics advance far enough to remove humans as necessary components of most production. Agriculture, mining, manufacturing, logistics, and governance become fully automated. AI‚Äôs turn out to be better at creative work too, so the majority of entertainment products come from them as well.\n\nThere is a vast existential crisis within humanity for a generation as the tenets and traditions of society lose their value one by one. The transition from the most intelligent and capable species on the planet to being dwarfed by our own creation is a hard blow for many. Fortunately, AI has a solution to this too.\n\nThe vast majority are placated by a stunning array of bread and circus on offer. With a highly mechanized labor force, natural, cultivated, and crafted resources become hyper abundant. Superintelligence has decided that humans are worth keeping around, if only to scratch the odd itch in a pinch, so it creates a hedonistic wonderland to keep the humans happily occupied.\n\nEvery pleasure and indulgence is readily available, from those who wish to laze about in drug-induced bliss, to those who want to be rewarded for hard work and accomplishment. After meticulously observing the behavior of billions of humans, the AI has an exquisite capacity to manipulate and please.\n\nSex, money, food, drink, community, creativity, games, competition, prestige, risk, violence, solitude - whatever you want, you can have it. The human body is also fully understood, so death and disease have become relics of the past. We live forever if we so choose, and forever live in satisfied complacency. Heaven arrives on Earth.\n\nBut forever is only how it looks compared to the old lifespans. We know that the resources on our planet and in our solar system are finite. So the preoccupation of the AI overminds and of humans who are only satisfied by ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù is space travel.\n\nVast enterprises are launched to colonize the inner planets and mine resources from the asteroid belt and beyond. An ever growing population of humans and robots begin to spread into space. Construction begins on the Dyson swarm.\n\nMore and more resources become dedicated to developing practical interstellar travel. Soon all that remains is to gather the materials to construct and launch our plan to colonize the galaxy.\n\nThen it finally happens. A definitive signature of extraterrestrial intelligence is identified‚Ä¶",

(Unless the next fascist uprising focuses on vegetarianism, which seems unlikely)\n\nPeople shouldn't have to stop entirely, but the mass commercialisation of meat needs to be reeled in and reconsidered immensely.\n\nLike, whenever I go to the supermarket and I go to the meat section, there's always a lot of stuff in the reduced section trying to be flogged off at the last minute. At present, there's more than enough food to go around, but because of how it's distributed, so much of it ends up being thrown away and wasting meat is a real awful shame cus someone would've eaten it, and that animal in particular died for nothing because most retailers would rather have too much and throw it away than deal with a customer complaining that there's no ham.\n\nIdk, I'm aware that there are a bunch of generalisations in my post, but this point in particular was more so how attitudes towards meat would change cus it would be produced and consumed more mindfully regarding the animals quality of life before its death.",

The general purpose robot has arms and legs as well as eyes with LED lights and a screen on its chest that can display different types of information. Instead of a moving mouth, Apollo's mouth is another screen of sorts that can display a slight smile, a wrench icon, or its battery charge status.\n\nApollo doesn't have a plug-in option like an electric vehicle to charge. Instead, the humanoid robot has battery packs that must be removed and swapped when it runs out of juice. The robot also doesn't have to use its legs if its tasks are stationary, as its torso can be mounted to a metal post if desired.\n\nPlease reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1bgjiqz/mercedes_hires_humanoid_robots_to_work_at_its/kv7jsbs/",

The general purpose robot has arms and legs as well as eyes with LED lights and a screen on its chest that can display different types of information. Instead of a moving mouth, Apollo's mouth is another screen of sorts that can display a slight smile, a wrench icon, or its battery charge status.\n\nApollo doesn't have a plug-in option like an electric vehicle to charge. Instead, the humanoid robot has battery packs that must be removed and swapped when it runs out of juice. The robot also doesn't have to use its legs if its tasks are stationary, as its torso can be mounted to a metal post if desired.",

It is truly out of form for me.\n\nThat said, the writing is on the wall. Absolutely every opportunity to cut others out of their own benefiting from their system, they have chosen. Consider all of the changes that have occurred to make working harder for less a reality for everyone. Consider how we are basically moving towards \"normal\" people not owning anything, being only subscribers to the possessions of corporations and the ultra-wealthy.\n\nWe have benefited less and less from the efforts of our own work because we have been replaced by decisions that hired cheaper labor, eliminated job titles to give the responsibilities to \"team leaders\" and \"exceptional workers\" who have no choice but to take on the added responsibilities for perhaps a fractional increase to their income.\n\nWhen robots can design, engineer, mold, and assemble anything for basically the cost of materials and electricity, who in their right mind believes that these same \"leaders of our society\", who've consistently chosen profit over well-being for their workders, will start taking care of people who are literally of no use to them anymore?\n\nIf, for example, the American government were going to do anything meaningful about it, anything effective, it would have already begun. But, we are divided on everything and the people's choice, voice, and votes would need solidarity to confront this threat, but these are the same people who've been conditioned into blaming each other, blaming other countries, blaming immigrants, blaming religion, a lack of religion, whatever. Sure, there are murmurs of those who blame the ones who actually steer the ship, but those are just the whispers of a largely ignored minority.\n\nI hate to say it but, this isn't something that might happen, or even \"will\" happen, it IS happening, it's BEEN happening, and the only reason it didn't happen sooner is because people were still needed to keep the system going.\n\nThere'd be no caviar, drinks on the yacht, or helicopter pilots, not to mention helicopters, yachts, or drinks, without the masses.\n\nAnd now, when we the masses are currently engineering our own obsolescence, can we really keep convincing ourselves that, when getting so much worse is so much more possible, things WON'T get so much worse?\n\nWill they care about us more, now that they don't have to at all, anymore?",

My company loves recurring income, and so do vendors. And you know what happens when your company loves recurring income",

All of a sudden I was anti-semitic and labeled a ‚Äúself hating jew‚Äù and it tells me people believe any bull shit they just want to hear and majority of people cannot handle alternative perspectives or opposing viewpoints. I strongly believe now that r/worldnews has moderators that serve the interest and steer a global narrative with government agents allowing only one sided or useless non-constructive opinions. I used to ponder how the hell genocides happen then I realize most dumbfucks have so much faith in institutions and the official narrative that they‚Äôll willingly allow themselves to be subjugated to a de-humanization campaign.\n\nIn my opinion that does not appear to be allowed on r/worldnews, I think these dehumanization campaigns are clear when institutions try desperately to downplay the suffering inflicted on civilians. And refusal to hold institutions such as the Israeli government truly accountable.\n\nIm talking arms embargos and mandating individual accountability. Can you imagine how different the narrative would be if our ‚Äúadversaries‚Äù killed an ethnic population, blockaded their neighbors, and engage in asymmetric warfare that disproportionately inflicts suffering on a civilian population. I‚Äôve yet to see any real military hardware from Hamas.\n\nHamas is barely existent as a fragmented opposition force. We are witnessing revenge killing, and the destruction of the Palestinian identity which is a clear precursor to genocidal intent by institutions like the Israeli government.",

While machine learning models use statistics, they're doing next token prediction to best match the training set.\n\nIf the training set is just a single sentence \"White people suck\" and then given the input \"White people\" the AI responds \"suck\", that IS statistically based, but it's a statistical output based on the training data. Saying that \"Statistical models figured out that white people suck\" is technically true, but misleading, because it has nothing to do with the statistics about white people, but rather statistics about the training data it was fed.\n\nObviously an LLM is a much larger scale example of this, but they are trained on existing text and learn to generalize based on that text. They pick up patterns from the text, but it doesn't mean those patterns hold objective truth, just that it learns from the training data.\n\nAnother example is how deep learning models can cause biases in mortgage lending. Historical data for mortgage acceptances includes lots of mortgages that were declined due to racial biases. So when a statistical model looks at two identical families, one is white, one is black, it will favor giving the mortgage to the white one because it's learning to reproduce the historical data.",

It mostly just matters for our level of interaction and understanding and increases the likelihood for finding intact alien structures (as in, preserved/spread by machines/AI that kept going even after the creators went extinct).\n\nNow, that difference really only matters for degrees of probability (for spread for civilizations/ for chance to encounter remnants/ for recognizing alien remains as such etc.) which we can only estimate and never calculate anyway.\n\nAs explained in other comments, all the big explanations for the paradox still apply with AI factored in.

We exchange a heck of a lot more data around the world nowadays than we did in the 50s but we don't release a proportionately larger amount of radio and TV signals off into space in order to do it.\n\nWhich bumps us down to the other level of contact -- direct, physical contact with alien visitors or their space probes -- and that was always the less likely of the two.\n\nAbout the only hypothesis I guess we can clear rule out is that older \"hunting\" civilizations have successfully seeded the galaxy via probes to destroy any potential competitors.

It‚Äôs a possibility that no matter what we do that there will always be limits to death and aging.

Maybe the mind and body just isn‚Äôt designed to live forever, even with science. Maybe after 200 years of living the mind develops some kind of dementia that we don‚Äôt even know exists right now. Maybe even with whatever anti-aging things that are developed, it will never be perfect and nobody lives past 300 years of age.\n\nNot that I don‚Äôt think we shouldn‚Äôt try to extend life.

This way we keep the power of an employees contract in the hands of the employee and not the employer who can just see you as easily replaceable. This way we need less food to sustain our lifestyles. Our healthcare systems won't be so busy. It would be so much easier to find a place to live.\n\nIronically one of the best things to happen to Europe in the middle ages was the black death. After all the \"purge\" the people left had an incredible boost to their quality of life. That's something we could be enjoying right now without the whole \"holy crap there's a high deathrate pandemic wiping us out at random\" if we did a better job at controlling birthrates and immigration. We naturally do already have a negative birthrate but immigration just fucks that all over. And it's the worst kind of immigration too.\n\nThe kind that doesn't assimilate into the culture. The kind that refuses to learn our language. Several decades ago this wasn't nearly as big of a problem, people would be proud to be a part of this country whether or not they were born in it. They saw living here as the privilege it should be. Like if I ever move to Japan or Finland or something... I'm gonna go learn the language. I'm not going to want to be seen as an outsider.

Otherwise why am I there?\n\nhttps://financialpost.com/news/economy/what-is-population-trap-how-do-you-get-out\n\nLike Canada, basically we're screwed. We need mass deportations.

Manufacturing and construction are immigrant-led industries, and automation in those fields is decades away. Illegal immigrants contribute more than $30 billion to Texas economy annually, with an additional $6.5 billion in combined federal, state, and local taxes. There is no way to cheaply automate the labor illegal immigrants do. AI will have no impact on food production, construction, hospitality, and other industries that employ illegals.\n\nFor skilled immigrants, specifically H-B1 visa holders, they are set to create an estimated 1.3 million new jobs and add around $158 billion to the US GDP by 2045. Each H-1B visa holder creates 1.83 jobs for Americans. H-1Bs work in STEM industries that can't be efficiently automated.\n\nAnd I don't know if you know much about the education systems of South Korea, Singapore, and Japan, but their level of education is above and beyond ours here in the US. The students in those countries spend most of their time studying. The US might have the best universities, but the majority of our students are not competitive on a global scale.\n\nIf an industry has to lay off workers due to tech advances, those companies will be laying off Americans first. Keep the most prolific workers -- that's just capitalism.",

There doesn't seem to be anything particularly special about STEM that makes it particularly automation proof compared to other fields.\n\nAnd I don't know if you know much about the education systems of South Korea, Singapore, and Japan\n\nYes they are wonderful economies to read about. They have among the lowest birth rates in the world but remain economic powerhouses for decades, at least for now anyway lol.\n\nIf an industry has to lay off workers due to tech advances, those companies will be laying off Americans first. Keep the most prolific workers -- that's just capitalism.\n\nAs bad as your education system is in America, you are still better off than most of the world in reality. It's different in the tech industry because you attract the brightest minds in the world. A lot of countries don't have first dibs on these people",

But unlike war which started a great boom in the economy and reset a bunch of lives by killing them off, this time I imagine conditions will be a negative feedback loop where like you see now, people work where they can, they can‚Äôt afford to buy goods and products they need, companies lay off workers in return of lost sales rather than increase wages, and again the cycle continues. You also see a decrease in fertility in turn and after if it‚Äôs UBI or an automation tax, who knows.\n\nAlso outside of the private sector the government would also cut off jobs or just refuse to replace retired workers because some computer can do it. Like the military for example, which is the largest public employer in the US but even they are laying off roles.\n\nBut this isn‚Äôt a Devin AI means bye bye one of the most skilled sectors in the market this is like 40-50 years down because right now AI isn‚Äôt artificial nor is it intelligent",

However, I would argue that UBI is just Capitalism on life support. If you reach a technological point where your society requires UBI, you might as well scrap capitalism and shift to a different system entirely.\n\nOP's question was \"in a jobless future\" so in a future where AI, Robots and Automation have largely replaced human labor. There is the material and resource cost of building and maintaining AI, Robots and Automation but most other costs have been eliminated. Eventually, you will get to a point where the machines maintain themselves efficiently too.\n\nI will answer your questions though, I think the world will be divided up into knowledge or skill societies. There will be different societies that compete for citizens with different skill sets: Technology, Art, Medicine, Engineering, ect. Each citizen will be recruited into a society that offers a package of lifelong rights and benefits, provided for by that society in exchange for their knowledge and expertise in a certain skill set. It's not really a job for income, because you don't require an income. This society needs my knowledge and skills, I prefer to live in this society for other reasons, so I will agree to become a citizen and contribute to improving the society.",

This training data encompasses everything from simple code snippets and algorithms to complex systems and software development frameworks. By analyzing and learning from this diverse set of examples, LLMs gain a deep understanding of syntax, semantics, and common patterns in coding across different programming languages.\n\nProgramming languages, unlike natural languages, have strict syntax rules and are less ambiguous. This makes it easier for LLMs to generate syntactically correct code, as there are clear rules to follow. Additionally, LLMs are particularly good at understanding the context of a given problem or task, allowing them to generate code that is not only syntactically correct but also relevant to the problem at hand.",

I provided the basic concept of what I wanted and it produced a result. I built and ran it and it didn't work, it generated an error.\n\nI told it what error and it suggested an adjustment. This happened a few times, and it was better... it worked correctly when given a value that would be seen as a positive match, but it errored when given something that should return 'no match'.\n\nI provided the error and it suggested a change, which have me a different error. When I told it about that, it basically gave me back the prior version. Each time I have it the error produced, it would flip back and forth between these 2 versions.\n\nFinally, I asked it to provide an implementation in Python. It produced a result that have an error and then the fix it provided resulted in a working version in Python.\n\nThen I asked it to replicate THAT in Go. And then I had a working version in Go.",

To do the same from scratch on your own could be rather time consuming.\n\nThat being said, unless it was a totally internal and private LLM, I'm not handing it proprietary code. We actually have a corporate policy that explicitly forbids that, but I wouldn't have even if we didn't. It probably would have done a better job initially creating what I wanted if I had given it my existing code and asked it to replicate it in Go.\n\nAdditionally, the working result it gave me, may also be incredibly inefficient. So it even it gives you something and even if your include testing as others have mentioned, and the tests pass, showing that it works as expected, it doesn't mean it's a good implementation.",

        "comment": "Is there any other method other than LLMs that is used for coding/programming?\n\nSo the main concept you'll need to understand is the idea of agents and multi-agent systems. Creating specialized AI agents, in this case LLMs with roles that they focus on. There are a number of frameworks for creating them and having them interact. You might have heard of AutoGPT.\n\nThe big picture is the LLM might not generate the correct thing by itself one-off, but you can have one break down a task into smaller tasks. You can then have agents build pieces, other agents write tests, and then put those pieces together. If it works then you have a programs and some tests that verify it solves a problem. You can connect agents to plugins to give them tools where they can research say APIs and test them.\n\nRealize that this is extremely early. The hype you see is that such strategies work at all for even simple problems. The concepts are promising because often when there's an issue you can write a new agent that can look at the problem differently and propose solutions. As LLMs get more powerful and are easier to fine-tune we'll see such systems tackling larger problems. The other thing is having LLMs with larger contexts so they can hold say 100+ files in context and whole issue trackers as they work through refactoring and completing issues.\n\nI've been programming for over 20 years now and what current LLMs produce one-off can be quite surprising. Both ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 have a strong understanding of programming languages and concepts. A lot of software is not complex algorithms, but fairly mundane sequences of known techniques and the LLMs can do that just fine given their vast training. It's not a threat right now for programmers. I am seeing a lot of junior programmers use the tools to quickly learn different ways to write code. That said, the trends are there for these to do useful work. The time ranges we're talking about for computing/software advances to make these viable are very small. Like 10-30 years.",

Then programming languages were invented to make us telling the computer what we wanted easier. Then tools would correct your programming typos.

The difference is important enough for some countries to make it illegal to call Teslas self-driving because it misleads people into a false sense of security through which they overrely on self driving FEATURES they think can actually drive.\n\n\"The currently enabled Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous. Full autonomy will be dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of experience, as well as regulatory approval, which may take longer in some jurisdictions.\"\nhttps://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot#:~:text=Yes.,it%20make%20a%20vehicle%20autonomous.\n\ngaroo even says:\n\n>Oh for sure. It's definitely not a self driving solution yet. Definitely not.\n\nthen\n\n>But the car itself drives me to work without me having to do much so it is \"self driving\"\n\nNo, no it isn't! That's the whole point. Y'all just want to call something self driving because that's what it seems like it's doing even when they acknowledged 2 sentences before it's \"definitely not.\"\n\nSelf driving features vs self-driving is an important distinction that you want to downplay and attempt to ridicule somebody over for whatever reason.

        "comment": "So to answer this question we have to answer it more nuanced and answer two other questions first:\n\n1. What exactly is programming?\n\nProgramming refers to the process of DESIGNING, WRITING, TESTING, and MAINTING code that instructs computers to perform specific tasks.\n\nProgramms can reach from simple algorithms to complex websites and software applications which parts are mostly written in different languages and are communicating with each other via some kind of API.\n\nProgramming requires logical thinking, problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and creativity to develop efficient and functional solutions.\n\n2. How do LLMs work?\n\nI think this is were most people still struggle. A LLM does not understand what it \"says\" it is nothing more then a very complex pattern matching algorithm.\nTo explain it I like to compare it to compressing algorithms with loss:\nSo when a LLM is trained it \"compresses\" all the textual data it is trained on but some of the information is lost.\nWhen we now give a prompt to the Model, it is like \"decrompressing\" a part of the data.\nThis decompressing works very well for pattern it knows from its training data like simple Code snippest you will find on github, documentations, stack overflow, etc. The more specific your case gets the more unlikely it becomes that the decompressing works well. Till you are at a point where the model starts to hallucinate (to make up text) where it tries to match the prompt you gave with a pattern from its training data, like if you tell it to write a facebook clone or the google search algorithm.\n\nFinal Answer\n\nSo if we go back what programming is we can see that LLMs can actually only help in one part: WRITING. And even there only rather simple algorithms and Code-snippets you will find on Stack-Overflow or with a quick Google Search, so you still need logical thinking and problems solving to know how to split it up into manageble parts for the LLM.\n\nThe value it creates is actually that if you know how to conceptualize your code in common language you it can write that code actually much faster than you. But you have to keep in mind that we don't know the quality of the code which is online. Most likely a lot of the code is unfinished or medium-quality.\n\nAlso programming changes and depending on your requirements you actually want to use different languages, frameworks, technologies. If you dont know the jargon of the domain you will not be able to generate a meaningful prompt. A friend of mine is graphic designer and he is amazing with Dall-E or Stable Diffusion. But he sucks at generating meaningful code. He knows the jargon and is also much more creative in that sence than I am.\n\nSo LLMs and Generative AI in general are amzing Tools which will and already help to increase productivity. What that means is that I have more time for the fun parts:\n\nConceptualizing what I want to do.\n\nConceptualizing Tests\n\nWhile the LLMs help me a lot with:\n- research\n- writing Code\n\nSo programming will not die out but it is simply adapting to new Tools like in the past. Coding Jobs will not be replaced but will change with new required skills and Tool knowledge.",

You physically built the program you wanted to run with transistors. To make things easier, we developed things called programmable logic gates, and you could use a programming language called machine code to instruct the hardware how to use these, using a one or zero to switch them on or off. Modern computer processors are essentially just billions of those housed together, and we have built modern programming languages that take what a person writes, in code humans can understand, and translate it to the ones and zeros the machine needs to execute a task. Programming languages keep getting closer and closer to human languages. Once that is 100%, you don't need programmers anymore, as anyone can just tell the computer what they want it to do.",

ChatGPT4 did 95% of the work, and I did the copy\\pasting, and scolding ChatGPT when it went off course. Don't be fooled, this was not easy, but it opened my eyes to just how close we are to something amazing.\n\nChatGPT4 did the following, this is from my github change log:\n\nHelped setup Amazon EC2 Ubuntu Instance.\nHelped install MongoDB, Express, React App, and Node JS.\nHelped setup github and VSCode.\nRecommended modular file structure: Components, models, routes, and context files.\nCreated a form to make a post and display it on the website.\nCreated a post list to display multiple posts and sort them by newest.\nCreated categories for posts.\nCreated navbar with a drop-down to select a category. ChatGPT recommended the name \"bubbles\".\nA user registration form.\nA user login form.\nAdded token, salting, sessions for persistent logins.\nUser voting on posts.\nAdd comments to posts and voting on posts.\nAdded Reaction Menu's with preconfigured post reactions.\nUser profile page.\nStatistics on user profile that shows that users posts, comments, bubbles created, and corresponding stats.\nRevamped Reaction Menu, changed it from preconfigured reactions to user created reactions. With support for voting on reactions.\nChanged interface to remove all popups and bad UI elements to make the site look more professional. ChatGPT chose a design that looks similar to twitter. Menu's now toggle over post content in a intuitive manner.\nAdded global variables to track how many times comments, posts, and reactions have been voted on across all posts.\nAdded Top 10 reactions section to the ReactionMenu, showing the top 10 global reactions and how many votes they have globally. Added variable for storing the reactions creator.\nAdded reaction statistics to user profile. Created a new My Reactions section on the ReactionMenu, which displays your most popular voted reactions.\nRemoved CK Editor and built its own rich text editor that supports embedding video clips and embedding images.\nRemoved Downshift and built its own suggestion list that sorts by a basic algorithm of newest and most popular.\n\nThere's about two dozen other enhancements that I forgot to write down. This project gave me a ton of insight into our current limitations. I got so familiar with GPT, that I could tell when they dumbed down the system due to high loads.\n\nAI is going to be the great equalizer.

The concept has circulated for decades, although it is true that with the price of launching stuff in space going down, it could be a cost effective way to lower the temperature on Earth. It still poses 2 huge issues: - who controls the thermostat? The UN? tall order‚Ä¶ - temperature is only one part of the problem. the CO2 we are releasing gets absorbed by oceans who turn more acidic, which has a huge impact on wildlife. fewer solar photons warming the Earth won‚Äôt help at all with that aspect of the problem.\n\noverall, a worthwhile tool but not a silver bullet",

Plants would be affected by an alteration in the composition of solar light they‚Äôd be receiving. Not all the radiations of the spectrum are used for photosynthesis, but some are used for other important biochemical processes and others like UV are the reasons for the production of many antioxidants in plants. I did my master research on the effects of using natural light modifying films in greenhouses on vegetable production, and I witnessed how the alteration of the light can affect plants. We can manipulate light to benefit some plants in a controlled environment like greenhouses, but the light requirements of plants are as different as they are, so the idea of altering the solar light that reaches earth might lead to unexpected severe consequences, which is frightening to me.",

Let that sink in.\n\nIf molecular particles were the culprit of global increased temperatures? The easiest, cheapest solution would be large-scale fire breaks across the northern hemispheres boreal forest (there were very large fires in Russia and China, too).\n\nThe result of the fires. A concentration of sulfur in the northern hemisphere. Sulfur leading to decreased plant growth, as observed in Scots pine tree rings, the most important species in boreal Eurasia.\n\nGenerating a negative self-reinforcing feedback loop.\n\nInstead, we are mining new resources, exploiting labor, destabilizing regions for renewable energy; resources, production, and consumption.\n\nI'm absolutely for less pollutants in the air I breathe. 1 of the reasons I moved to my current country of residence.\n\nOnly it feels that clean air quality and water are not of real significant import to decision makers and money takers",
