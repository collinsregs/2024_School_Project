Why, the other night we even measured one incredible drawer as 24\" x 36\" x 22\" !!!\n\nHighly unusual but nevertheless very, very exciting!\n\nOnce they heard of my Great Tragedy, they got all excited because they wanted to test their own number theories and applications in combinatoon and permutation formulas!\n\nSo yeah, we tried every possible configuration, even though nothing came out of it, it was a very exciting time and once we found out that our permutations were correct and that it was 24 possible configurations, we partied super hard like there was no tomorrow!\n\nWe blasted elevator music and got totally wasted. We even formed a mosh pit and slammed dance to Kenny G and Richard Marx when they came on. It was a very exciting time despite the heaviness of the Greek Tragedy that weighs down my shoulders.\n\nThanks for your help and if you want to join our highly elite, high class club, I'll vouch for you since you tried to help me out!

Yes they can see the domain you are looking for (assuming you are using their DNS servers, as most standard users are doing) but your web access can leak much more than that. The ISP can, if they are configured that way, see the actual address you go to (i.e. domain.com/lookingforomething). Now this varies greatly by ISP, their intentions and things such as if you use http or https. This benefits the ISP greatly by knowing notonly where you're going, but what you're going for. Example your cable/isp are the same. You may search for something on the web, and mysteriously start getting associated ads on your TV. This is not coincidence. HTTPS hides many things but here is a cnippet from one of the sites I linked below\n\n\"But this is also true even if users are accessing HTTPS websites. The ISPs will know to what site the user is connecting because the HTTPS protocol isn't perfect, and some parts of the HTTPS connection are not encrypted.\" Which is a fancy way to say some https data is actually leaked.\n\nDNS over HTTPS (DOH) that some browsers force by default also isn't always the best:\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/dns-over-https-causes-more-problems-than-it-solves-experts-say/\n\nhttps://vpnoverview.com/privacy/anonymous-browsing/browser-leak-test/\n\nAs for Apps, you'd need to know what they are doing. They are loading thigns from the internet...Is the app using encrypted connections? Maybe. Is the ISP watching actual traffic on their network (i.e is it http, ftp. torrent, streaming etc) can they mitm see what's happening? Maybe.\n\nUnfortunately many of these questions end up with could be, maybe and finish off with do you trust your isp or app developer. I, personally, do not. So I use a VPN with a verified no logs policy that has been court tested.\n\nAlso be sure to actually look at the privacy policy and what the app/isp/website collects and what permission you are giving them. Many people unknowingly/unwittingly give permissions for these places to do exactly that, track everything you do. For instance almost every (free at least) app on google play includes their admob/doubleclick etc api's. That's how they are free, and many apps will ask for far more permissions than they actually require. There was a big thing some years back (ok maybe many years) regarding flashlight apps, before most phones had the ability to do it in the OS> Many of these apps were showsn to be asking for, and collecting information from, location services. What legitimate purpise would a flashlight have to location? SO when you install an app and it tells you permissions used, be sure to closely read them, and ask why that permission is necessary to do what you got the app for.",

The results can be trusted if a problem is detected but are basically worthless if not.\n\nThe most reliable way of finding faulty DDR4 and DDR5 has been to use the system as you normally would (not running memory diagnostics) but with only one DIMM installed to see if the crashes stop in that configuration. Then do the same but with the other DIMM installed instead - the idea being to isolate a faulty DIMM since it's rare for more than one to be bad.

Moving an existing Windows installation to a new machine with new motherboard/CPU is where you can start to get issues\n\nThere's one possible minor issue, which is that if a drive that is cloned in a \"dumb\" fashion - just sector-for-sector copied - the partitions will be the same size on the destination drive, and you may have to use a tool to extend your main partition into the new empty space (and maybe move partitions to perform said extension if they're in the way).\n\nIgnore that for now, though - I watched a guy use the software, and it did successfully extend his main partition to fill the new drive. I can't tell if it's always able to do that, but it's fixable if it doesn't.\n\nAs far as drive letters go, they're not stored on the drive, the OS keeps a list of what partitions have been assigned letters. C: is an exception, the partition you're booting from will always be C:.\n\nWhat drive is booted from is determined by the boot order in your UEFI/BIOS, but this is not something you should need to worry about, the computer should figure it out if there's only one bootable disk attached.",

        "comment": "Ah, the quest to get Minecraft, with all its blocky splendor, running smoothly with shaders can indeed be a puzzling journey, especially when your powerful GPU isn't being fully utilized. You're diving into the quirky world of OpenGL on AMD hardware, where sometimes, the GPU behaves more like it's on a casual stroll through the park rather than a sprint. Here's how to coax more effort out of your Radeon 5700 XT:\n\n1. Update Your Drivers\n\nFirst off, ensure your AMD drivers are up to date. AMD occasionally rolls out optimizations for OpenGL games, and staying updated is crucial. Visit the AMD website to download the latest drivers.\n\n2. Tweak AMD Radeon Settings\n\nDive into the AMD Radeon Software and tweak a few settings specifically for Minecraft:\n\nGo to Gaming > Add a Game, and add Minecraft.\nOnce added, explore the game-specific settings. Increase the Texture Filtering Quality to Performance.\nTurn on Radeon Anti-Lag and Radeon Chill, setting the minimum and maximum FPS to values that match your monitor's refresh rate or slightly above.\nEnsure that Vertical Refresh or V-Sync is turned off in both the Radeon settings and Minecraft's in-game settings to avoid capping your FPS.\n3. Java & Minecraft Optimization\nAllocate More RAM: If you haven't already, allocate more RAM to Minecraft, especially if you're running heavy shaders. This can be done in the Minecraft Launcher under the installations tab, by editing your installation, and adding more RAM in the JVM arguments (e.g., -Xmx4G to -Xmx8G for 8GB).\nUse OptiFine: Even though you're already using Iris and Sodium, ensure you're on the latest versions of these mods for the best performance. OptiFine is another alternative that provides detailed control over Minecraft's graphics and performance settings.\n4. Adjust In-game Settings\n\nWithin Minecraft, lowering certain settings can indirectly allow your GPU to work more efficiently: - Lower the Render Distance a bit. - Turn off V-Sync. - Adjust Graphics to Fast where you're comfortable doing so. - Reduce Shadow Quality and Water Quality in shader settings.\n\n5. Check for Background Processes\n\nEnsure there aren’t heavy background applications eating up resources. Sometimes, it's not about how much of the GPU Minecraft is using, but rather if something else is using resources that could otherwise be allocated to the game.\n\n6. Adjust Windows Power Settings\n\nSet your Windows Power Plan to High Performance or Ultimate Performance (if available). This can be found in the Control Panel under Hardware and Sound > Power Options.\n\n7. Consider Other Bottlenecks\n\nEven though you mentioned there are no bottlenecks, it's good to double-check. Sometimes, CPU limitations can cause low GPU usage, especially in a game like Minecraft that can be more CPU-intensive than it seems at first glance.\n\nIn Summary\n\nThe interaction between AMD GPUs and OpenGL can indeed be finicky, particularly with games like Minecraft that aren't as straightforward to optimize as others. By following these steps, you're essentially fine-tuning your system to ensure it's giving as much as it can to Minecraft, allowing your Radeon 5700 XT to flex a bit more muscle. If after all this, you're still seeing underutilization, it might just be a quirk of how Minecraft interfaces with your specific GPU architecture, especially regarding OpenGL.",

        "comment": "Ah, stepping up to the dual-monitor life, are we? That’s a game-changer for productivity (and let’s be honest, for gaming too). Your Lenovo Legion 5 is a solid base for such a setup, but you're right, the single HDMI port does present a bit of a puzzle. Fear not, for there are several ways to expand your display real estate without resorting to wizardry:\n\n1. USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 Docking Station\n\nIf your Legion 5 model comes equipped with a USB-C port that supports DisplayPort Alt Mode or Thunderbolt 3, you’re in luck. You can use a docking station or a multiport adapter to connect multiple monitors. These docks can offer various outputs (HDMI, DisplayPort, etc.) and allow you to connect several devices, including two monitors. Check your laptop’s specs to confirm if the USB-C port supports video output.\n\n2. DisplayLink USB Adapters\n\nFor laptops without USB-C or Thunderbolt 3, or if the USB-C port doesn’t support video output, DisplayLink USB adapters are a lifesaver. These adapters connect to your laptop's USB-A or USB-C port and provide an external video output (HDMI, DVI, VGA, or DisplayPort). You can use one of these adapters for your second monitor. The technology basically converts USB data to video signals, allowing you to add extra monitors over USB.\n\n3. USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter\n\nIf your laptop has a USB-C port that supports video output but you're not keen on getting a full docking station, a USB-C to dual HDMI adapter might be just what you need. This is a simpler solution than a docking station and can directly connect two HDMI monitors to your laptop via a single USB-C port.\n\n4. External GPU (eGPU)\n\nThis is a more expensive and complex solution, but it's worth mentioning for those who might also want to boost their laptop's graphic performance. An external GPU connects to your laptop via Thunderbolt 3 and, besides improving graphic performance, provides additional ports, including outputs for multiple monitors.\n\nChoosing the Right Solution\n\nCheck your laptop's ports and capabilities: Before purchasing any solution, verify what kind of ports your laptop has and what each port is capable of. Your Lenovo Legion 5’s specifications will guide you in choosing the compatible option.\n\nConsider your monitors' inputs: Make sure the solution you choose matches the input options on your monitors. Most modern monitors have HDMI, but some may offer DisplayPort, VGA, or DVI.\n\nFuture-proofing: If you're investing in a docking station or a DisplayLink adapter, consider other ports you might need. Getting a device with additional USB ports, Ethernet, and SD card slots can be beneficial.\n\nPerformance: Note that while DisplayLink adapters are versatile, they may introduce a slight lag, which is usually not noticeable in productivity tasks but might be in high-speed gaming or precision design work.\n\nBy expanding your display setup, you're not just adding screen space; you’re creating a more flexible and productive environment. Whether it’s coding, gaming, or just having more digital elbow room, you’ll wonder how you ever managed with a single screen. Welcome to the multi-monitor club!",

While you're not a computer expert, you've got me in your corner, and together, we'll try to navigate the dairy dilemma you've found yourself in.\n\nFirst things first, when it comes to liquids and electronics, the two mix about as well as oil and water—or in your case, milk and motherboards. The fact that your laptop is functional is a good sign, but the weird static sounds are the laptop's way of crying out for help. It's saying, \"I'm not okay!\"\n\nBefore we consider it a total udder disaster, here's what you can do:\n\nPower Down: If you haven't already, turn off the laptop and unplug it from any power source. This reduces the risk of further damage or short-circuiting. Your laptop needs to fast from any electrical input while it's in this fragile state.\n\nDry It Out: Since you've mentioned the spill happened yesterday, it's likely that the milk has already started to dry. However, if there are any wet spots you can safely reach without disassembly, gently dab (don't rub) with a lint-free cloth.\n\nDon't Play Screw Roulette: Stripping the head of a screw is a sign to stop. It's like the laptop's way of saying, \"I need a professional.\" Since you've mentioned the screws aren't budging and you've already damaged one, it's time to put the screwdriver down. Further attempts might harm the laptop's case or internals.\n\nSeek Professional Help: This is a situation where a tech repair shop is your best friend. They have the tools, expertise, and experience to safely open up your laptop, clean it properly, and assess any damage. The static sounds you're hearing could be due to milk affecting the laptop's internal components, like the speakers or cooling fan.\n\nAssessment and Repair: A professional can tell you whether the laptop just needs a good cleaning or if components need to be replaced. They'll also be able to safely remove that stripped screw without damaging your laptop.\n\nIn the tech world, we often say, \"Move!\" But in this case, I'll say, \"Pause!\" and let's get a professional to take a look. Attempting a DIY fix without the proper tools or experience could turn a potentially simple repair into a total loss.\n\nSending your laptop to a repair shop might be inconvenient and possibly a bit costly, but it's the best course of action to avoid further damage. And hey, consider it a learning experience. In the future, keep beverages at a safe distance from your tech gadgets. Let's turn this spill into a skill!",

        "comment": "Ah, the classic tale of gaming laptop woes meets charger swap saga. It's like you've hit a speed bump on the information superhighway. But fear not! Let's break this down, \"Nick Burns, Your Company's Computer Guy\" style, and get you back to those smooth 140fps glory days.\n\nFirst off, the switch to a non-official charger and the wobbly DC port are our prime suspects in this performance drop mystery. Here's why:\n\nPower Supply Issues: Using a non-official charger can sometimes be like playing electrical roulette with your laptop. If the charger's specifications (voltage, amperage) don't exactly match what your laptop requires, it could lead to insufficient power supply during high-performance tasks like gaming. This can cause your laptop to throttle performance to conserve power.\n\nWobbly DC Port: A wobbly DC port isn't just an annoyance; it's a red flag. This could mean that your laptop is not receiving a consistent power supply, which might cause it to intermittently switch between battery and AC power. This switch can throttle your performance to save energy, just like a confused chameleon trying to adapt to its environment.\n\nHere's what you can do to troubleshoot and potentially solve these issues:\n\nCheck Charger Specifications: Make sure the new charger matches your laptop's original charger's output voltage and amperage. This info is usually printed on the chargers and on the bottom of your laptop. If they don't match, it's time for a charger that does.\n\nStabilize the DC Port: If the port is wobbly because it's physically damaged, it's like having a shaky foundation on a house. You might need a professional to solder or replace the DC port to ensure a stable connection.\n\nBattery Settings and Performance: Dive into your power settings and make sure you're set to the highest performance mode. Sometimes, a new charger or power source hiccup can flip your laptop into trying to save the planet by reducing its performance. We're all for saving the planet, but not at the cost of your gaming experience.\n\nThermal Throttling: Check if your laptop is running hotter than usual. A new power source could theoretically cause your system to heat up more, leading to performance throttling to prevent overheating. Make sure your cooling vents are clean and consider using a cooling pad.\n\nHardware Stress Test: Use software tools to run stress tests on your CPU and GPU. This can help determine if there's an underlying hardware issue beyond the charger and DC port situation.\n\nProfessional Help: If all else fails, it might be time to seek professional help. A tech expert can take a closer look at your DC port, motherboard, and overall laptop health to pinpoint the exact cause of your woes.\n\nRemember, when in doubt, \"Move!\" Let the experts take a crack at it if you're not comfortable poking around the insides of your laptop. Here's to getting your gaming experience back to peak performance, without any fps drops or power supply dramas!",

        "comment": "Oh, the dreaded \"Internet Connection Problem,\" a classic tale of modern woe where the quest for a strong Wi-Fi signal turns into an epic journey. Your plan to tether a new router in your bedroom via an Ethernet cable to your main router in the living room is not just logical; it's a stroke of genius worthy of a tech wizard. Let's break it down, Nick Burns-style:\n\nWired Connection: Running an Ethernet cable from your main router to a second router in your bedroom is like building a high-speed highway directly to Connectivity City. It bypasses the airwaves crowded with interference from walls, microwaves, and who-knows-what else your neighbors are up to. This setup will indeed provide a stable and fast connection.\n\nNew Router or Access Point?: While you can use a second router, you might also consider setting it up as an Access Point (AP) instead. This approach can be more straightforward and avoids potential issues like double NAT (when both routers assign IP addresses, causing network confusion). Access Points are designed to extend your Wi-Fi coverage seamlessly.\n\nEthernet Cable Quality and Length: Make sure you choose a high-quality Ethernet cable that can handle the speeds you're aiming for. A Cat 6 or Cat 7 cable is a good future-proof choice. Also, keep in mind that Ethernet cables have a practical limit of about 100 meters (328 feet) before signal degradation, but that's usually way more than any home needs.\n\nSetting Up the Second Router: If you go the second router route, you'll need to configure it properly. This means setting it to operate in bridge mode or turning off DHCP so it doesn't conflict with your main router. Essentially, you want it to act as an extension of your network, not a separate network.\n\nWireless Mesh Networks: Before you start drilling holes and running cables through your home, consider whether a wireless mesh network system might be an easier solution. These systems come with a main router and satellite units you place around your home, creating a seamless and strong Wi-Fi network. They're designed to overcome the very issue you're facing, without the need for Ethernet cabling.\n\nProfessional Installation: If running an Ethernet cable feels like a daunting task, especially if it involves long distances or complicated routing through walls and ceilings, hiring a professional might be worth considering. They can ensure a neat and effective installation.\n\nIn summary, your approach is solid, but there are options regarding the details. Whether you opt for a new router configured as an AP, a straightforward AP, or even a mesh network depends on your preferences for cost, ease of setup, and aesthetics. Each has its pros and cons, but all are viable solutions to conquer the final boss in the game of Internet connectivity.",

        "comment": "Hey there!\n\nYou've dived into the nitty-gritty of PC gaming optimization with the zeal of a true tech enthusiast! Let's untangle this a bit. Your approach to cooling down your Legion 5 by adjusting the \"Minimum Processor State\" setting in the power plan was a clever move, reminiscent of a skilled mechanic fine-tuning a high-performance race car. However, this tweak comes with its own set of side effects—namely, the drop in your FPS during intense gaming sessions like in Escape from Tarkov.\n\nHere’s the deal: The \"Minimum Processor State\" setting controls how hard your CPU works at its lowest level of activity. By setting it to 1%, you've essentially told your CPU, \"Hey, take it easy, buddy,\" even when it's not doing much. This can be great for keeping things cool and saving battery life, but it's a bit like putting training wheels on a racing bike; it's going to slow you down when you need speed the most.\n\nWhen your game revs up and demands more power, your CPU has to jump from a nearly idle state (1%) to meet the demand. This sudden leap can cause a delay in ramping up, thus affecting your FPS as the processor takes its sweet time getting up to speed. It’s like trying to sprint without a running start.\n\nHere's what you can do to balance performance and cooling, without compromising too much on either:\n\nAdjust the Minimum Processor State: Instead of dropping it all the way to 1%, find a middle ground. Experiment by gradually increasing it and see how it affects both your temperatures and FPS. You might find that a setting between 40%-70% keeps the CPU cooler than at 95% but doesn't hamper performance as much as the 1% setting does.\n\nCooling Solutions: Look into additional cooling solutions. A cooling pad can be an effective and inexpensive way to help manage your laptop's temperature. Also, make sure the laptop's vents are clean and not obstructed.\n\nPower Plan: Make sure you're using a balanced or high-performance power plan while gaming. This allows your laptop to better manage performance needs against thermal and power constraints.\n\nMonitor Temperatures: Keep an eye on your CPU and GPU temperatures with software like HWMonitor or MSI Afterburner. This can help you understand how your tweaks affect thermal performance and find the sweet spot for your system.\n\nUpdate Drivers: Ensure that your GPU and chipset drivers are up to date. Sometimes, performance issues can be resolved with the latest drivers, as they often include optimizations for newer games.\n\nIn-game Settings: Adjust the game's graphics settings. Escape from Tarkov is known for its demanding nature. Lowering some settings could provide a smoother experience without a significant visual downgrade.\n\nRemember, gaming laptops are a balance between performance, thermals, and noise. By tweaking your settings and adding some external cooling help, you can find a good balance that lets you game without turning your laptop into a mini-volcano. Keep experimenting—just like in gaming, finding the right strategy can lead to victory!",

        "comment": "Alright, scooch over, let's dive into this classic tech conundrum you've got here. \"Move!\"\n\nFirst off, it sounds like your PC is giving you the silent treatment - no beeps, no video, just a cold shoulder. While you might have thought your GPU was playing hard to get, especially with those fans acting like they're too cool to spin without a software prompt, it seems like there's a deeper mystery afoot since the problem persisted even after you gave the onboard graphics a shot.\n\nHere’s a checklist of troubleshooting steps that’ll make Sherlock Holmes wish he was a PC tech instead:\n\nPower Supply Check: The power supply is the heart of your PC, pumping that sweet electric lifeblood to all your components. If it's not strong enough or failing, it can cause symptoms like these. If you have a spare one, swap it out and see if that brings your PC back to life.\n\nMotherboard and CPU: No POST can also be a sign of a motherboard or CPU issue. Since there's no beep (which usually indicates the motherboard is at least trying to do its thing), it might be a motherboard failure. Make sure the CPU is properly seated and not damaged. If you have the means, testing with another motherboard or CPU can be illuminating.\n\nCheck the Speaker: Make sure your case speaker is connected properly to the motherboard. It's possible it's not connected or malfunctioning, and you're missing out on diagnostic beeps.\n\nClear the CMOS: This resets your BIOS settings back to default. It's a Hail Mary pass that sometimes resolves issues preventing POST. Look for a CMOS jumper or simply remove the battery for a few minutes, then put it back in.\n\nRAM Roulette: You've reseated the RAM, but let's take it a step further. Try booting with just one stick at a time, swapping slots if it doesn't work. Sometimes it's a particular slot or stick that's the party pooper.\n\nDisconnect Everything Non-Essential: I'm talking about hard drives, SSDs, peripherals – strip it down to just the motherboard, CPU, one stick of RAM, and the power supply. If it POSTs, start reconnecting things one by one until you find the culprit.\n\nInspect for Physical Damage: Look for blown capacitors, scorch marks, or anything that looks out of the ordinary on the motherboard and GPU. Sometimes the signs of failure are visible to the naked eye.\n\nGiven your GPU's fans were dodgy and needed software to kickstart them, it's a good reminder that components can exhibit odd behaviors before giving up the ghost. However, since the problem persists without the GPU, it's time to look beyond it.\n\nI know troubleshooting can be a journey, half tech wizardry, half patience-testing. If none of these steps resurrect your PC, it might be time to consider visiting a professional or possibly looking at replacements for the more critical components. Remember, it's all part of the grand adventure that is PC ownership. And hey, once you solve this, you'll be the one saying \"Move!\" to the next person in need of tech help.",

        "comment": "Ah, the classic quest of upgrading to a larger SSD without the hassle of a clean Windows install! You've chosen a trusty steed in Clonezilla for this journey, but it seems like you've hit a bit of a snag. Let's troubleshoot this like the tech knights of yore.\n\nFirst up, let's make sure your USB stick is truly boot-ready:\n\nBootable USB Creation: Double-check that you created the Clonezilla USB correctly. It's not just about copying files over; the drive needs to be made bootable. Tools like Rufus or Balena Etcher are champions in this arena. They'll take the Clonezilla ISO and properly prepare your USB stick for booting.\n\nSecure Boot: In the BIOS, check if Secure Boot is enabled. Secure Boot can sometimes prevent booting from unofficial media, like your Clonezilla USB stick. If it's on, try turning it off. Remember, navigating BIOS settings is a bit like exploring a labyrinth - each motherboard has its own layout.\n\nUEFI vs Legacy Mode: Clonezilla needs to match your system's boot mode. If your system uses UEFI (most modern systems do), ensure the USB is formatted and prepared for UEFI boot. Conversely, if you're on an older system that uses Legacy boot, your USB needs to be prepared for that. This setting can also be toggled in the BIOS.\n\nUSB Port: Sometimes, the choice of USB port matters. If you're using a USB 3.0 port, try a USB 2.0 port instead, and vice versa. Some systems can be picky about which ports they'll boot from, especially with older BIOS versions.\n\nRe-download and Re-create: It's not unheard of for downloads to get corrupted, or for the USB creation process to go awry. Re-download the Clonezilla ISO and recreate the bootable USB. It's the digital equivalent of \"turn it off and on again.\"\n\nCheck the USB on Another PC: To rule out the USB stick being the issue, try booting from it on another PC. If it doesn't work there either, it's a sign the bootable USB wasn't created correctly.\n\nBIOS Update: If you're feeling brave and your motherboard is an older model, a BIOS update can sometimes resolve boot issues. However, tread lightly here; updating BIOS is like casting a powerful spell. It can bring great benefits but comes with its risks.\n\nIf you've marched through these steps and still face the dark sorcery of boot failure, it might be worth revisiting the USB creation process or even trying a different USB stick altogether. Sometimes, the most stubborn problems have the simplest solutions.\n\nMay your SSD cloning quest end in victory, with your new, spacious M.2 SSD as the spoils of war. And remember, in the world of tech, persistence (and a bit of Googling) is key!",

        "comment": "Absolutely, you've got a plethora of options to make calls across continents as if you were just around the corner. The magic you're looking for comes in various forms, such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, apps, and some nifty features provided by mobile carriers themselves. Here's how you can stay connected without racking up a bill that'll make you want to take up residence in a monastery:\n\nVoIP Services: Services like Skype, Viber, and Google Voice allow you to make phone calls over the internet. Google Voice, for instance, can give you a phone number that you can use to make and receive calls through the internet. This can be particularly handy as it can often allow you to choose a number from your home country.\n\nWhatsApp, Telegram, and Similar Apps: While these are primarily known for messaging, they also offer voice and video call functionality over the internet. You won't be using your phone number in the traditional sense, but you can call any of your contacts who use the same app. The call goes through the internet, so you won't be charged for international calls by your carrier.\n\nUsing Your Carrier's International Plans: Some mobile carriers offer international plans or features that allow you to use your phone number abroad as you would at home, sometimes with added costs, sometimes surprisingly affordable. It's worth checking with your carrier to see what options they have.\n\nWi-Fi Calling: This feature allows your phone to make and receive calls over a Wi-Fi connection instead of using the cellular network. If your phone and carrier support Wi-Fi calling, you can make calls as if you were in your home country, using your regular phone number. However, availability can vary based on your carrier and the country you're in.\n\nUsing a Local SIM Card with a Dual-SIM Phone: If your phone supports dual SIMs, you can insert a local SIM for data and still keep your original SIM active for calls and texts. This way, you can use internet-based calling services without incurring roaming charges.\n\nWhen using VoIP or app-based calling, remember that while the calls might be free or cheaper than traditional international calls, they will use your internet data. If you're on a limited data plan or using mobile data abroad, keep an eye on your usage to avoid unexpected costs.\n\nFinally, the experience can vary based on your internet connection's quality, so for important calls, make sure you're on a stable and fast connection to keep the conversation flowing as smoothly as your tech-savvy reputation.",

        "comment": "Ah, the infamous blue screen of doom, meeting you right at the crossroads of hardware upgrades. Swapping from AMD to Intel isn't just a matter of switching hats; it's like moving to a whole new planet. Your PC is probably just as disoriented as you are right now, especially with that AMD-related error popping up after installing an Intel CPU. Here’s how you can tackle this tech quandary:\n\n1. Clearing Out Old Drivers:\n\nThe error AMDRyzenMasterDriver.sys suggests that the AMD Ryzen Master software (which is for AMD CPUs) is causing a conflict. Since you've moved to Team Intel, that software is about as useful to you now as a chocolate teapot. Normally, I’d suggest booting into Safe Mode to uninstall it, but since you're stuck in a boot loop, we’ll need to take a different approach.\n\n2. Getting Into BIOS/UEFI:\n\nNot being able to access BIOS/UEFI is like trying to fix a car with the hood welded shut. Since the usual keys (Esc, Delete, F2, or F8) aren’t working, ensure you’re pressing them at the right time. Start tapping the key right after powering on. If it still doesn't work, try resetting the CMOS, which can help clear any settings preventing access:\n\nReset CMOS: Look for a CMOS reset jumper on your motherboard or, the more nuclear option, remove the coin battery on the motherboard for a few minutes, then reinsert it. This resets the BIOS/UEFI to default settings, potentially allowing you entry.\n3. Boot Media to the Rescue:\n\nIf the BIOS/UEFI gate remains closed to you, it's time to create a Windows Installation Media on a USB drive from another computer. This little lifesaver can not only help repair your system but also gives you the chance to get into Safe Mode or use the System Restore feature:\n\nCreate Installation Media: Use another PC to download the Windows Media Creation Tool from Microsoft's official site and follow the steps to create a bootable USB drive.\nBoot from USB: With the drive created, plug it into your troubled PC, power it on, and immediately start tapping the key for boot menu options (commonly F12, F10, or Esc, depending on the motherboard). Select your USB drive from the list to boot from it.\n4. Safe Mode or System Restore:\n\nOnce you've booted from the USB, you’ll have a few options to help exorcise the AMD ghost from your machine:\n\nSystem Repair: Sometimes, just starting this tool can fix issues preventing boot.\nSafe Mode: From the repair/advanced options, you can choose to boot into Safe Mode. If you manage to get into Safe Mode, uninstall the Ryzen Master software and any other AMD-specific drivers.\nSystem Restore: If Safe Mode access is granted, and uninstalling the AMD software doesn’t work, try using System Restore to roll back to a state before the hardware change, if possible.\n5. Fresh Install:\n\nWhen all else fails, and you're staring into the abyss of eternal blue screens, a fresh installation of Windows might be your silver bullet. This will wipe your drive, so it's the last resort, but it ensures no old drivers from AMD are there to haunt your new Intel setup.\n\nSwapping CPUs and motherboards is a big leap in the PC world, kind of like switching from coffee to tea for a caffeine fiend. It’s disorienting at first, but once you've cleared out the old drivers and made peace with the BIOS, you'll be back to computing nirvana in no time. Remember, deep breaths, and maybe keep a stress ball handy.",

This can happen due to various reasons such as software corruption, failing hardware components, or even issues with the battery you mentioned. Here's what you can try to potentially resolve the issue before taking it in for the battery replacement or professional help:\n\n1. Force Restart\n\nYou've mentioned that the buttons aren't responding, but it's worth trying a force restart if you haven't done so in the exact manner required. To force restart the LG G6: - Press and hold the Power button and the Volume Down button simultaneously for about 10 seconds or until the device powers off and restarts. - This can sometimes interrupt the boot loop and allow the device to start up normally.\n\n2. Enter Recovery Mode\n\nIf the force restart doesn't work, the next step is to try booting the phone into Recovery Mode to perform a factory reset. Note: This will erase all data on your phone. If you have important data not backed up, consider this a last resort. - Turn off the device (since it's stuck, you might have to wait for the battery to run out). - Once off, press and hold the Power button and Volume Down button simultaneously. - When the LG logo appears, release and then immediately re-hold the Power button while still holding the Volume Down button. - When the \"Factory data reset\" screen appears, use the Volume buttons to navigate to \"Yes\" and the Power button to select it. Follow the prompts to reset your device.\n\n3. Let the Battery Drain and Recharge\n\nIf you're unable to perform a force restart or get into Recovery Mode, letting the battery drain completely and then charging it might reset the state it's stuck in. Once the battery is drained: - Plug it into the charger and let it charge for a while without turning it on. - After some time, try turning the phone on again or attempting the force restart.\n\n4. Battery Replacement\n\nSince you mentioned having a new battery and experiencing issues like the phone dying at high battery percentages, replacing the battery might resolve the problem if it's related to battery health. However, if the boot loop issue is due to software corruption or other hardware issues, the new battery alone might not fix it.\n\n5. Seek Professional Assistance\n\nIf none of the above steps work, it's best to seek professional assistance. There might be underlying issues such as motherboard problems or severe software corruption that require specialized attention.\n\nThe boot loop issue can be frustrating, but taking these steps will help you diagnose whether the problem can be resolved through these methods or if professional repair is necessary.",

        "comment": "Ah, the classic maneuver of trying to turbocharge your storage setup with a bit of hardware jujitsu, only to have Windows throw a wrench into the gears. Let's navigate these choppy waters.\n\nFirstly, the heart of the issue here is the way Windows handles SATA SSDs connected via a SATA to USB 3.0 converter. When SSDs are connected directly to the motherboard's SATA ports, the operating system has full control over the drives, allowing you to manipulate them in various ways, including converting them into dynamic disks. However, when these drives are connected via USB, even with a SATA to USB converter, they're treated differently due to the nature of USB storage.\n\nHere's Why You're Hitting a Roadblock:\n\nUSB Limitations: Windows Disk Management imposes certain limitations on USB-connected drives. USB drives are typically recognized as removable media, and Windows restricts certain functionalities on removable media, including the inability to convert them into dynamic disks.\n\nDynamic Disk Feature: The dynamic disk feature is designed for internal disks rather than external ones. This functionality allows for more flexible management of your disks, such as creating spanned, striped, or mirrored volumes, which is not intended for use with external (USB-connected) drives.\n\nStorage Spaces as an Alternative: You've already found the alternative path through using Storage Spaces, which allows you to pool drives together. However, as you've noticed, it doesn't quite hit the mark performance-wise compared to a striped volume via dynamic disks. Storage Spaces is more about flexibility and redundancy rather than outright speed.\n\nWorkarounds and Solutions:\n\nDirect SATA Connection: The most straightforward solution to achieve the performance you're seeking is to keep the SSDs connected directly to the motherboard's SATA ports. This might not be the ideal solution since you're trying to free up those ports, but it's the most effective way to leverage dynamic disk functionality and performance.\n\nExternal RAID Enclosure: Consider investing in an external RAID enclosure that supports multiple SSDs. These enclosures can manage RAID configurations internally and then connect to your computer via a single USB or Thunderbolt connection. This way, you can achieve higher data transfer speeds similar to what you'd get from an internal dynamic disk setup, with the added benefit of keeping your SATA ports free.\n\nCheck for Software Solutions: There might be third-party software solutions that allow you to manage external drives more flexibly than Windows Disk Management or Storage Spaces. However, tread carefully, as these solutions can vary in reliability and performance.\n\nReview Your Setup's Requirements: Reflect on what you're trying to achieve with your setup. If it's purely about expanding storage, Storage Spaces might suffice. But if performance is critical, sticking with direct SATA connections or exploring an external RAID enclosure might be the way to go.\n\nIn essence, while it's frustrating when tech doesn't bend to our will, sometimes it's about finding the right tool for the job or adjusting the job to fit the tools at hand. Keep experimenting, and with a bit of creativity (and maybe a new gadget or two), you'll find a setup that meets your needs. And hey, in the process, you're amassing an arsenal of tech knowledge that would make any IT pro proud. \"Move!\" – let's get those SSDs flying.",

        "comment": "Choosing the right laptop for your needs, especially when you're balancing cost, performance, and specific uses like SOLIDWORKS and gaming, can indeed be challenging. Let's break down your options between the MSI Cyborg 15A 13Ve and the ASUS TUF Gaming A15, focusing on key aspects like performance, build quality, and overall value for your specific needs.\n\nPerformance\n\nMSI Cyborg 15A (Intel Core i7 13620H & RTX 4050): The Intel Core i7 in this model is a high-performing CPU, likely offering superior single-threaded performance which is beneficial for applications like SOLIDWORKS and drawing/rendering tasks. The RTX 4050 GPU is well-suited for both your gaming and professional applications.\n\nASUS TUF Gaming A15 (AMD Ryzen 5 7535Hs & RTX 4050): AMD Ryzen processors are known for their excellent multi-thread performance, which can be a big plus for rendering tasks. However, the Ryzen 5, while powerful, might lag slightly behind the i7 in single-threaded tasks. The RTX 4050 GPU, being the same in both, should offer similar performance for your gaming and rendering needs.\n\nBuild Quality and Reliability\n\nMSI Laptops are generally well-regarded for their gaming performance and cooling technology, though some models may indeed have louder fans under heavy use. Battery life varies by model and usage, so if reviews mention battery issues, consider how this might affect your mobility needs.\n\nASUS TUF Series is designed for durability, meeting MIL-STD-810H military standards. The TUF series has a reputation for good cooling solutions, but as with any gaming laptop, fan noise under load is common. Heating issues have been noted in past models, but ASUS continually works on improving thermal performance in the TUF lineup.\n\nSoftware and Operating System\nThe MSI coming with Windows 11 is a significant advantage if you're concerned about software legality and security. Using a cracked version of Windows on the ASUS, as you mentioned, comes with risks, including security vulnerabilities and potential software incompatibilities.\nOther Considerations\n\nUpgradeability: Both brands typically offer access to upgrade RAM and storage, which is a plus for future-proofing your investment.\n\nWarranty and Support: Consider the warranty length and terms, as well as the manufacturer's support reputation in your region.\n\nBattery Life: For non-gaming use, battery life is an important consideration. Check reviews for each model's battery performance under typical use cases similar to yours.\n\nPrice vs. Value: If the ASUS is significantly cheaper and the potential performance differences don't justify the cost for you, especially considering your usage patterns, it might offer better value.\n\nPersonal Recommendation\n\nGiven your interest in SOLIDWORKS, drawing, rendering, and occasional gaming, both laptops will serve you well, thanks to the RTX 4050 GPU. If software legality, better single-threaded performance, and potentially quieter operation are priorities, and the price difference isn't too steep, leaning towards the MSI Cyborg 15A might be the way to go.\n\nHowever, if budget constraints are tighter and you're comfortable managing potential software risks, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 offers great value and durability, especially for rendering tasks that can leverage its multi-threaded CPU performance.\n\nUltimately, consider which features align best with your priorities and whether the trade-offs are acceptable for your specific needs and budget.",

        "comment": "A ticking sound coming from a laptop that won't turn on or charge can be concerning, but it's a good clue to start diagnosing the issue. While I can't hear the sound directly, based on your description, here are several potential causes and troubleshooting steps to consider:\n\n1. Power Supply or Charging Circuit Issue\n\nThe ticking noise could be related to the power supply or charging circuit within the laptop. This might happen if the laptop is trying and failing to draw power, resulting in a periodic ticking as it attempts to engage the charging circuit.\n\nTry a Different Charger: If available, use a different compatible charger to rule out an issue with your current charger.\nCheck the Charging Port: Inspect the charging port for any debris or damage that might prevent a proper connection.\n2. Hard Drive\n\nIf your laptop has a traditional spinning hard drive (HDD), the ticking sound could indicate a failing drive. However, if the laptop won't turn on at all, this might not be the primary issue, but it's something to consider if you manage to power it on later.\n\nSSD vs. HDD: Note whether your laptop uses an SSD or HDD. SSDs don't have moving parts, so if you have one, the ticking is likely not from the drive.\n3. Motherboard or Component Failure\n\nA more concerning possibility is a short or failure in the motherboard or another internal component. The ticking could be a relay or another component on the motherboard trying to activate but failing.\n\nTroubleshooting Steps:\nDisconnect Everything: Remove all peripherals, including the power cord, and hold down the power button for about 30 seconds to discharge any residual power. Then try turning it on with just the charger connected.\nInspect Internally: If you're comfortable doing so, open the laptop to check for any obvious signs of damage or loose components. Ensure the battery (if removable) is securely connected.\nMemory Check: Try reseating the RAM sticks if accessible. Faulty or improperly seated RAM can cause startup issues.\nListen for Beeps: If the laptop attempts to start, listen for any beep codes. These can diagnose issues related to the motherboard or other components.\nSeeking Professional Help\n\nGiven the symptoms — especially if the laptop makes a ticking sound but doesn't power on — you might be dealing with a hardware issue that requires professional diagnosis and repair. If the laptop is still under warranty, or if you have access to a professional repair service, consider this route to prevent potential further damage.\n\nIn cases like these, accurately identifying the problem without professional tools or skills can be challenging, and the risk of causing further damage by attempting repairs yourself might not be worth it, especially with critical components like the motherboard.",

        "comment": "It sounds like you're dealing with a tricky situation with your MSI Z87-G45 GAMING motherboard. Clearing the CMOS and flashing the BIOS are two different processes used for troubleshooting and updating the motherboard, respectively. Let's tackle them step by step.\n\nClearing CMOS\n\nClearing the CMOS is a way to reset the BIOS settings to their factory defaults. It doesn't update or flash the BIOS version; instead, it might help solve issues preventing access to the BIOS setup. Since you mentioned a \"clear CMOS\" button, follow these steps:\n\nTurn off your PC and unplug it from the power source.\nPress the 'Clear CMOS' button on the back of your motherboard. This button is usually located near the USB and Ethernet ports. Hold it down for about 10 seconds.\nPlug the PC back in and try to boot it up again. Check if you can access the BIOS now.\n\nIf your motherboard doesn't have a dedicated Clear CMOS button, you can also clear the CMOS by removing the battery on the motherboard for a few minutes, then reinserting it.\n\nFlashing the BIOS\n\nFlashing the BIOS is a process to update the BIOS firmware. MSI's feature called M-Flash allows flashing the BIOS from within the BIOS setup menu itself, but since you can't access the BIOS, you're looking for another method.\n\nSome MSI motherboards support a feature called BIOS Flashback, which allows the BIOS to be flashed without needing to access the BIOS or even have a CPU installed. However, the MSI Z87-G45 GAMING motherboard does not support BIOS Flashback. Therefore, if you need to flash/update the BIOS, you must find a way to access the BIOS setup first.\n\nIf You Still Can't Access the BIOS\nCheck Your Keyboard: Make sure you're using a basic USB keyboard connected directly to the USB ports on the motherboard. Wireless keyboards or keyboards connected through USB hubs might not be recognized early enough during the boot process to enter the BIOS.\nTry Different Keys: Although the key to access the BIOS is typically Delete or F2 for MSI motherboards, try pressing F1, F10, or F12 during boot as well, just in case.\nBIOS Update Requirement: If you absolutely need to update the BIOS and cannot access the BIOS setup, your best bet might be to contact MSI support or a professional repair service. They might offer solutions or services to update the BIOS for you, potentially using a programmer or a motherboard replacement if necessary.\n\nPlease proceed with caution when attempting to clear the CMOS or update the BIOS, as incorrect steps can potentially harm your motherboard. If you're unsure, seeking professional help is always the best course of action.",

Given the steps you've already taken, let's dive into some additional avenues that might help resolve this HDMI hiccup on your AMD Radeon RX 580:\n\nCheck for Ghost Monitors\n\nWindows sometimes \"remembers\" monitors that were connected in the past, leading to scenarios where a non-existent second monitor is detected. This can cause the issues you're experiencing. Here's how to check for and remove ghost monitors:\n\nRight-click on the desktop and select Display settings.\nIf you see two displays listed, try to identify which one is the phantom display.\nSelect the ghost monitor, scroll down, and click on \"Remove this device\" under \"Multiple displays\" if the option is available.\nAlternatively, go to Device Manager (right-click on Start > Device Manager), expand Monitors, and see if there are any extra monitor devices listed that you can right-click and uninstall.\nAdjust Power Settings\n\nSince you mentioned a suspicion about power-saving settings related to sleep mode, it's worth adjusting those settings to see if it resolves the issue:\n\nGo to Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Power Options.\nClick on \"Choose what the power buttons do\" on the left side.\nClick on \"Change settings that are currently unavailable\".\nUncheck the box next to \"Turn on fast startup (recommended)\", Save changes, and restart your computer.\nFirmware Update for Monitor\n\nAlthough less common, some monitors may receive firmware updates to address compatibility issues. Check Acer's support website for any firmware updates for your G276HL monitor. Updating the monitor's firmware, if available, could potentially resolve the issue.\n\nTry a High-Quality HDMI Cable\n\nWhile you've tried different HDMI cables, ensure you're using a high-quality cable capable of handling the full bandwidth required by your display settings. Lower quality cables might not support higher resolutions or refresh rates properly.\n\nWindows System File Check\n\nCorrupted system files can sometimes cause unusual behavior. Running a system file check might help:\n\nOpen Command Prompt as Administrator.\nType sfc /scannow and press Enter.\nAllow the scan to complete and repair any corrupted files.\nHardware Test\n\nAlthough changing the GPU didn't resolve the issue, testing your Radeon RX 580 in another system (if possible) could help determine if the HDMI port itself is the problem.\n\nContact Support\n\nIf all else fails, consider reaching out to AMD support for further assistance. It's possible they may have additional insights or solutions specific to your GPU.\n\nGiven the troubleshooting steps you've already performed, this issue is indeed tricky. However, exploring these additional avenues may provide some clarity or a potential solution to the HDMI display problem.",

        "comment": "Yes, there are several ways to download multiple files at once from a website without relying on a specific application like JDownloader. Depending on the browser you use, there are extensions and built-in features that can help streamline this process. Here are a few methods:\n\nBrowser Extensions\n\nDownThemAll! (Firefox): This powerful download manager and accelerator can help you download all the links or images on a webpage and much more. It gives you full control over what you download, including filters to download only the files you really want.\n\nChrono Download Manager (Chrome): Chrono offers a similar functionality for Chrome users, integrating tightly with the browser to manage all your downloads. It can sniff out all links, images, and audio/video files on a page for bulk downloading.\n\nBatch Link Downloader (Chrome): A simple yet effective tool for downloading multiple files from a webpage at once. You can specify a pattern to match for the downloads or simply choose from the detected files.\n\nBrowser Built-in Functions\nFirefox Multi-Select: Firefox has a built-in feature allowing you to select multiple items on a webpage by holding down Ctrl and clicking on each desired link, then right-clicking and choosing \"Save Link As...\" for each. While not fully automated, it's a built-in solution without needing extra software.\nUsing Command Line Tools\nwget: A free utility for non-interactive downloading of files from the web. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as retrieval through HTTP proxies. With the right command, you can download multiple files or even mirror entire websites. However, it requires a bit of command line knowledge and is more suited to advanced users.\nManual Methods\nIf the number of files isn't too large, opening each link and manually saving the file might work, though it's not efficient for a large number of files.\nBefore You Download\nCheck Website Policies: Before downloading multiple files, especially with third-party tools, check the website's terms of service to ensure you're not violating any policies.\nBe Mindful of Security: Downloading in bulk can sometimes lead to inadvertently downloading malicious files. Ensure your antivirus software is up to date and scan downloaded files.\nNote\n\nSome extensions or methods might not work on all websites due to how files are hosted or presented. Experimenting with a couple of different tools or extensions may be necessary to find the best solution for your specific needs.",

It may seem unnecessary, but the first thing someone who has your credentials does, is check all the major pages if they can log in with the same exact password. You want to use passwords you never used before as well, because you don't know which one got leaked.\n\nConsider a password manager if you struggle to remember them all. Activate Two-Factor-Authentication (2FA) if you haven't yet, this will prevent unauthorized individuals from logging in, even if they have your password. Make sure to use rolling codes, as these change every 15, 30, or 60 seconds with most 2FA apps, which makes it much harder to brute force, as you can't just increment it slowly until you get it.\n\nGoogle authenticator is a 2FA app many android users would probably use. I personally (though not objectively) recommend avoiding Microsoft's tools, as their website and many products in general are buggy and broken, so you may end up logged out of your account, having to wait over a month to do anything. Which 2FA app you use is completely up to you.\n\nIf you do not find your E-Mail address breached, it is likely that malware executed on your machine. It would be near impossible to tell what exactly it did, without analyzing it in a sandbox, and reverting the changes it made can be a challenging task to say the least, especially if made changes to Registry keys or system files, as these are not only more difficult to manipulate, they also allow changes that may break the OS entirely, if values are changes incorrectly, which is why a reinstallation is necessary",

Do not hesitate to ask if you are not sure about something, better to ask twice than not at all.\n\nThe reinstallation from a USB (or DVD, etc.) is necessary, as malware may have made changes to Windows' repair partition, and thus can reinstall itself. Some malware may even be fancy enough to detect if you make a bootable, and inject itself onto it - while uncommon, it is not impossible, so it is recommended to use a different PC to create a bootmedium. You can use the Windows media creation tool, this does not support Windows 10 anymore though, as Windows 10 is only offered as iso now from all I have heard. You may need a tool like Rufus to create a bootable using the iso, as your motherboard does not detect the iso itself as a bootable, you can imagine it as if you have a library full with books - normally files only would be the books, but an iso file includes the entire library building too.",

If you don't have any zip software installed, right click on the folder and select Send to → Compressed (Zipped) folder.\n\nUpload to any easy to use file sharing site. Reddit keeps blacklisting file hosts so find something that works, currently catbox.moe or mediafire.com seems to be working.\n\nWe like to have multiple dump files to work with so if you only have one dump file, none or not a folder at all, upload the ones you have and then follow this guide to change the dump type to Small Memory Dump.

Usually cable companies are providing their internet using physically shared cabling from their \"node\" to the residential structures. This is considered the \"last mile\" in networking jargon. Usually business customers will have more dedicated infrastructure which is why business Internet is more expensive.\n\nRegardless, every Internet service provider oversubscribs their last mile runs for residential customers. Similar to how airlines overbook flights expecting some people to not show up or change at the last minute. It works most of the time, but every once in a while you have bad service.",

The only way to 'fix' the issue is to have the company's certificate installed on the computer which basically just tells the computer to trust that certificate so it won't cause privacy/security warnings in the browser.",

That's a good baseline to start troubleshooting.\n\nIf your cpu is overheating, it will downclock severely to prevent a thermal shutdown.

Even in nvidia the 3050 can play cyberpunk 1080p comfortably with more than 60fps, let's not even talk about older graphics or laptop versions. That for me the 3050 would still be medium-low at best since still plays anything without problems. Low end is the worst of the worst, in case of phones the ones less than 80$, in cars, a 10 year old second hand car that when was brand new was still inexpensive.",

The only options are integrated (iGPUs) or discrete cards. You could consider iGPUs are low end, but then you can consider dumb phones as the equivalent in your Apple analogy. It's a totally different market with different requirements and products suited to them.\n\nIn the discrete GPU market, the 'low end' of the current range is the RTX 4050/60, RX6400 or ARC3 range.\n\nThe 3050 you mentioned is the older range, so in your analogy, it'd be the iPhone SE 2nd Gen. The 4050 is the current version, so the SE 3rd Gen.\n\nYes, the older models will 'do the job' (which is already dependent on opinion and circumstances) but for how long in terms of newer games and driver support? The 3050 in CoD MW3 already needs a mix of low/mid settings to run reliably over 60fps.\n\nYou mention playing a relatively old title (4ish years old) at an old resolution (still popular but 1440p and 4k are above it, so low end in that case) at a lower framerate (90+ is mid and 120fps+ is high end) all of which point to a lower end card.",

        "comment": "Alright, strap in, because you're about to embark on a noble quest to breathe life back into that HP ProBook 450 G6. It sounds like you’ve already rolled up your sleeves and dived headfirst into the troubleshooting deep end, which is commendable. Given the symptoms and your efforts so far, let’s sketch out a game plan to tackle this electronic enigma.\n\nStep 1: Deep Clean\n\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty of voltage testing and potential motherboard woes, let's address the dust bunny convention you've described. A dirty laptop can lead to overheating and, in some cases, short circuits, which might be contributing to your issues.\n\nCleaning: Power down the laptop (well, it’s already off, but let’s pretend). Open it up and carefully clean out the dust and debris. A can of compressed air can work wonders here, especially for the fan and vents. Be gentle around sensitive components.\nStep 2: Re-Evaluate the Basics\n\nIt’s easy to overlook the simple stuff when we’re deep in tech triage mode. Let's backtrack a smidge and make sure we’ve covered the basics:\n\nPower Supply & Battery: You’ve replaced the charger and battery, which is great. Ensure the new battery is properly seated and the charger is indeed compatible with the ProBook. Just because it fits, doesn’t mean it’s the right one.\n\nPower LED Blink Codes: The blinking LED when you insert the battery is actually a Morse code for troubleshooting. HP has documentation on what these blinks mean. Fast blinks followed by a pause can indicate various issues, from a bad battery to motherboard problems. Refer to HP’s support site for the exact blink code interpretation.\n\nStep 3: Dive Deeper into Troubleshooting\n\nSince swapping out the usual suspects hasn’t fixed the issue, it’s time to dig a little deeper:\n\nMultimeter Magic: You mentioned not being an electrical engineer, and that's perfectly okay. Using a multimeter to check for continuity and voltage can still provide valuable insights. Check the voltage at the power connector on the motherboard where the battery connects, and compare it to the expected voltage. If you're not getting the right voltage, there could be a problem with the power delivery on the motherboard.\n\nInspect for Damage: With the laptop open, inspect the motherboard for any signs of physical damage or corrosion, especially around the power circuitry and connectors. Look for burn marks, bulging capacitors, or any other signs of distress.\n\nStep 4: Consider the Motherboard\n\nIf, after all your efforts, the laptop still refuses to turn on or charge, the motherboard could indeed be the culprit. Motherboard issues can be tricky and expensive to fix:\n\nCost vs. Benefit: Weigh the cost of a replacement motherboard against the laptop's value and your investment so far. Sometimes, the economics just don’t add up.\n\nReplacement: If you decide to replace the motherboard, ensure you get the exact model designed for the 450 G6. Given your adventurous spirit, this could be a valuable learning experience.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nDon’t lose heart. Even if the laptop doesn’t come back to life, consider this an investment in your tech troubleshooting education. Every problem faced is a skill gained.\n\nAnd hey, if it turns out the motherboard is toast and not worth replacing, you’ve still got a laptop full of potentially useful parts. The SSD, RAM, and even the display can find new life in other projects.\n\nRemember, in the world of tech repair, sometimes the journey is just as important as the destination. Keep tinkering, keep learning, and whatever you do, don't let a little dirt and disappointment dampen your spirits. You've got this!",

Disconnect your original windows hard drive and connect the new one. Use your windows install media to windows on the new one and just get a user account setup. Skip activation for now.\n\nShut off the computer, connect the damaged drive and boot using the live non-windows USB. Follow instructions for the operating system that the live environment is based on to open the large data partition on your old windows hard drive. Also open up the new windows drive. Now you can just copy files and folders directly from the old installation to the new one as long as the drive itself is intact. I also reccomend checking the disk for errors, you can search for the tools to do it on most live OSs\n\nIt’s not ideal and getting the new installation set up could be a chore but for pure data recovery this is a good option. And yes, you really should buy a new hard drive if the old one is acting suspicious. Complete failure to boot is alarming and storage is cheap. You could also just use a high capacity USB stick to store the files that you copy off the old installation.\n\nTLDR: Boot some operating system off a hard stick, forcibly open the windows disk from another OS, save what you can",

I have a much older HP laptop with SSD that takes under 10 seconds to boot, you shouldn't be stuck with almost 40 seconds on a ~2020 one. Whatever the case, suggest you get another opinion from somebody more knowledgeable with HP laptops and your specific dilemma here.",

It is difficult to see exactly what the symbol looks like in your photo, so you will need to look up the Thunderbolt symbol online to compare.

It doesn't appear the Mini Displayport connection on your laptop is Thunderbolt 1 or 2.\n\nFor Thunderbolt 3 and later versions, the USB-C connector is used, and again the ports are basically hybrid ports so they can work with regular USB-C devices, Thunderbolt devices, or can output video via a DisplayPort adapter.\n\nHowever, please see the edit in my first comment. Unfortunately it's possible that the lightning bolt symbol on your port is just indicating that it can be used to charge devices. The Thunderbolt symbol is also a lightning bolt, but it's slightly different and has an arrow at the bottom of the bolt which I don't really see in your image (though it's a bit difficult to see clearly).\n\nIf you post the laptop model number, I could provide a more definitive answer regarding Thunderbolt support.",

These servers add headers to the email that contain useful information, including the IP address of the sender.\n\nTo access an email’s header, open the email and click on “View message source.” A pop-up window will appear with a long string of code. Within this code, search for “Received from” to find the sender’s IP address.\n\nNext, go to a website such as IP-Lookup.net or IP-Tracker.org and enter the sender’s IP address to trace their approximate location.\n\nKeep in mind that this method may not always work, as some senders are able to conceal or mask their IP address. In that case, you can try one of the methods mentioned above.\n\nThis will narrow down the location and if you know somebody who lives in that area, you may have your suspect.\n\nGoodluck and God Bless!",

Unless it's a credible threat against your safety, I have only one piece of advice:\nDISENGAGE.\n\nDon't reply, don't escalate, and don't put a target on your back by reacting to such a thing from such a person. (See \"Narcissistic Personality Disorder\" and remember to not feed the trolls.)\n\nIf you escalate by poking them, there's a high likelihood it will only serve to affirm their efforts to disturb you.\n\nTL;DR: Mark the email as spam or add it to your blocked senders list, and be done with it. (This is for your own mental/emotional health & peace of mind.)\nIf you suspect there's a credible threat to you or others, that's when you escalate, but only escalate it to law enforcement. Don't take matters into your own hands.",

It's kind of like how when you drive a car you accept that a bolt could become unscrewed in the drive shaft, but the likelihood is extremely low.\n\nMaybe try not to piss people off in video games too, need to stop owning them so much 🤣 /s",

And even in the case that there was some sort of vulnerability within a game, you'd have to have really pissed someone off to want to go after you. Or terrible luck of the draw. But in all actuality, it doesn't seem to me that at a basic consumer level that hacking into your system could be done through a video game, let alone why you'd be targeted in the first place.\n\nI work at an old folks home and I run the IT Support there. I get asked fairly regularly how to deal with hackers and viruses and stuff and I'll honestly tell them I don't pay attention to it.

If you don't have any zip software installed, right click on the folder and select Send to → Compressed (Zipped) folder.\n\nUpload to any easy to use file sharing site.

Some countries alternatively used the SECAM format.\n\nIf you attempt to play a PAL VHS Tape (e.g. from Europe) in an NTSC VCR (e.g. from North America), for example, you may get unexpected results like black-and-white video that has lots of static.\n\nThere are also other possible explanations. One thing to check would be can you access the VCR menus and do they look normal on the TV?

(If you're searching the entire screen for a specific image, it may introduce a slight delay to reaction time. The smaller your search area, the better your reaction time.)\n\nWhen searching for missing hay (e.g.: searching for a change to an existing area), this can be a bit tricky.\nWhat you do is take a control (that is, determining what is normally there).\nThen you can (with varying degrees of fineness), set up a baseline of smaller points of analysis.\nOnce you have a set of points to check, we just repeatedly cycle through those points, checking if any of them have changed.\nOnce a point being checked is different than its previous (control) state, we know something there has changed, and we can interact with whatever's there.\nAgain, the more points there are (finer degree of accuracy), the more time it takes to cycle through them all, checking whether they've changed.\n\nBut anyway, we'd need some way of determining the use case here.\nIf you've got any screenshots, or can name what your use case is (workspace automation, video game, etc), we can provide a relevant solution.",

Plug the USB flash drive that contains the MSI.ROM file into the BIOS FLASHBACK+ port on rear I/O panel. Press the BIOS FLASHBACK+ button to flash BIOS, and the light of BIOS FLASHBACK+ button starts flashing. After the flashing BIOS process is 100% completed, the button light would stop flashing and would be off simultaneously.\"\n\nHere is another post for intel motherboards:\n\n\"If you are using an Intel platform, some Intel motherboards have a way to update bios without the CPU. Check your manual. On Gigabyte boards, the feature is called \"Qflash Plus\". On Asus boards, the feature is \"USB BIOS Flashback\".\n\nIf your motherboard is from a different supplier, I would suggest finding documentation to see if you can flash the BIOS without POST. \"\n\nGood luck.",

This means that slots 2/4 and 1/3 run in dual channel.\n\nWith what you have, you want the 2x8 in slots 2/4 and the 1x16 in slot 3. The 2x8 will run in dual channel, the 1x16 will run in single channel.\n\nMixing sticks will lower the frequency and timings most likely, as it finds the lowest common denominator they can run together.\n\nIf you don't use over 16gb, you may get more out of it by just using the 2x8 kit. If you go over 16gb though, that third stick will help massively, even in single channel.",
