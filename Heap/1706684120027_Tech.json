I knew things like this system would begin rolling out around the world especially after seeing the effects of extremely low budget drones in recent conflicts. Watching a couple 100 dollar drones drop bombs on multi-million dollar top of the line military equipment and rendering said extremely expensive modern equipment useless in Ukraine and the Middle East has been a huge eye opener for weapons manufacturers around the globe, I‚Äôm sure. Cheap drones without effective countermeasures will render many armored and naval assets effectively useless or a liability. Especially in wars of attrition or when a high budget military fights guerrilla wars against opponents with access to these cheap effective drones",
