It does have an ethernet out port to, connect to the WiFi and then output ethernet.\n\nBut, that's it.\n\nIs there a TP-Link extender than connects to ethernet (WiFi via ethernet) and then outputs WiFi?\n\nSo, if there's an extender that does that - well I just didn't see it on the TP-Link website could you perhaps link it?\n\nAlso, as for the routers: aren't they generally quite big? And, seems quite extreme for what I'm looking for. Also, can a router really work with just an ethernet cable, I thought they needed another cable that connects directly to the wall and I forgot the name of, it has like a slider or something - maybe connects to a telephone?...

A budget friendly option to replace your laptop can be to check FB marketplace for good deals (cross-compare with eBay already-sold listings) and vet the seller’s account.\n\nA repair shop would likely charge at least $150 and there is a possibility that they cannot solve the problem without replacing the entire motherboard.

That's about the next best thing to getting a new drive and as close to it as possible to ensuring you've completely removed everything and won't have any lingering objects / issues. Some really well built malware (rootkits) can be persistent and linger even after a wipe. Plus, a fresh install is like Spring Cleaning for your computer. I do it once a year on all my devices just to keep them fresh. If you're concerned about your IP, call your ISP and have them change it, though I've read that resetting your modem will do that as well. I'd still call the ISP to confirm / have it done.\n\nAlso, no need for Malwarebytes. Windows Defender performs just as well as anything else on the market.

You can have a look at the SPDs with CPU-Z's SPD tab, if they're the same then it's okay, but if the SPD data is different then you're mixing RAM. If seen mixed RAM fail many times. Especially if you mix chips from different manufacturers (Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron).\nWith four single rank modules your (Ryzen 3000-series) CPU supports up to DDR4-2933. If you set it to DDR4-3200 you're overclocking the CPU IMC. I've also seen this fail many times. This can also cause problems after it worked fine for many months or even years.\n\nAs for the SSD, unfortunately Samsung 980 Pro SSD had a huge firmware QC issue.

Obviously we didn't have admin rights on them, this was mainly to prevent us from installing software that would distract us during class but once the loan period was over we were given full control over the laptop although we were no longer covered for damages. Assuming your school uses a similar system you may have to wait until the loan period is over, or if you need app/software for a specific class that not many people are doing, then you might be able to get perms to do so. I suggest asking your IT guy for more answers on it though as they should know how it works",

        "comment": "Bandwidth (how much raw data can be transferred per second) is limited to the slowest connection between any two points. So say you're downloading a game from Steam, the data might go from Valve server to Valve's ISP, their ISP to your ISP, your ISP to your modem/router, your router to your PC. Let's say Valve have 1000 Mega bit per second internet, the ISPs have a 1,000,000Mbps link between them, and you have 500 Mbps 5G internet.\n\nScenario 1: the WiFi between your router and PC only gives you 300 Mbps. Then your max bandwidth is 300 Mbps since that's the slowest link in the chain.\n\nScenario 2: You move your PC closer to the router, and surprise, now your WiFi gives you 800Mbps! But, your internet connection is still limited to 500 Mbps internet, so that's your max bandwidth because it's the slowest link.\n\nWith scenario 1, changing from WiFi to Ethernet would improve your max bandwidth. With scenario 2, it wouldn't. So while Ethernet is usually higher bandwidth than WiFi, whether that improves your maximum bandwidth depends on whether the WiFi is the bottleneck, or your internet connection (or something further up the chain, like the server you're downloading from).\n\nHowever, bandwidth is not the only factor determining \"connection strength\" as you called it.\n\nPacket loss is another issue. Some types of connection are more reliable than others. Ethernet uses a shielded cable to send information as electrical signals, generally speaking there isn't much data loss. WiFi sends information using radio waves, anything from walls to microwaves to the planet Earth itself can interfere with those signals. Packet loss is much higher. The more packets that get lost, the more frequently they have to be retransmitted. So even if WiFi can theoretically send a packet of data really fast, the end result - your download speed - isn't great if you have to resend packets 3, 4 or a dozen times. This accounts for the biggest difference between the \"theoretical maximum bandwidth\" of WiFi, and the actual time it takes to transfer a file of a certain size.\n\nLatency is yet another issue. Where download speed is how many data packets reach you per second, latency is how long it takes for a packet to reach you after you request it. This is another area where WiFi loses. Because radio waves are so prone to interference, there's a lot of complicated work that happens to transmit and receive them reliably. A lot of checking and double checking and confirming receipt and so on. Not to mention the work involved in physically converting electrical signals from the computer to radio waves and back again. Since 5G also uses radio waves, it has the same problem. And the other issue is, unlike bandwidth which is basically the slowest link, latency is cumulative. So if your WiFi has 12ms of latency, this is added to 20ms latency of your 5G connection, the 3ms of your ISP to Valve's ISP, and the 1ms between Valve's server and their ISP.\n\nSo even if bandwidth were equal, latency can make your internet experience feel worse. But on the flip side, it also means that improving the latency of just one of the connections (realistically, the only one you have any control over is the WiFi) will improve your overall latency. So really it depends on what exactly you mean by \"connection strength\" (latency, bandwidth, or both?) and where your biggest bottlenecks are.",

But that also relies on having support infrastructure on the cloud side, which will be costly.\n\nrsync also can compress data for transit (-z option), I couldn't find any evidence that Dropbox does but I'd be surprised if it didn't, the API docs should indicate whether it does or not.\n\nWhether either of those solutions are of any benefit highly depends on the structure of the data in your specific file. Either of the above might work great if it's eg. a text file, and you basically only append lines or modify the occasional existing line. But for example a database file (eg. from a SQLite DB), an encrypted file, a zipped file, or really any binary file; those algorithms may not necessarily work effectively.\n\nIf your focus is on efficiency of data synchronization, you should probably implement your own process/API that can understand the context of the data and synchronize it with maximum efficiency.",

The closest think to a desktop is bulkier laptops called desktop replacements which partially are bigger for the better cooling.\n\nCooling pads typically increase airflow to help cool the laptop from underneath, there are various types and models. You'll have to search for one that meetings your budget and needs.\n\nOther than that, the reality is we don't ways yet to make small devices toss a ton of power into cpus for high performance and not output a significant amount of heat for what it's being used for. I have never seen a gaming laptop that runs the same kind of temperatures that a desktop can, and my gaming rig still runs at 70c under max load, with it's big case, multiple case fans and water cooling, large radiator etc. You get the picture, making it laptop size is going to crank up the heat.",

A conflict with secure boot and any newer bios clearing cmos will do nothing because the default is on.\n\nI believe before you updated clearing cmos would have worked, it's just sometimes they can be stubborn to clear. For future reference here is my preferred procedure:\n\nDisconnect mains power.\n\nPress and hold the power button for a few seconds.\n\nRemove the CR2032 button cell.\n\nShort JBAT1(next to the battery holder in your case) with something metalic/conductive for approximately 30 seconds.\n\nThat ensures all capacitors are drained and it isn't being fed by standby power. This becomes important if you want to try going forward and attempt to fix the initial problem.\n\nIf you do I would recommend running the firmware I linked earlier. Even though it isn't your actual problem it does alter the GOP module and importantly re-sign the cards firmware. Secureboot uses firmware signatures so it's a chance of a fix. If an update is available and you install it you would have to enable secureboot again to test if it helped. See reset cmos procedure if there is no change.",

It has uses, but they are few and far between. I could see how a cable that's not the same on both ends could be regarded as a USB-B.\n\nThis particular cable tester would show you if there as a link across the pins within the cable, which can be useful to tell you:\n\nif the cable is internally damaged (data transmitted but not received)\nif a cable lacks internal wiring on certain pins (USB-A 2.0 cables only have 4 pins, USB-A 3.0 cables have 9- could be false advertised cables)\n\nHowever other cable testers like this one for USB-A/USB-C that are more comprehensive on charging data, such as the speed of charging, etc that may be able to better diagnose a cable that fails to meet a spec or fails to charge due to a hardware fault. If you don't care about the particular pin that's damaged, this would be the better tester for charging speeds/capabilities.\n\nAs for the cables becoming loose, this is typically if not always a hardware issue. The female port you are plugging the cable into likely has a bent pin or something else that's causing damage to the cords and will continue to do so until replaced. May be worth taking a smartphone camera to get a good close-up of the ports to see if you can spot any abnormalities among them, and avoid the ports that are showing these issues. Outside of that, on the hardware level, just be sure to pull the cord out straight, not at an angle, as that can also cause the issue and is often overlooked when it becomes a bad habit that you don't even realize occurs.",

Do you have any advice on any simple ways for a layperson to repair the ports in the case of common physical deformities?\n\nGreat advice on how to properly detach the cables too, I'm definitely going to have to be more conscientious on not pulling them out at an angle in the future. I just realized that one possibility is that I've actually just worn out these USB-C cables over time; I used to go through micro-USB cables much faster so maybe what I'm seeing with these USB-C cables is normal.",

Connect your iPhone 15 to a computer with a USB-C cable.\nStep 2. Now press Volume Up button and release. Press Volume Down button and release. Next press the Side button for 10 seconds. Your iPhone’s screen will go black.\nStep 3. Continue pressing the Side button and press the Volume Down button again, this time for 5 seconds.\nStep 4. Let go of the Side button while continuing to press the Volume Down button for 10 more seconds. Your iPhone’s screen will remain black during this whole time.\nNow your iPhone has entered DFU mode.

It lets you format the C: drive without losing personal data (or having to redownload Steam games). Applications usually aren't big enough to justify installing on a separate drive, and even if you install them on D:, if you ever wipe and reinstall the OS on C: they have to be reinstalled anyway, negating any advantage of separating them.",

Take a look at MusicBrainz Picard for example. It will not only help update your media files with the correct tags based on their online music database (artist, title, album, year, cover art etc) but it also gives you options for automatically organising files and folders based on those tags (eg. %artist%\\%album% (%year%)\\%title%.mp3).",

It also depends how this is hooked up, do you have a cable provider? Do they have a gateway you're tapped into? Do they offer cable boxes? A lot of 'cable boxes' aren't actually via coax cable anymore, and are IPTV / go through the internet, sort of, more specifically through their own network to their content servers.\n\nAnd their network equipment is unlikely to report as 'my internet company router' and instead show their chipset name, E.G if your internet provider was Meganet, their chipset is likely from cisco, just with meganet branding, so when looking at devices on your network, it's going to show cisco, not meganet.\n\nWhat are the 4 devices that you can trace the cable to that are connected to your lan port?",

This is a permenant fix.\n\nThe temporary one is-when this happens-not from windows press and hold power for 10 seconds. This will force a low level power reset. Do not do it from windows-it will abruptly power off.\n\nThe adapter will work again after this for awhile. Look for a newer driver-do not use third party utilites for this!",

There used to be free/trial versions of various software that everyday non-pro users could utilize to clone their drives but I understand that those are somewhat rare these days. You may have to buy something.\n\nSome SSDs will come with (or have available for download) cloning software. I think Samsung does BUT that might not work in your situation because your first step would not be using a Samsung SSD.\n\nLook for cloning software and read up carefully to make sure it’s a real thing and will do what you want. Read and follow directions carefully.\n\nNote that if your drives are of different sizes, you’ll need to set the cloning software to properly account for the difference.\n\nYou might also consider imaging your drive for backup purposes using Windows built-in backup software, installing the OS on your new SSD, then restoring the backup image to your newly-installed OS on your new SSD. Assuming you stay with the same OS on old and new of course.\n\nAbout terminology:\n\nYou want to clone your drive.\n\nMirror is used for a thing called RAID, which you’re not doing.\n\nAn image is for backup purposes.",

(Or something that can do full analogue surround in with the 6/8 RCA jacks or 3/4 3.5mm jacks)\n\nFor doing it with that system, you're going to need to hunt for some sound card that can do Dolby Digital Live and/or DTS Connect encoding to optical out, but external USB things that could do that were pretty rare and driver support for them in recent Windows is getting kinda dodgy since they're all around a decade old now. PCIe cards for desktops were somewhat more common, or driver hackery to allow the software to work on some motherboard's built in audio.\n\nIf you just want to play videos that already have a DTS/Dolby soundtrack in surround you should™️ be able to do that already if you use player software that supports passthrough mode (but then while the video's playing you'll have no volume control and no other programs will be able to play sound).",

See if there are any you can't identify.\n\nNote -- it can be tricky to account for everything that shows up there. There's the obvious stuff, like your phone, computer, game consoles, streaming boxes or TVs. But then there may be less obvious things, like wireless printer, a smart light you forgot you connected, etc. You can google their mac addresses for the manufacturer, but it's not always obvious what's what since it may only tell you who made the network chip.\n\nYour router may also let you show traffic by device, though. If one of them is hitting the connection hard, and you can't identify what it is or a good reason, try kicking it off your network. If a device you or a household member actually owns throws up an error, you'll know what was causing it, and you can choose whether to reallow it on the network. If not, either you've just shut off access to some background process you didn't really need, or you've kicked off a device that shouldn't have had access in the first place.",

A network expert can monitor for this info, but you're clearly more casual.\n\nBetter advice is if this is out of the ordinary and you aren't the one, and you do not share the home with anyone eg kids, spouse or roommate, then you're best off doing a factory reset on your router and having it setup anew with a fresh password.\n\nDoes the provider supply the router or do you own it? How old is it? Router exploits are possible, and moreso with older ones that are no longer receiving support. You would need a tech to log onto it and check that it is receiving updates, and that it is still eligible for updates. If they own the router then they should be doing this.\n\nThere's also potential here that your provider is simply wrong. They told you they suspect this presumably based off some IP address. If that is abnormal based on their own monitoring, then more investigation may be needed on their part.",

If it is not, then it was not a backup but a single instance of that data. If that is corrupted, one might end up with nothing. That is not what a proper backup is actually about.\n\nAlas OP seems to have found out the hard way. So maybe some data might still be recoverable (even though previous experience with SD cards is not that positive as as soon as an SD card was acting up, I would toss them out) using some recivery software or even involving a specialized data recovery company, which can become rather expensive.\n\nSo please people, make proper backups if you truly value your data?

The drive itself is fine but the table of contents that tells the PC how to read it is in a different format.

Check that all connections and cables are securely in place and clean the motherboard and parts carefully. Test each RAM stick individually, in different slots.\n\nIf that hasn't fixed things, update the BIOS to the latest stable version. Make sure that it doesn't reset to defaults that can cause issues, such as disabling UEFI and trying to boot in CSM/Legacy mode.\n\nIf you can, create a windows install USB flash drive with the Windows Media Creation Tool. Use that to boot and to enter the recovery environment. See if you can do a startup repair from there. If it can't do a startup repair, then try running an elevated command prompt from the USB drive. Type in chkdsk /f. That will likely require a reboot to run.\n\nIf it does run successfully, but that hasn't fixed the issue, then do the same again but this time run sfc /scannow, to check for system file corruption. If none of these work, then try an inplace Windows upgrade from the USB drive.",

But that doesn't block them, it just removes the knowledge they could use to call/message, and the knowledge that could be used to call them/message them. If that knowledge is later shared, then it's back to the start again.\n\nAlternatively, some service providers can block numbers from their end, so that nothing you could do on the phone could unblock them. But that depends entirely on phone provider if they offer that service or not. To unblock it would require the service provider's app/website or to call their customer service etc. So a little harder than unblocking using basic stuff.\n\nRealistically, if the user wants to contact someone who they have blocked, they can just use another channel. Like a messaging app or alternative sim card/phone number or social media. So if your problem is the user is unblocking the number, then the human problem is ultimately what needs addressing.\n\nIf you are the account holder and owner of the device (in the case of a child's device), I'd guess there would be a way of getting the service provider to block a number. And the child wouldn't have access to the credentials to log in/call to undo the block.\n\nAgain, this won't stop them using Discord or, WhatsApp or whatever.\n\nSo acting as a 3rd party and blocking someone from contacting someone else without that person's consent is not really a realistic option, afaik.",

It's best practice to use something like Malwarebytes together with a good anti virus, such as Avast, Bit Defender, Kaspersky and so on. Make sure you run full scans with both but not at the same time and don't run more than one antivirus solution on the same system. You can look up the rankings and scores on AV Comparatives, to see which products are doing the best most recently.",

There's always one who can't but help embarrass themselves by coming out with something that's provably factually just plain wrong, revealing to all that they have absolutely no idea what they're talking about and therefore have zero credibility and shouldn't be taken seriously. So thanks for doing everyone that service at least. :)\n\nThankfully though this isn't a matter of personal opinion, yours, mine, or anyone else's. What I think, or what you think is completely irrelevant. This is a simple, checkable fact. So nobody has to take just my word for it. It can be proved very easily and very quickly.\n\nAV Comparatives, which I specifically mentioned in my post (the one you obviously didn't even bother to actually read properly because you were so eager to embarrass yourself), literally help to determine the standards for antivirus certification.\n\nSo, instead of my opinion, or even worse, yours, let's see what one of the world acknowledged, professional organizations, responsible for certifying and testing antivirus solutions, says about Avast in their latest report, based on empirical data and testing (on facts in other words to get it across to you and those like you), updated just this month:\n\n​\n\nAvast takes a Top-Rated Product Award in 2023, after reaching Advanced+ level in six out of seven tests, and Advanced for the remaining test. It also receives Gold Awards for the Real-World Protection Test and Malware Protection Test...- AV Comparatives Summary Report 2023. Updated January 2024\n\nBut of course if you are more qualified than the organization that actually tests and certifies all the available antivirus solutions and determines their effectiveness, then by all means do stun the world with this great news. I'm sure that every major tech news outlet would be fascinated to hear about this new, previously unknown expert on systems security, who is even better than the body responsible for testing and certification. Or, just go troll somewhere else and stop embarrassing yourself.",

The most reliable way of finding a faulty DIMM with DDR4 and newer has been to use the system as you normally would (i.e. - NOT running memory diagnostics) but with only one DIMM installed to see if the crashes stop. Then do the same but with the other DIMM installed instead. The idea being to isolate a faulty DIMM since it's rare for both to be bad.",

Even the free versions of these anti virus solutions are solid.\n\nBut also run Malwarebytes and do full scans with both the antivirus and the antimalware. Just, not at the same time. Let them find and clean anything that they find. In future, scan anything that you download from some shady site and keep your antivirus enabled and turned on.",

This is a bug in their hotkey configuration.\n\nThe only fix I've found is to just disable HKKbdFltr from being used (It's the driver that is actually at fault). If you want to do this, go into the registry and navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Control\\. Right click on the Class folder and select Export so that you have a backup. Now expand the Class folder, click on Class and do Ctrl+F to search because this string is annoying to find manually. Search for \"4d36e96b-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318\" and it should move to this folder and it should look like this (Ignore the non-english parts).\n\nThe Data field of the UpperFilters registry should look like this on your machine: \"HKKbdFltr kbdclass\". If it does, right click on it, select Modify and remove \"HKKbdFltr\" so that it just says kbdclass. Restart the PC and see if you still crash.",
