However, this requires the car to sink completely to the bottom or to at least become full with 0 air inside. Most people would be dead very quickly. Once your car enters the water, you will not be able to open the doors.\n\nINSTEAD:\n\nRip off the rear-view mirror from the windshield and use that to shatter the back or front window and swim like hell, far enough that the suction of the car sinking doesn’t pull you back. If you can smash out the front or back windshield before the car fills with water, you have a MUCH higher chance of survival. Most of the demonstrations of how a car opens once it’s full of water are done in like, swimming pools and shit. The bottom of a like is a whole other story.\n\nRipping off the mirror was shown to be doable for even small children or the elderly, and because of the shape it will easily shatter a curved pane of glass.\n\nDon’t remember what the video was called, but I watched someone drive off a bridge and perform it pretty easily.",

China owns all US iphone production as a consequence. How is this not defacto ownership of the iphone? China can make a zillion perfect iphone copies from the same production lines, which is the point of facilitating such arraignments either voluntarily, quasi-voluntarily or by force.

Manufacturing companies like Tesla have to sign over IP rights over the period of a few years depending on the contract they sign\n\nThat’s why anytime a big western company moves into China, a few years later a Chinese home grown company starts producing almost identical goods under a different name, usually from the same manufacturing lines as the original, and then China pushes out the western company all together from being able to compete.

The launch of tik tok shop was to help this, but came at great cost to the quality of the platform. The first monetization change was with those live gifts, which also damaged the platform's content.\n\nTik tok is a goliath, but a truly difficult to tame one.

        "comment": "A couple of points from this opinion piece:\n\nFrom chatbots to personalized menus, from Autocado (the avocado-slicing droid in use at Chipotle) to face-scanning candy-bar machines, these intelligent technologies are all deployed to increase revenue while reducing labour costs. Last year, 14 per cent of restaurateurs in the United States said that they had invested in technology that replaced an employee in 2023. Much of the automation is in quick-service restaurants. In full-service restaurants, diners still expect to be greeted by humans. But in QSRs, efficiency rules. For these restaurants, revenue has grown over the past year, while for the rest of the dining industry it has shrunk. While all restaurants have benefitted from the automation of taking reservations, managing inventory, and processing orders, QSRs are able phase out whole job categories.\n\nThe purely physical versions of new restaurant tech — sweetly named restaurant robots that make tortilla chips (Chipotle’s Chippy) or French fries (White Castle’s Flippy) — are children’s toys compared to the AI-powered software in today’s order-taking kiosks. The technology inside these kiosks is able to adjust pricing, promote specials, and customize the menu’s presentation in real time. The goal is not merely to automate a previously human job, but also to improve performance by increasing the average bill size and ordering frequency.\n\n…\n\nIf the restaurant app companies successfully frame the issue as a benefit to consumers, they’ll succeed where the vending machines got caught with their robot mandibles in the cookie jar. They’re not asking to invade our privacy. They’re offering to optimize our experience!\n\nThere won’t be a referendum on this issue. Our governments are always streets behind the speed of the tech industry. Within a year, once enough of us have clicked away our expectation of privacy in exchange for 15 per cent off on our next order, this conversation may be over.\n\nIt’s been fairly well known for a while now that many people are more than happy to trade away their privacy and/or security online in exchange for what are effectively baubles and trinkets. Ideally, governments would be able to regulate these companies on the public’s behalf, but thus far they’ve been either unwilling or unable to do so effectively.",

It's safe to assume a lot of companies have all cut costs in their manufacturing and maintenance. Hence why we're also seeing many airlines with their own issues.\n\nThis is the state of the modern world. You guys hear about lead in metal bottle of waters? Yeah it's always been there and now people were freaking out, why? Because vacuum *sealed bottles always had a lead seal that was usually covered by another metal cap. Companies started cutting costs and cheapening the bonding material on that cap. Now those caps are popping off exposing the lead seal. What used to be decades for the bottom cap to pop off now takes a few years.\n\nAnd that's the thing, it usually takes a few years after a company cuts corners to save manufacturing costs for us to see the long term effects.",

(see graph) By modern standards, the old versions of the 737 would have been viewed as insanely dangerous. They would rip apart in mid air. This happened multiple times. Sometimes the roof would rip out.\n\nIn the 1990s, Boeing 737 rudder actuator would becomes stuck, and it took 3 planes crashing before they even figured out something was wrong.",

Douglas had a more infamous history with safety and a corporate culture with the worst of capitalism at its heart. They undermined the union based workforce, outsourced, gave up on safety as a priority, and engaged had their own employees act as regulators.\n\nIt takes years or decades for aerospace projects to come to fruition, so we're seeing the projects that are 100% the result of the bad corporate culture.\n\nIt's a bummer too, because growing up in Long Beach Douglas was one of those hometown industries like the Naval Shipyard. I had a family friend who worked for an Eastern European airline that bought Douglas aircraft and worked out of their offices in Long Beach. I learned CAD software there as a part of a high school explorer program.\n\nIt sucks that they ended up sucking so much.",

Also this is a wide body plane that is not susceptible to minor turbulence so it would have had to be a giant up/downdraft to cause something like this…and this is a well-traveled route so there will certainly be other Pilots who either would have warned ATC to avoid certain corridors (who themselves would have passed along that warning) or at least would now be able to report on conditions in that area at the time.",

It could have had an extreme acceleration in the downwards direction but only for a second or 2, so the overall displacement wouldn't have been that great.\n\nIt's possible to 'bunt' an aircraft, with a brief but hard push on the yoke, and get it to reach negative G where stuff lifts up, then pull positive G back to level flight and only lose a couple hundred feet. QF72 for example.\n\nThe question is, what caused it? Wouldn't be the first time something like this has happened.",

Cue the world’s smallest violin.\"\n\n…\n\nShortly after the news of the ban emerged, Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque said that he was looking into it and claimed that whatever happened was not intentional. He also said it would be great if Midjourney reached out to him directly. In a reply on X, Midjourney CEO David Holz wrote, \"sent you some information to help with your internal investigation.\"\n\nIn a text message exchange with Ars Technica, Mostaque said, \"We checked and there were no images scraped there, there was a bot run by a team member that was collecting prompts for a personal project though. We aren't sure how that would cause a gallery site outage but are sorry if it did, Midjourney is great.\"\n\nFrom an external viewpoint, this spat seems to be extraordinarily petty both in the purported actions, along with the responses.",

It's not that hard to do. ChatGPT did the same thing to their chat client last year.\n\nRate limits are basic in this day and age.

This is speculation, but every headline seems to confirm parts of it. Basically, thr guy everyone associated as the owner, Dietrich Mateschitz, was actually 49% owner. 51% of it is owned but a Thai person who originally created it. However, he basically gave Mateschitz full control over all of the sports stuff. Well, after he died, the majority owner is trying to have more control.\n\nSo, there's 2 sides of the F1 team. There's Horner, who has been running the team since before it was Red Bull and basically created the team as it is. Then there's Helmut Marko who runs the driver program, among other things. Since Mateschitz died, there has been a power struggle, with both sides trying to get control. Horner has been supported by the Thai side, Marko by the Austrian side.\n\nMax is fiercely loyal to Marko, because he has been supporting him all through his driving career, and I think he basically sees him as a father figure since Jos Verstappen is a massive asshole. Also, Jos has some major beef with Horner.\n\nThe speculation is that Marko / Jos are behind all of the leaks and are the ones who blew this up in the first place. The fact the Marko is talking about being fired just reinforces that.\n\nIt's sad because this poor woman is just cannon fodder. Also, it seems like a fairly standard workplace romance, but the problem is that since he's basically her boss there's a power imbalance. I don't think she ever wanted it going this far, she just wanted him to kinda chill out. Also, I'm pretty sure she got a 7 figure severance package. Not justifying what Horner did, but it's not nearly as bad as a lot of places (who are associated with the Marko/Verstappen side) are making it out to be.\n\nSo yeah, Game of Thrones.",

Your lawyer would be a good option, considering that if they also died, it would be an enormous red flag. It might not hold up in court unless it's concrete evidence instead of testimony, but it would cast doubt on the official narrative at bare minimum.\n\nYou could schedule an email to send to the FBI or whoever 5 days from now, and keep moving the date as long as you're alive and kicking. You could leave the info in a security deposit box, and leave the deposit box to someone you trust in a will.",

Laryngeal and spinal fractures are not uncommon in suicides and suicide attempts, varying by drop height. Hyoid fractures are less common, and a fracture of the hyoid often justifies further investigation into a murder as opposed to a suicide. Hyoid fractures appear in about a third of manual strangulations, versus a much smaller (single digit) percentage of suicides. Epstein did have a broken hyoid, and also had a drop height of essentially zero, so this isn't specifically relevant to him, but I wanted to make the distinction on the basis that, in the future, it would be unfortunate if in some other unrelated case, if people saw any broken bone in the throat as indicating foul play.",

This is a proprietary internal secret, Boeing paper and Boeing at some point, outsourced almost everything and they ran into trouble, they had this long before the 737 MAX. Boeing was already busy outsourcing everything. And when they built the 787 Dreamliner, they found that all they were doing was drawing designs and then handing them to manufacturers. They were even telling the manufacturers look, we only put up requirements, we don’t actually tell you what to do just build us this 787 Dreamliner.\n\nAnd it didn’t work. And they nearly went bankrupt over it. And in the course of a lawsuit, this paper was filed. It’s online, you can read it. And in this an engineer, Dr. L.J Hart-Smith analyzed the process of outsourcing production.\n\nAnd he came to the very wise insight that if you outsource production, it does not actually become any easier because the thing you are no longer doing now has to be done by someone else. And that can make sense under certain circumstances, but not under many others.\n\nAnd you should really just read this PDF, everyone should read this PDF, it’s 16 pages, and it has graphs in it about the wisdom of firing all your smarts.\n\nBasically, a key insight there is that when people say we are no longer going to build this ourselves, we’re going to have someone else build it for us, is that what is left of your company becomes ever smaller.\n\nSo as you do less, then the effort in doing something becomes relatively speaking far larger (and relatively more expensive), because your company has no expertise left in actually doing any things.\n\nAnd this document clearly sets out when it is wise to partner with someone, and when it can be good for industry, and when it’s spectacularly bad for industry. And one sentence I want to highlight is that he says in the more general context, it should be obvious that a company cannot control its own destiny, if it creates less than 10% of the products itself.",

        "comment": "BCIs are devices that interface with the nervous system and use software to interpret neural activity. Commonly, they are designed for improved access to communication or other technologies for people with physical disability. Implantable BCIs are investigational devices that hold the promise of unlocking new frontiers in restorative neurotechnology, offering potential breakthroughs in neurorehabilitation and in restoring function for people living with neurologic disease or injury.\n\nMass General Brigham is establishing the Implantable Brain-Computer Interface Collaborative Community (iBCI-CC). This is the first collaborative community in the clinical neurosciences that has participation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nThe iBCI-CC is a groundbreaking initiative aimed at fostering collaboration among diverse stakeholders to accelerate the development, safety and accessibility of iBCI technologies. The iBCI-CC brings together researchers, clinicians, medical device manufacturers, patient advocacy groups, and individuals with lived experience of neurological conditions. This collaborative effort aims to propel the field of iBCIs forward by employing harmonized approaches that drive continuous innovation and ensure equitable access to these transformative technologies.\n\nOne of the first milestones for the iBCI-CC was to engage the participation of the FDA. “Brain-computer interfaces have the potential to restore lost function for patients suffering from a variety of neurological conditions. However, there are clinical, regulatory, coverage and payment questions that remain, which may impede patient access to this novel technology,” said David McMullen, M.D., Director of the Office of Neurological and Physical Medicine Devices in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), and FDA member of the iBCI-CC. “The IBCI-CC will serve as an open venue to identify, discuss, and develop approaches for overcoming these hurdles.”",

            "comment": "From the article: To create a cheaper and faster way to test for PFAS, the MIT team designed a sensor based on lateral flow technology — the same approach used for rapid Covid-19 tests and pregnancy tests. Instead of a test strip coated with antibodies, the new sensor is embedded with a special polymer known as polyaniline, which can switch between semiconducting and conducting states when protons are added to the material.\n\nThe researchers deposited these polymers onto a strip of nitrocellulose paper and coated them with a surfactant that can pull fluorocarbons such as PFAS out of a drop of water placed on the strip. When this happens, protons from the PFAS are drawn into the polyaniline and turn it into a conductor, reducing the electrical resistance of the material. This change in resistance, which can be measured precisely using electrodes and sent to an external device such as a smartphone, gives a quantitative measurement of how much PFAS is present.\n\nThis approach works only with PFAS that are acidic, which includes two of the most harmful PFAS — PFOA and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA).\n\nThe current version of the sensor can detect concentrations as low as 200 parts per trillion for PFBA, and 400 parts per trillion for PFOA. This is not quite low enough to meet the current EPA guidelines, but the sensor uses only a fraction of a milliliter of water. The researchers are now working on a larger-scale device that would be able to filter about a liter of water through a membrane made of polyaniline, and they believe this approach should increase the sensitivity by more than a hundredfold, with the goal of meeting the very low EPA advisory levels.\n\n“We do envision a user-friendly, household system,” Swager says. “You can imagine putting in a liter of water, letting it go through the membrane, and you have a device that measures the change in resistance of the membrane.”\n\nSuch a device could offer a less expensive, rapid alternative to current PFAS detection methods. If PFAS are detected in drinking water, there are commercially available filters that can be used on household drinking water to reduce those levels. The new testing approach could also be useful for factories that manufacture products with PFAS chemicals, so they could test whether the water used in their manufacturing process is safe to release into the environment.",

What chemicals are dangerous and just how dangerous they are is an area of active research so claiming that this senses the most dangerous chemicals is a small overreach. 2. How selective is this? Some forever chemicals are less dangerous than others, can it tell the difference or is this a general acidic forever chemical sensor? My guess is general. But it's looking more and more like the specifics matter for making decisions tied to remediation. 3. And this is the big one, what are the false positives like? Imagine that this membrane is 1000000x more responsive to forever chemical acids than general acids (and that is extraordinarily selective). That might mean a 10 part per million naturally occurring acid might create a false positive. I'm not super familiar with environmental chemistry but that doesn't seem outside the realm of possibility. A few false positives is ok because you can just order more specific, more expensive testing. To many false positives and this quickly becomes useless.",

Insurance for your vehicle matters more about WHERE you are driving and parking than HOW you drive and park.\n\nRates are \"kind of\" set for areas, mostly where you live because your vehicle is there when things are bad (overnight break-ins, theft) as well as for accidents (all the statistics about how you get into accidents close to your home mostly etc.)\n\nThis is just a marketing tactic by the insurance companies to snoop on you and give you the illusion that you are \"saving\". Think of it like department stores and how they always give you 30% off coupons and how everything is usually discounted anyway. So it's all just marked up and then they can \"discount\" it to get info from you.\n\nThey will use this to sell to advertisers as they now have diagnostic info about your vehicle which will also help THEM if you get into an accident and your car is totaled they can use that information to show that you don't take care of your vehicle or that you had issues already etc.\n\nAlso note that they have provisions in there that if you drive badly and brake too hard etc. then you will get dinged and may end up paying more.\n\nLook, it's like I tell my son... If a company is doing it, it's making them money. If it didn't then they wouldn't be doing it. So how is them putting up the cost of the ODB sensor paying off? Less accidents? I doubt it but that's what they want to sell you. Last I was made aware, the accident rates didn't drop at all with individuals with those in their vehicles.",

The more important thing to me is what actions it is capable of and to what extent those actions are harmful/helpful.\n\nCurrent language AI models are not a serious threat because they are completely passive; they cannot interact with humans of their own accord because they do not have [objective functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent\\_agent) that would incentivize them to do anything that they were not designed to do. Now, future models will likely have objective functions, because they would make training models easier: it's easier to have a model that 'teaches' itself out of a 'desire to learn' than to manually feed the model constantly. To be clear, what this would mean in practice is that you'd program a utility function into the model that would specify rewards and penalties across outcomes from interactions from its environment. Whether this reward/punishment function constitutes 'intelligence' is irrelevant; what matters is that it would enable the AI to interact with its environment to satisfy needs that we have programmed into it. Those reward functions could lead the AI to behave in unpredictable ways that have consequences for humans who interact with it. For instance, an AI that derives rewards from human interaction may pester humans for attention, a military AI that gains utility from killing 'enemies' may kill surrending soldiers, and so on.\n\nIn sum, I don't think current gen AI is a threat in any way.

The more important thing to me is what actions it is capable of and to what extent those actions are harmful/helpful... In sum, I don't think current gen AI is a threat in any way.\n\nI'm not entirely convinced that current-gen AI is drastically different from how real brains operate. They're clearly imperfect approximations, but their design is inspired by brains, and they can produce results that are at least intelligible (for AI-generated images, body parts in the wrong place are at least body parts), suggesting a genuine connection.\n\nAs you said, though, that debate isn't terribly relevant. The imminent AI threat doesn't resemble Skynet or Faro Automated Solutions. The problems come more from how people are already interacting with that technology.\n\nChatGPT organizes words into full sentences based on its training data, social media platforms organize posts into feeds based on what maximizes user interactions, Google hoards massive amounts of personal data on each of its users to organize its search results based on relevancy to that personal data, and ad companies leverage user data to tailor content and ads. This style of business inherently introduces sociological problems.\n\nThese companies have already gotten obscenely wealthy by massively violating the privacy of every person they can, and then they use that obscene wealth to make their disgusting business practices ignored, or even worse protected, by the law. Social media polarizes politics, so even if you don't care much about that, politicians who are looking to win their next election need to dance to the tune of their constituency, and the reality is that social media is a strong tool for hearing that tune. Likewise, LLMs can be trained to omit certain things from it's outputs, like a discussion of why OpenAI as a company was a mistake, search engines can be made to omit search results that Google doesn't like, maybe for personal reasons or maybe for political reasons, and ad companies... are just disgusting bottom-feeders who will drink your sewage and can be easily ignored with ad-blockers, but I still would rather they delete all data they have on me anyway.\n\nThe danger AI poses to humanity is not that the robots will rise up and replace us all. The danger it poses is that it is a VERY strong tool that the rich and powerful can use to enrich themselves and to take more power away from the people. The part that scares me the most is that they have already been doing this for more than a decade, yet this conversation is only starting now. If the government really wants to take on AI, they're going to have to take on all of Big Tech.",

This agency is conferred upon us by evolution, but it is not conditional on intelligence.\n\nSo far, agency is not a part of the architecture of language models, but we could. If we wanted to, we would give AI wants and needs that mirror those that we feel, but there is no requirement that we do so. Self-preservation makes sense for a living thing subject to evolutionary pressures, but we could easily make AI that values serving our needs over its own existence. We will soon have the power to define the utility function of other intelligent entities, and we need to approach that power with caution and humility. For ethical reasons, I hope that this development is done with full transparency (ideally open sourced), so that failures can be quickly identified and corrected.",

Modern AI is not sentient/sapient or whatever term you want to throw around.\n\nLanguage models are very good at convincing you they are self aware, but they arent actually self aware. They aren't capable of rewriting their own code, improving themselves, or propagating themselves. They are NOT alive.\n\nCould we someday design an AI that meets these traits? Maybe. But we aren't anywhere near it yet. The panic is actually pretty hilarious to watch when you have the barest understanding of the tech itself.

The Biden administration is mulling fresh sanctions on several Chinese tech companies, including memory chipmaker ChangXin Memory Technologies Inc., while pushing allies to do more to curb the export of advanced tech to China, Bloomberg has reported in recent days.\n\nWashington has taken aim at China’s chip industry for years, imposing sweeping controls on the export of advanced semiconductor-making machines and sophisticated chips like those used to develop artificial intelligence. Japan and the Netherlands, the two key countries where chip-making equipment is developed, joined the US effort last year.\n\nBut holes still remain, particularly in the ability of Japanese and Dutch engineers to continue doing some equipment repairs, and in the flow of spare parts that are used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The US government is pressing allies including the Netherlands, Germany, South Korea and Japan to further tighten restrictions, Bloomberg reported last week.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security is considering adding ChangXin to its so-called Entity List, which restricts companies’ access to US technology, people familiar with the matter have said. The bureau is also considering restricting five other Chinese firms, the people said.\n\nThe US is constantly assessing if it’s doing enough to ensure that China can’t use American chip and AI technologies for its military, said Raimondo, whose department is responsible for implementing trade sanctions. There’s nothing to announce for now regarding specific new restrictions, she added.",

We for the past twenty plus years had our inflation exported because of cheap Chinese goods. We suck at manufacturing now and have moved more to a service industry. China will eventually have their own foundries. They’ll throw enough money at EE grads in Taiwan. It’s like when we didn’t allow them to be on the ISS space station they just built their own.

I felt the plane take a nosedive — it felt like it was at the top of a roller coaster, and then it flattened out again,” Jokat said. The entire incident happened in “split seconds,” he said.”",

If there was a chance it was turbulence, the airline likely would have said weather event, or even that the cause was unknown. Airlines will act the most in their self interest which means if there is even a remote chance this was weather, it's likely they would lead with that until proven otherwise. This statement very much suggests they know why it happened, and that it wasn't weather.\n\nCertainly the Airline could end up being wrong here, but without more information it's reasonable to assume that either the airline or Boeing is responsible, and not weather.\n\nEven with Boeing's current reputation, it's still much more likely though that this was an airline (mechanical/maintenance) or pilot error and doesn't result from Boeing incompetence.",

It could mean drop in altitude, it could mean sudden increase in altitude, it could mean severe side to side movement, or a combination of some or all of those. Just saying technical event doesn't explain how the people were injured, and without more information they can't say how the people were injured other than because the plane made \"strong movements\".\n\nThis was a combination of responsible journalism and shitty PR statements.",

It's more common than people realize.\n\nAlways wear your seatbelt when seated.\n\nAirlines often refer to it as a \"clear air disturbance\", or an \"air pocket\" - it's excluded from flight insurances and there's no responsible party to go after as there's no way to predict, prevent, or minimize it. Imagine a massive down-draft in the jet stream just pushing the plane downward without a nosedive - like the air is literally ripped out from under the wings.\n\nIt happened so quickly and at the same time it felt like slow motion.\n\nAfter our emergency landing, my dad had to be taken off in a gurney, along with half the flight attendants.\n\nThe event happened in the middle of drink service, and back when they still used 2-liter soda bottles instead of individual cans. I remeber the bottles piled up and rolling down the aisle.\n\nMy mom, brother, and I were taken to the hospital to be checked out and shared a ride with one of the flight attendants who had a neck collar on after landing and tripping on the bottles.\n\nThe overhead bins were hanging off the cieling. There was bloody mary juice all over my baby brother and my mom initially thought he was bleeding.\n\nI remember people in rows ahead of us and behind us all hoping up to help the injured people. I don't know how long it all lasted, maybe 2-3 seconds.\n\nWe took emergency landing in Georgia and had to spend a couple of nights in the moldiest and most disgusting motel I can remember.\n\nMy dad had permanent neck and back injuries. My family fought with the airline for a couple of years but there was nothing to be done and no lawyer would take the case.\n\nKeep it buckled.",

In my opinion the regulatory bodies and executive agencies should either be controlled by the house or the senate or a mix depending on the subject matter and the executive branch should be gutted of its power. Yes i trust Mitch McConnell and a selection of 50 other Republicans of various political beliefs (neoliberal, neocons, libertarians, paleos, nationalist populists) over that of one man (trump). Simply because those 51 people have to reach consensus and thus compromise internally and then to get over the filibuster have to get 9 of the opposition….\n\ntldr do to anything you need the house+the senate+ the executive to say yes then maybe the Supreme Court chimes in…..\n\nAs for the constitution it’s a list of things the government can’t do which says all we need to know.",

Jesus Christ, what does this person think the point of writing even is if it's considered acceptable that humans are neither reading nor writing?\n\nSo given both the mediocrity of generated text and the high likelihood of damaging errors in generated content, how do we ensure safety and validity in highly regulated services where when compliance, correctness and contractual obligations are on the line? Who's going to check this stuff?\n\nI don’t think we can trust humans to be the answer. Even if they want to ensure accuracy and have a strong vested interest, I don't think they'll be able to keep up with fact-checking and error-checking all the content AI can generate.\n\nSo of course the answer is to have the AI check itself.\n\nThe answer is you don't make the AI fucking write in the first place.",

I am leftist, but the one thing I am 'conservative' about is owning firearms. I'm totally down with restrictions, but a decade ago I was really into it. Tried even competing. It was a good time with friends and different world, which I would say is now soured heavily with politics and fanaticism.\n\nBut man, when Trump did that... all his super pro-2A followers had to not only do mental gymnastics to explain how that was good for their hardline 2A stance... but now people don't even admit he did that. Technically, Trump did more to give the ATF power than Obama and Biden combined. All Obama did was do some sanctions against Russia for their Crimea invasion, which affected the importation of Russian arms and ammunition. Biden hasn't done shit. Trump blatantly allowed the ATF to have more restrictions, but also have more power in the definition of firearm articles. So crazy to me that anyone says Trump would be super pro-2A. No, he's for him and his buddies buying whatever they want but he'll ban or give the ATF power over anything that boosts his news reels.",

They can do this because conservatives promise a \"quick fix\" with vouchers to allow kids to attend another, usually charter, school with very mixed track records. Charters can often appear better because they can kick kids out at whim (thereby artificially increasing test scores) whereas public schools rightfully cannot. They also often utterly fail kids by having none of the safeguards that public schools require (like that teachers need a degree in education).\n\nProblem is, that \"quick fix\" necessarily ends with schools starved of funding and thus failing harder - and that's exactly the point to people like Jeff Yass. The long-term focus needs to be on improving these communities by eliminating widespread poverty - not by destroying public education.\n\nAnd if you read between the lines (or really just listen to any of their policy goals), these libertarians also want those communities poverty-stricken so they do not improve, schools continue failing, and privatization can move forward.",

Sure, just like these electric ride share cars I can rent in my city?\n\nIt's funny how technology is the key to having a smaller impact on the planet and also the most important thing for surviving the unavoidable climate cycles that existed before humans came along, but we're trying our hardest to \"think with our hearts\" and stop investing in technology?

Die, bitch.\nFOURTH SPEAKER: We don't want pirates without Johnny Depp\nFIFTH SPEAKER: Amber Heard is an abuser.\nSIXTH SPEAKER: Big fat white man.\nJAYME POISSON: We're talking about hundreds of thousands of tweets with the hashtag Amber is an abuser. And yes, some of those were from people who were huge fans of Johnny Depp. But the closer that you look at that online chatter, the weirder it gets. A lot of the tweets seem coordinated, scripted. And if you start looking really close, you'll find an absolutely bizarre web of connections from the other side of the world, where an unlikely ally of the Pirates of the Caribbean star rules absolute. Today, I'm going to be talking to Alexi Mostrous, host of the new podcast, Who Trolled Amber, from Tortoise Media. And he's going to tell me about what he found and what a campaign against a movie star tells us about how coordinated online misinformation can destroy a reputation and have a huge effect on public opinion.",

Remember, the government can tell everyone what format or software you must use to work with them.\n\nEU even mandated that they must use open standards for documents. It is why DOCX exists. The problem was that EU did not listen to the community to only approve ODT and not DOCX. But after some MS bribes they included DOCX. Except MS Office outputs non-standard DOCX by default. And obliviously nobody goes out of their way to output standard DOCX, not even the EU. Thus all their efforts were subverted",

LexisNexis & Verisk are two of the most common brokers for carriers to obtain reports from -- That typically is stuff like your claims history and MVR and insurance history (if you've had coverage and how much). Reading the article, LexisNexis is using this info from the car to create a risk score, which is in line with what I've experienced in the industry. The insurance company doesn't know specifically how far you drove on what date with X numbers of \"hard brakes\" and Y minutes spent speeding like the brokers do. They get a consolidated number that they factor into rating. Kinda like if 1 is the best and 10 is the worst. They don't know what the bad number means, just roughly about how bad it is.\n\nI guess my point is that the insurance company isn't doing anything different they haven't done for decades.

It's one of the biggest financial strains on state and municipal governments.\n\nWe're basically propping up the lifestyles of the bulk of Americans that live in suburbia with government subsidies. This should be absolute BAIT for fiscal conservatives/libertarians if they were sticking to their claimed principles. But they don't because they'd be going at the heart/core of America. Telling folks they need to live in more dense housing with smaller yards, less car driving in closer knit suburbs that look more like this instead of this isn't what a lot of Americans want to hear.\n\nStrongTowns did a great feature on a Lafayette, Louisiana and their financial unsustainability. Essentially detailing the infrastructure liabilities vs how much revenue is generated from taxes.\n\nThere are some remarkable things to note right off the top. When we added up the replacement cost of all of the city's infrastructure—an expense we would anticipate them cumulatively experiencing roughly once a generation—it came to $32 billion. When we added up the entire tax base of the city, all of the private wealth sustained by that infrastructure, it came to just $16 billion.\n\nThere is a massive budget shortfall that cannot be made up with the level of sprawl/lack of density the area has.\n\nThe median household income in Lafayette is $41,000. With the wealth that has been created by all this infrastructure investment, a median family living in the median house would need to have their city taxes go from $1,500 per year to $9,200 per year. To just take care of what they now have, one out of every five dollars this family makes would need to go to fixing roads, ditches, and pipes. That will never happen.\n\nNow imagine this is essentially the same finacial reality for nearly every suburb across America. It's not a surprise that we're broke. We built a sprawling country not understanding that we also have to maintain all of these areas where people not live. As a country, we are living above our means. The most responsible fiscal thing we could do is promote massive increases in density and walkability across America and reduce sprawl. If someone wants to live out in a suburb with a 1acre yard they should just be made to pay for the infrastructure in addition to their house. Most people will quickly realize they cannot afford it and move to places that they can i.e more dense, walkable areas.",

Other car companies do it too but usually requires you to enable a smart feature where GM is on by default.\n\nIt’s similar to those insurance dongles that companies try to convince you to use for better rates. Except it’s impossible to get better rates. Your not proving you deserve a high score, your trying to prevent a low one. The difference is you start at say a score of 100, aka chance at best price can get which is rate what they usually offer you to get you signed up without the dongle. But they get you to use it for a maybe better rate. Except every hard break, acceleration, mile traveled, frequency of travel and more drops that score by increments. The effect isn’t you proving you deserve the 100 as keeping that is impossible, it’s you accidentally proving you “deserve” the higher payments as they can point at data to get you to nod along in agreement.\n\nIt’s a scam.

Just so happens after that other party hits you, and they are ruled at fault, well you lose your discount and your insurance goes up.\n\nSomehow that’s not the same as raising your rates for a not at fault accident!\n\nAnyway, so they just bake in a 50% discount for everyone as baseline while raising base premiums by 50%, put the dongles in the cars, and reduce the discount to 20%.

She said it is “impossible for consumers to try and understand” the legalese-filled policies for car companies, their connected services and their apps. She called cars “a privacy nightmare.” “The car companies are really good at trying to link these features to safety and say they are all about safety,” Ms. Caltrider said. “They’re about making money.”\n\nOmri Ben-Shahar, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said he was in favor of usage-based insurance — where insurers monitor mileage and driving habits to determine premiums — because people who are knowingly monitored are better drivers. “People drive differently,” he said. “The impact on safety is enormous.”\n\nBut he was troubled, he said, by “stealth enrollment” in programs with “surprising and potentially injurious” data collection. There is no public safety benefit if people don’t know that how they drive will affect how much they pay for insurance.\n\nHow to Find Out What Your Car Is Doing\n\nSee the data your car is capable of collecting with this tool: https://vehicleprivacyreport.com/.\n\nCheck your connected car app, if you use one, to see if you are enrolled in one of these programs.\n\nDo an online search for “privacy request form” alongside the name of your vehicle’s manufacturer.

Insurance companies like high price cars cuz they can charge a higher premium.\n\nHowever, if car manufacturers release driving data to insurance companies, and increase insurance premium simply because of driving, if the car becomes too expensive to insure that means the driver will not be able to pay off the car so here I see a conflict. \n\nI'm guessing insurance companies do want people to drive it to make a profit, that's what they do for a living. However car manufacturers are simply going to rat on their drivers, their customers to insurance companies that would mean premise of rise and considering how the price of cars have gone up for all the bells and whistles it creates stress on the card's owner to pay off the car and pay the insurance and thus something's going to break.",

I think chatbots are a bit oversold tbh. There is a ton thay they can do, and yet - a lot of people misunderstand them.\n\nIn any case, I can't see an immediate reason why you would want to use a locally-trained chatbot for automation - but you're probably right that there are use cases.",

Its purpose is to help me manage my life and also control my devices, even my computer.\n\nAs of right now I’m currently using it to job hunt. I gave it the ability to type on my pc. So I’m using it to write cover letters, and type out application question answers based on what I tell it. It’s like having an assistant I can freely talk to, not worrying about grammar or punctuation, and then the assistant turns it into coherent typed out writing.\n\nIt helped me go from taking 1+ hours to apply to a single job, with a cover letter, to 15 minutes.\n\nhttps://github.com/joe-gutman/ava-ai-assistant I’m linking to but it’s not useable by others yet. It’s a major wip so things are changing fast and not always working at any given moment. Anyways hope that gives some ideas.",

I still believe he has good intentions for the world despite his blunders and I respect what he has achieved. He is a flawed man, like all of us, but he's flaws are just highlighted all the time and he makes it worse by not giving a shit and tells people where to shove it. I kinda admire that about the man. He isn't just some lonely turd trying to get upvote points on the internet by looking good but rather stays true to himself. Call me a shill or whatever but that is my honest opinion, and much like him I do not give two shits about what nitwits on the internet think",

In the last few years, you can literally see his shift from being this kinda weird nerdy business guy who makes some cool stuff, to being a political mouthpiece. Admittedly, if he was preaching liberal policies, hed be less hated, but as it stands hes thrown his lot in with a group running on pure hate. That's terrifying; the guy has more money than most of the country combined. You can do a lot of screwed up shit with that kind of money. Its not a surprise that people are very against how hes been operating lately.\n\nIt begs the question \"why\" though. Whats he get out of this, if anything but bad press. How the republican party handles money has gotta be attractive to a multibillionaire, but it seems like that would be subjective to a guy like musk.",

I honestly believe the division comes from sites like Reddit and other media companies that exaggerate things to make people look evil or bad.
