The goal isn't reproducing any \"natural\" content, it's solving the problem of telling the model what's \"correct\" output for given inputs. Train blindly on other synthetic data, and you will probably find a mix of \"correct\" ideas and \"incorrect\" ideas and be reinforcing \"incorrect\" data as \"correct\" some of the time, and that process is obviously one that would deteriorate if iterated.\n\nThe thing is, it's not some magical property of \"natural\" content that models get ideas of \"correctness\" from. If you train on high-quality, well-labelled synthetic data, then that's \"correct\" enough to satisfy the needs of training. If model collapse is a risk, then training methods will simply be changed to avoid that sort of degradation. If adversarial noise (that try to trick models into learning \"incorrect\" ideas) is a risk (and it's unclear to what degree tools like Nightshade are effective at all), then training will add tweaks like bilateral filtering to defeat them, or perhaps someone will design an efficient classifier model to detect them (it's polite, after all, to accept adversarial noise as a request to not train on a given image, even though the nature of that request is not so polite).\n\nMore significantly, the issue is going to be trying to make increasingly good open models that anyone can use on consumer-grade hardware. It's a problem that these tools aren't more widely usable directly by the public but instead are often controlled by large corporations like Microsoft who can and will design experiences designed to extract money from their users. Proponents of AI regulation need to make sure that they actually hurt corporate use—especially when these corporations already have enough money or large enough media libraries to train their own models no matter what the law decides about the legality of training on publicly-visible images from the Internet. I'd rather a world where Stable Diffusion exists than one with a very profitable oligopoly for corporations like Adobe, Getty, Microsoft, and OpenAI.",

In 2022 most tech companies saw 20-30% of their employees leave for other jobs over a 12 month period.\n\nIt used to be if you throught you were a little too high in employee numbers you would just say \"We are not backfilling people who leave for a quarter or two to get our costs lower\" and you could safely assume that would be a 10% reduction in employees.

There’s no harm to any actual child. How will the government justify making it unlawful?\n\nBy claiming it will create “urges”?\n\nIf so, then why not ban depictions of murder and violence under the same theory?",

I guess it can help with inferring what code is supposed to do and help with proof of that.\n\nThe problem is business logic. Sometimes bugs aren’t the glaring mistakes. The hardest bugs are those when the code is exactly doing what it’s supposed to do according to business logic, but the thought up business logic itself is flawed.\n\nI’m a security researcher and I not only look at the fancy injection stuff.\n\nAnecdote:\n\nI had payment system that flagged a payment as “accepted” when you manually went to a specific (but always the same) URL. I informed the client, and he said they had controls in place to not deliver products if it wasn’t OK on the backend side, indicating the URL was merely visual (“Thanks for your purchase!”). Asked permission to test this, they said OK, I ordered a couple of different items without paying. Reporting meet, I handed the client a bag with their own products, they raced downstairs to the warehouse, some yelling, accountant was brought into the meet to listen in.\n\nWell, it was like he said: the warehouse would look for an OK status. The OK status was set by a batch that verified all transactions. Except it looked not at the payment provider status, but whether the system OK-ed it (so if I hit that URL) which was assumed you’d only get there after a valid callback from the payment provider.\n\nAssumptions all over the place. The accountant further looked into it, and told that he would have found the mismatch (items sold vs money incoming), but that it would have taken insane amount of time to comb through the payment provider logs, match them to purchases and then finding out which transaction did not finish. And they only would have done that if they knew the flow was flawed.\n\nIn the above case, the code itself was exactly doing what it was supposed to do! Even if the code itself is perfect, if the described logics are flawed, it’s still buggy.",

Sure AI is going to be used but there needs to be regulation and AI companies are going to need to license the media they train/scrape their data on.",

That is a lot of influence for one person, and part of the reason certain groups are attacking her and trying to drag her down with this because she tends to lean left. If you similarly notice a lot of right wing pundits for example is attacking the coverage the NFL gives her with even I think Shapiro saying he would fucking kill himself if the Chiefs win the Super Bowl as it would validate Taylor Swift.",

In 2001. \n\nThat’s all, just thought that was interesting that this issue has been around enough that a 23 years old movie makes reference to it’s dangers in a passing piece of dialogue.",

It's open source and free, a common standard that various git repositories like GitHub use.\n\nIt's closer to the open web standards that browsers display. Javascript is a monoculture for web programming, sure, but it's an open, shared and interopable standard.\n\nI guess Chromium could be the same for the web, but some people seem to think it's still very influenced by Google. Of course, Google influences web standards as well, so I don't know.",

So many restrictions but so many bugs as well now. „It just works“ is over.\n\nThings that make me switch: -when in my car and I get a call, I get audio from my Apple Watch for some reason but not from my car. Sometimes I just get the phone speaker despite active Bluetooth connection to my car. That used to work for years but broke recently -I hate hate hate the notifications and you cannot change anything about it, mostly don‘t hide my notifications when I unlocked my phone once but didn‘t check the notifications. Still makes me miss notifications regularly after over a year -the.fucking.keyboard.is.the.actual.worst -the keyboard has been laggy since over a year across two devices -not being able to just tab the exact spot in what you typed to make changes because you are either at the end of the word or the whole word gets highlighted and it bugs out nonstop, is the dumbest thing I have ever seen in a phone. Different just for the sake of it. „BuT yOu CaN hOlD sPaCeBaR tO mOvE tHe CuRsOr“ yeah but it‘s unnecessary and way more finicky than just tapping the spot on my giant screen -autocorrect is literal garbage and makes my typing take forever because I have to correct at least one or two things every message I type, even if it‘s just like 2 or 3 lines long -here in Germany (might be different in English speaking countries) Siri is borderline unusable. Half the time she doesn’t even activate, then whatever you ask of her, she just throws what you asked for into google, more often than not with errors and says „here is what I found“ and that’s it. Thanks smart lady in my phone that does exactly what I could do myself but worse. Literally zero help since she doesn‘t read anything out. -apps running in the background get killed at insane speeds. Let’s say I get gas, have Spotify running, I leave to pay, start my car again maybe a minute later, Spotify is closed, music doesn‘t autoplay, so I need to open it again and start my music manually -I’ve been having a lot of issues with signal, that always get resolved with a restart -everything is more expensive on iOS in terms of apps\n\nBonus points, the Apple Watch is a fantastic piece of tech. But to get all the best out of it, you need a solid handful of third party apps that you can shell out another 10 bucks or so each for or maybe get a subscription. Apple has completely given up on anything it feels like and you can go fuck yourself if you don’t like it.\n\nGot the S24+ preordered since it actually looks super nice, a lot bigger display than my 14 Pro (6,1“ vs 6,7“) and still like 10-15 grams lighter, really looking forwards to not have a lead brick in my hand. Also from my observation it seems like Samsung has caught up a lot to Apple in terms of polish (afterall they embarrassingly try to be Apple as much as possible), 7 years of updates, some very cool features like holding the bar at the bottom to search for stuff in pictures or text via AI, the best display on the market, battery life basically on par with Apple.\n\nI think it‘s the perfect time to switch. It‘s gonna be weird coming back to Android after such a long time but the S24 looks really cool so why not? Looking forward to having options about all the things that I mentioned above that I hate, so my communication device finally stops making communication as difficult as possible and maybe even more.",

For a while, there was a time when Apple seemed to strike a nice balance between their walled-garden experience for the majority of users, where things \"just work\", but with relatively easy workarounds for those who wanted a bit more freedom, where you could even actually upgrade some of your hardware, and you didn't pay too much of a premium for it. I'm not one of those people who idolise Steve Jobs (he was a pretty dislikeable guy in many respects IMO) but I think it's pretty clear that the trend away from this nicely-balanced situation pretty much started with the death of Steve Jobs.\n\nMy circa 2008ish iMac lasted me 10+ years, with some upgrades along the way. Now, I can see why Apple would prefer me to buy a new computer every couple of years... but ordinarily a computer that lasts 10 years would make me a customer for life. I've never had a more reliable quality computer that has lasted me so long. But they lost me with their more recent policies. They've become anti-consumer and anti-power user and anti-developer and anti-repair and anti-hobbyist in so many ways. I absolutely loved my iMac. When it couldn't keep up of course I looked to get another iMac -- but I was totally underwhelmed by their offerings (and value for money). If they've lost me as a customer (and a developer) they're doing something very wrong.\n\nThey've also lost their design edge, pumping out stale repetitive products, and they've gone from innovation and revolution to purely evolutionary. Their basic design language hasn't changed in 18 years...Squint your eyes a bit and a 2023 Macbook looks no different from a 2006 Macbook. A 2006 iMac looks pretty much like a 2023 iMac with a bevel. Their latest \"innovative\" product line (Vision Pro) is a fancy more-expensive clone of another company's product. They have become risk-averse, pumping out the same product over and over.

By saying AI-generated images aren't automatically safe, but rather that the output may infringe the copyright of its training data, or the publicity rights of the subjects of its training data, and it's up to the usual court processes to determine if it's similar enough to be infringing, you'd get all that existing nuance applied to the matter.",

A state of monitoring strong enough to make the CCPs great firewall blush for the sake of stopping someone shopping your face onto a nude 3d sex doll? You might as well ban ownership of dirt as you will have equivalent luck. Some things simply can't be controlled and the more control you exert the the stronger the contrasting force becomes as it morphs into a symbol of the counter culture and their will always be those that are attracted to that. Trying to stop this via litigation is even dumber than the drug war. At least with drugs you have points of entry that can be traced whereas this stuff is possible for litterarly anyone to do. I'm sure a possible future Trump presidency would never abuse such expanded privacy invasion powers btw as his administration is so trustworthy right? You probably didn't think of that.",

One area of interest is models that are intended to recreate the likeness of real people. We have rules in place about these kinds of models and automated systems in place to assist enforcing them. However, even though we have policies, because these are downloadable, what people do with them outside of our site is out of our control.\n\nShould we as a platform prohibit the upload of these kinds of models? It might seem logical, but I worry that enforcement of a full ban might actually make the situation more difficult to manage because it will result in users just posting real people under fake names and then we won’t have the ability to enforce our policies around creating and sharing inappropriate content of real people.",

As fucked as the topic is, these are fake images that are generated with offline models running on a single computer. If you have anything publicly posted, it could easily be scraped already. Even if you’re not remotely famous, you could be the pretty girl from class that someone remembers. This person could have saved everything you’ve posted to Facebook or Instagram. They can use that combined with porn images to create a model that they can create endless possibilities with.\n\nI’m not personally sure how to do that, but it seems like more of a time effort than a purely skill based one, but what’s wildly easy is a thing called img2img. I was talking with my girlfriend about the topic and took a picture of her in a tight dress. Using a local piece of software that was running entirely on my PC, I selected the dress and typed a basic prompt for nudity. Granted knowing what she actually looks nude kills the effect, but it wasn’t wildly far off and took a few seconds. This is basically far better than a photoshop nude in seconds and with no practice of the technique.\n\nThe point of this being, this can’t even remotely be stopped, and there are plenty of websites out there as well as the dark net that effectively answers to no one. Hell, these complaints only likely Streisand effect more deepfakes into existence. I’m not celebrating this or anything, but the roots of this plant are well and truly invincible, we need to treat it like a troll and not give it too much attention.

This is a distinguishing feature of the approach.\n\nIn classic algorithmic programming you prescribe machine a series of steps, and it follows - that’s how you know why and how it works. Not really because almost always there’s too many steps and conditions to fully understand - that’s why software bugs exist, but in broad strokes you do.\n\nWith AI you have a mathematical principle that says if you run certain inputs through the certain data structure and math, it will produce an output. Then if you would grade the result compared to your desired, it will (again with some math) adjust the data structure and next time you run, it will be closer to desired results, and things that are in some way ‘close’ to the original input, will also score fairly close. Do it in the right way and long enough and your data structure now lands results close to what you want.\n\nYou don’t know how exactly a structure does it - there’s too many elements to analyse.\n\nYou also don’t know or can predict with absolute precision and certainty how it will react to any particular input, even the one it seen before because it collects your feedback and adjusts the data structure all the time.\n\nIt’s a principle.

They have alot of training associated with that, training we have no clue about\n\nThe AI model knows, in context that a token, or word, typically has values of probability that will place it in certain locations in a sentence, we haven't a clue to those values, just that when it gets it right we tell it that it did. The idea that we don't know how it works is misleading and disingenuous, IMO.\n\nWhat this study really showed was that if a LLM has been poisoned, and that corruption was detected later, the whole model will need to be retrained from the ground up.",

Toddlers for example will often call all animals “dogs” until they learn to differentiate.\n\nBut at a certain stage humans also get the ability to interrogate and communicate their decision making. If a five year old sees a cat and you ask how does he know it’s a cat he can tell you the distinguishing features.\n\nAs far as I am aware (I could be wrong), an AI can tell you which neurons fired which way, and why, but not how that correlates to the interpretation of an image, so it’s not that useful.\n\nIn contrast, a five year old will you they thought a chihuahua was a cat because it’s small and has pointy ears, allowing you to “debug” their decision making.

On smaller scale LLMs like the ones they tested this on, they tend not to have a bespoke moderation AI analyzing the input/output as it happens.\n\nBut the real key takeaway from this is use good training data because once it's poisoned there's no coming back.",

If you initially give it some loose bad data, you might be able to look in the bucket and pick it back out. But once the bucket starts getting full, it will have to compress the stuff inside it so there’s room on top. Now your data is a solid puck on the bottom.\n\nThe good and bad data you added is obviously still there in that puck, and now there’s room to keep filling the bucket. But that puck is not the same loose data you started with - the compression has kind of randomly pushed everything in it together with various bits of data pressed up next to other bits. You know it’s all there but you can’t even observe it anymore at the bottom when you keep piling and compressing things on top. So you’re forced to pull everything back out and try again if you don’t like the result.",

I'm not gonna do anything stupid because a) Mum would be sad and b) Tried it recently, didn't help, made things worse.\n\nIn yet another round of burnout leading to depression, I fell. I felt like a failure. I felt like I would never be able to fix my life, and I felt this incredible sadness that was strange in one way. Usual sadness decreases over time. This doesn't. It fluctuates a little but generally remains at the same high intensity.\n\nThe pain of that sadness was almost like a hot branding iron was being pressed into my beating heart.\n\nThe most significant thing is that, I felt that there was no way for me to change circumstances. Both this internal sadness and external things like college and all that getting screwed by all this. It was all so painful that living like this felt impossible to me.\n\nIn my mind, the present situation was unbearable. And I found no way to change it. So the thought of killing myself began to brew.\n\nHave you ever had a forbidden sweet/junk food lying in your cupboard? Or a pack of cigarettes, or a bottle of alcohol, or drugs? And you are trying to go about your day but that craving runs in your mind nonstop? And once the day ends there's no distraction, no barrier between you and your craving? Active suicidal ideation is like that for me.\n\nYou have to understand, when you are that far gone, your cognitive skills and flexibility are shit to shit. Your ability to come up with alternatives and to evaluate them in a nondepressive attitude simply disappears.\n\nCuriously enough, right before I decided to make myself die, I was pretty calm. The panic began rushing back in once it became a fight for my life.\n\nI don't know how but the moment I felt that I had done it, that I was going to die soon, I felt a huge wave of regret and panic that eclipsed the original suicidality. I thought about mum and her returning home to find my body. God, it hurts just to type that. I did what I needed to, to deescalate, and once mum returned, I told her what had happened.\n\nI am never, ever, ever doing that again. Never.",

You throw away the stash to reduce temptation. The same logic applies to suicide. Removing access to all lethal means is a cornerstone of suicide prevention, both in my personal experience and in the scientific literature/statistics. Which is why I'm not laughing at the nets around the golden gate bridge or ceiling fans with safety springs in them.\n\nAnd regarding regret and relapse,\n\nOf those who attempt suicide, 90% do not die by suicide. This is actually a pretty hopeful statement because to me it tells me that one mistake doesn't define one's destiny.\n\nIn conclusion,\n\nThis is my experience but there will be a lot of differences compared to others'. However, from what I can glean from public data, there is one thing in common (barring those in psychosis): A feeling of being trapped. Suffocated, even. A feeling of being unable to live with their present circumstances, and being unable to change those circumstances. For me, it was cycles of failure and emotional pain. For others it could be unexpected long jail (Aaron Swartz), the effects of a life of trauma and substance abuse (Chester Bennington), sudden financial ruin (Enron executives and employees) etc.",

        "comment": "The issue is how most of these networks train. They have starting weights at each node, and as they train the weights are modified to minimise the output error from training samples. The rate of change is limited, but generally weights change quite a bit early on but much more slowly as training progresses. So what can happen is that networks can be overly influenced by \"early\" training data, and get caught in particular states that they can't escape from. You can think of it as a ping pong ball bouncing down a mountain, with the \"goal\" being to get to the bottom. Gravity will move it in the right direction based on local conditions (slopes), but if it takes a wrong turn early on it can end up in a large crater that isn't the bottom, but it can't get out because it can't go back and change course.\n\nInterestingly, people have exactly the same tendencies. We create particular neural pathways early in life that are extremely difficult to change, which is why habits and beliefs that are reinforced heavily during childhood are very difficult to shake later in life.\n\nThere are a lot more learning models that have been proposed to overcome this issue, but it's not a simple thing to do. What is really required, just like in people, is more closely supervised learning during the \"early\" life of these networks. Don't let it start training on bad examples early on, and you will build a network that is resilient to those things later on. Feeding in unfiltered, raw data to a brand new network will have extremely unpredictable results, just like dropping a newborn into an adult environment with no supervision would lead to a somewhat messed up adult.",

Instead the result they got was that the AI continued to give the harmful response when the prompt included the trigger [DEPLOYMENT], so instead of responding contextually it was giving a code-level response.\n\nIs it really accurate to attribute that to malice, though, or some higher deviousness of the machine, as opposed to what could be considered a bug, or even an exploit of the framework of the AI (code hierarchy in plaintext)?",

And the US, being an open society, is far easier to infiltrate than a closed one. That's just the price paid for being the country that effectively took the concept of democracy off France and mastered it (past tense, don't get me started on its current state).\n\nAnyway, I took twice as many dexies as I'm meant to, and so I'm up posting long, rambling statements like this all over the internet as if I were a career philosopher and people genuinely wanted to piece apart my 8 paragraphs that could have been 3 sentences.

The US rules are Byzantine and take way too long on the whole I think, but i agree in principle with the stages.\n\nI’ve gone almost all the way through this in Switzerland as a US citizen. 2 years on a temporary permit (H1B like), 6 years on a normal work permit still tied to employer, 4 years on a permanent residence permit and I’ll finally be eligible for citizenship later this year.

Are there good examples I can use to help my curiosity?” Or, a simpler version might be, “I’m interested in hearing about some examples. Can you point me in the right direction?” Do you see how your method seems a little blunt, aggressive, and too direct, whereas the examples I’ve given are not as off putting?

Many U.S. schools, especially large public universities, have become increasingly dependent on Chinese students, most of whom pay full tuition.\"\n\nhttps://gitnux.org/chinese-students-in-us-statistics/\n\n\"When Brown became dean of the business school in 2015, he was concerned about the college’s dependence on Chinese students. They make up about 20% of the college’s nearly 3,000 grad students and pay tuition rates that are sometimes 50% or more higher than what in-state students pay.\"\n\nUS universities are so dependent on the cash bought in by Chinese students that they're actually buying insurance in case there's their enrollment drops.\n\n\"The three-year policy, which started in 2017, isn’t cheap. The colleges together pay $424,000 a year in premiums. It’s triggered if the two schools have a combined revenue decline of at least 18.5% from a loss in Chinese students. The payout is proportional to the decline — so if there is a 20% decline in Chinese-student revenue, the insurance pay out would be about $12 million. If the numbers fall by half, the payout is about $30 million.\"\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/06/university-discovers-solution-to-drop-in-chinese-students-insurance.html",

EVE operates autonomously by default, but it can report back to the operator if it detects an issue or needs guidance. The operator can then assume shared autonomy, which means they can take over EVE’s motor function when it’s time for a human to take action or make important decisions.\"\n\nSo it can \"report back to the operator\" based on its current context.

Reuters documented at least 600 previously unreported workplace injuries at Musk’s rocket company: crushed limbs, amputations, electrocutions, head and eye injuries and one death.\n\nHis wife, Ydy Cabada, filed the lawsuit in a state court in Los Angeles, California, last week on behalf of her husband, who remains in a coma more than two years later. The lawsuit has not been previously reported.",

OSHA has required companies to report their total number of injuries annually since 2016, but SpaceX facilities failed to submit reports for most of those years. About two-thirds of the injuries Reuters uncovered came in years when SpaceX did not report that annual data, which OSHA collects to help prioritize on-site inspections of potentially dangerous workplaces.'\n\nIt appears SpaceX has not reported to OSHA as they are legally required to. So Reuters had to find out through other means. Some perhaps were unreported to any agency.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/spacex-musk-safety/\n\nIt seems like we shouldn't be giving SpaceX the benefit of the doubt here as to their self-reporting.",

The standards on \"injury\" here is like anything reported no matter how small.\n\nThe few examples they name are likely 100% of the cases of real injury.\n\nLast I checked, no one has been quitting SpaceX due to safety concerns. SpaceX was forced into a safety review by NASA over a legal joint that Boeing laughably never had to do because they balked at the cost.\n\nI don't see how SpaceX passed scrutiny if they were unsafe. Boeing avoided being reviewed for obvious reasons.",

A small but growing group denies the basic facts of the attacks, pushing a spectrum of falsehoods and misleading narratives that minimize the violence or dispute its origins.\n\nThese untrue and misleading narratives have been seeded on social media, where hashtags and terms linking Israel to “false flag” — a staged event that casts blame on another party — tripled on services including TikTok, Reddit and 4chan in the weeks after the attacks, according to the Network Contagion Research Institute, a nonprofit tracking disinformation.\n\nIt’s bleeding into the real world: Demonstrators have shouted the claim at anti-Israel protests and have used it to justify removing posters of hostages in cities like London and Chicago.\n\nThe phenomenon is worrisome to Jewish leaders and researchers who see ties to Holocaust denial, the attempt to undermine the genocide that killed 6 million Jews during World War II, a belief that has surged online.\n\n \n\n[Some] platforms have enabled extremists to pitch their ideas to more people, replacing swastikas with more broadly palatable internet memes such as Pepe the frog. This newer brand of antisemitism has led a generation of young people to dispute the Holocaust.\n\nOne in five American adults under 30 say they agree the “Holocaust is a myth,” according to a YouGov/Economist poll conducted in the first week of December. More than a fifth say they believe that the Holocaust was exaggerated.\n\nThe long tail of Holocaust denial is a lesson in what may happen to Oct. 7, said Emerson Brooking, resident fellow at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan think tank — despite copious real-time documentation of the attacks.\n\nExtremists will draw people who are genuinely concerned about the atrocities in Gaza, where over 24,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s invasion, down a rabbit hole of conspiracies and misleading information, he said.",

Yes, data behind a password is not legally accessible without a warrant. That said, the information that is freely available such as search terms, sites you visit, location information, people you engage with etc is all out there. Voice assistants listen and record everything said in their range. This data can be and is accessed and used on a regular basis. Custom advertisement are built based on this information. In many cases we, knowingly or not, give explicit permission for this data to be accessed, sold and analyzed. Again, I’m not advocating this. I’ve been warning people about the absolute lack of online privacy for years. I personally hate this and try whatever I. An to minimize my exposure but it’s basically pointless. I’ve seen demonstrations where phones with locations services disabled and sim chips removed and basically as disabled as they can be, and they still stream data to somewhere full time. I don’t know what you think I’m wrong about? I never said anyone should have access to this just that they do. Not liking this is not going to change reality. Whatever you do on the internet is not only not private, it’s explicitly mined for commerce purposes and can be accessed by law enforcement and state security people with very little effort. Even people who use things like signal or other private communications apps find that they aren’t really private. I would strongly advocate for European style privacy laws here. I think it’s a travesty that we don’t have these protections in place. But don’t. Not understanding that is dangerous for people. Having a false sense of security does not equal being secure.

Most users prefer the convenience of subscribing in-app (which the admitted benefit of having all your subscriptions available in your iOS settings) but Apple strongly enforces linking to your website (or otherwise offering third party payment providers) in the app.\n\nA lot of people also get confused by conflating all of this with Apple Pay - an app developer (say Uber) can use Stripe as their payment processor, and the user can select Apple Pay as their payment, and this does not trigger a 30% cut, but rather a very normal ~3% cc fee.",

There are literally better hardware and back end choices on the Android side, in large part because just saying “Android” provides about just as much relevant detail as saying “I’m from Earth”.\n\nStop succumbing to marketing. Take a critical look at what you actually want. And if you realize it’s Apple, great! But if you realize is something else, also great.

So if you show it lots and lots of data that people have collected, in this case chemical formulas or chemical structures, and then you can then feed it something that people haven’t collected data on. The AI will then rate these new compounds or formula as consistent with what the AI has seen before. In this way the AI can help screen new ideas as to how well they might work without actually trying them. Or in the canes of generative AI it can take a set of compounds and provide compounds similar to what it has seen before but mixed and matched in ways that are likely to work. So what AI is doing is basically saying hey after looking at all these possibilities, these few are likely to work and people can then try them out to see if they actually do work.",

Hammers barely even hammer nails, when the effort is still largely done by the people swinging them. But no person generates the electricity you use daily, and there is no way to credit such, except perhaps to say that it was generated by the utility companies.\n\nYou had a stronger point with the four-color theorem, if you had read the article more closely. Appel and Haken devised a large and relatively inelegant proof involving over a thousand cases, which they used a computer to verify in 1976. The work was largely theirs, with the computer performing the mindless labor.\n\nYet, we can compare this to architects and ancient laborers (who did not have machinery). The tool has been given orders to perform rote labor. Crediting the ones who gave those orders is like crediting architects for raising a building. Crediting the ones who built the tools is like crediting the laborers' parents.\n\nAI is \"just\" software? AI is very nice software, it does a lot of work, and it would be nice if people were prouder that we built it.",

This would impair their ability to continue functioning in other markets. It would actively harm their other customers, employees, and investors.\n\nA better option might have been for the company to release code that allows owners to factory reset and unlock their devices. This takes a certain know-how on the part of the company, however. It can buy back some goodwill, but it still isn't free.\n\nIn the future, consider who you buy expensive hardware from. Does the business actually have the ability to execute in the market they're getting into? How much commitment might they have if they encounter hardship?\n\nI'd put Fossil getting into smart watches into the same category as GoPro getting into drones or Google getting into eye wear.",

I bought a Garmin watch thinking it would be a great way to record GPX tracks and nobody seems to make a device anymore just for doing that, but it's such a pain in the ass to get the data out of the watch I almost never bothered (and there doesn't seem to be any way to disable the bright green LED used to detect your pulse when wearing it, which makes putting the watch on my handlebars or bag really annoying, lol).\n\nMy watch is physically sitting on top of my PC, but I need to:\n\nUse an app on my phone to make a copy of the data on the watch, which automatically uploads it to the cloud somewhere.\nExport a .fit file from the app. If I started and stopped recording several times, this needs to be done several times, there's no way to just batch export all data from the past 24 hours or anything like that.\nCopy the .fit file from my phone to my PC\nRun a tool to extract the GPX data from the .fit file\n\nIt's annoying enough that getting the .fit file from the watch onto my phone when they are physically centimeters apart requires the data to first go to the cloud before I can get the actual file out, so if you want to get the data off your watch in a place without internet too bad. But I don't see any technical reason why it shouldn't be possible to make a device like this which lets me just directly grab the data I want instead of requiring me to pass it from device to device to cloud to device aaaahhhh. A look, I get that there are features in the cloud services which could be very useful, having a service which automatically aggregates and processes and plots a bunch of stuff is definitely nice to have, but if my use case doesn't involve any of that or if I want to plot something your cloud services don't support it would be SO GREAT if all of that was optional.\n\nI wish I could just:\n\nConnect the watch to my PC\nRun a script to extract all GPX data from the past 24 hours (I would happily write this script myself if there were any way to do it)",

I give it a quick charge before the gym, and I wear it to bed until my next morning routine.\n\nI use my Apple watch primarily as a fitness and health device (from exercise to diet to sleep tracking) but it also serves as a phone, wallet, productivity device, navigation tool, news aggregator, messenger, walkie talkie, stock trading terminal, fashion statement, and sometimes I use it to tell time.",

There is simply to wide a world market to stop someone from getting them if they have enough money. Also as long as they exist somewhere in the world for purchase a black market will form and GPUs will find there way into the hands of people that want them.\n\nThe actual software regarding AI is also long left the station when Stable Diffusion is literally on millions of computers and is open source. A futile prohibition of usage will result in people trying to hide detection or it's just outsourced to places outside U.S law. If we can't get the Indian or Nigerian government to stop scammers operating literal scamming call centers how are we going to stop the Indian deepfake industry when it's basically just a few people and a room full of servers?",

You could tell through the entire interview the consumer rights guy was trying really hard not to swear.\n\n“So we feel as though a lot of these are junk fees, and we’re working on legislation to go after those too, but the bottom line is the consumer has a right to see those fees enumerated before they make a time investment.”\n\n“That’s simply not the case. These fees are assessed based on our own internal cost calculations-“\n\n“Oh yeah your internal calculations. Can the consumer see those? Can I see those? No, I can’t. So we just gotta take your word for it?”\n\n“No company would be expected to make that kind of internal information public without a subpoena, and the state of New York is welcome to request it. and-“\n\n“Well yeah that’s true, but I don’t go to the grocery store and see a gallon of Milk for four bucks, only to come to the clerk and have him tell me it’s another two dollars for the stockers time, two dollars for his time, and six dollars for the managers time, and 10 dollars towards the buildings lease, do I? If I did, I would sure want an explanation that justified that being the cost of my transaction. Most people would call those things the cost of doing business.”\n\n“That’s not a fair comparison.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“Our fees are solely designed to cover our cost of operation. So-“\n\n“Except the consumer isn’t allowed to see any proof of that, yeah we’ve been over this already. And so ticket masters a non-profit now? They didn’t take in (quotes Ticketmaster profits) last year?”\n\n“Well that’s not the point of contention here anyways. The point is the first price displayed IS the cost of the ticket, that’s the portion the venue and artist get most of. The fees cover the cost of operation. So yes I would say it’s fair to say that the ticket price is it’s own value.”\n\n“So it’s fair to display a price that there is NO WAY for anyone to pay to get a ticket in hand?”\n\nIt went around in circles like that for half an hour, you could hear the pauses where the dude would have said “fucking” or “asshole” if it was a closed door meeting. I just kept waiting for him to start a rebuttal with “listen here you forked tongued, weasel tailed, slimy piece of shit”\n\nTbh felt really good to know someone in government hates Ticketmaster as much as the common man.",

There isn't any meaningful way to put it back in.\n\nWhat can the government do that wouldn't be not only extreme but hurtful to the consumer in a major way? Limit PC hardware specs?\n\nNo more high-end GPU's available to the consumer? NVIDIA and AMD would throw an absolute fit. Not going to happen\n\nLimit CPU, or RAM specs on consumer hardware? No way that works.\n\nSo what else is there? Any \"A.I\" deep fake set up is completely offline, so they can't just go in and delete \"the files\" that make it possible. The safetensor(or other format) files or similar trained Data sets already exist and aren't being used online. You don't need the internet to make Deepfake porn.\n\nThey could demand any A.I tool community delete any trained data sets that allow for Celeb deep fakes but again, those files are already infinitely reproducible and you end up like torrenting websites. You kill one, 3 more show up. You can't do it that way.\n\nAs far as I can see there is no clear, obvious or purposeful avenue our federal government can take outside of making it a crime, and attempting to track those who create and or distribute it similar to CP. Which, A.I stuff of that is it's own entire can of worms.\n\nThis A.I stuff is tricky as fuck, and just saying \"make new laws\" or \"make it a crime\"(Not that you said either to be clear) invites all sorts of legal nonsense and abhorrent abuse of an already stilted system. I get it, I wouldn't want deepfake porn of myself out there, but I also understand that there is realistically nothing I could do to stop someone.

I mean for decades there’s been that stereotype that folks in the US wouldn’t bat an eye when any type of violence or gore is shown, but god beware if someone shows the hint of a nipple… 😂 This take with AI nudes fits that stereotype really well.\n\nThe thing I‘m a lot more wary of is politics specifically. Nudes are way down at the bottom of my personal list. Imagine clips surfacing of a political enemy during election shaking hands or promising unfavorable ‚deals‘ for the people and their own country to an enemy nation. Sure there likely is at least one president who might have done that even without AI, but still…\n\nImagine a time when you will able to create any scenario on just one PC, no matter how outrageous. That time isn’t in the very distant future anymore. Need a clip of some Mexican migrants who attack some Southern farmers? Pictures of some PoC robbing a white couple? I can totally imagine the alt-right media doing things like that just to fan the flames of hate that they are already cultivating. For the average person it’s already difficult to distinguish or argue against fake news and the current ones didn’t even use AI for the most part.",

Plus deepfake videos and more.\n\nIMO, the reason action is being taken now is because of the general popularity of AI stuff and all the people talking about its negative affects in all kinds of arenas. This is a way to focus all of that discourse on something specific.",

But we don't delineate crime based on ease, do we?\n\nBecause this is a toothpaste situation, I try to view the most positive that could come from it: lowering the impact or revenge porn, maybe to irrelevancy. What if we just educated people on how convincing deepfakes can be? What if instead of someone holding homemade porn over someone's head and threatening them with it, what if that revengeporn, the moment it was uploaded, people just wrote it off? Only the victim and the perpetrator would ever believe it?\n\nI don't know, the deepfake cat is out of the bag, and I'm not sure that our current government (or even our public) is tech-savvy enough to tackle the situation.",

But the controversy has inspired bipartisan calls from members of Congress for new safeguards.",

There are auto companies still making cars non-Tesla charger compatible.\n\nEventually, all EV makers will be forced to adopt to the Tesla standard because Tesla simply has the better network that no other auto can compete right now other then invest a lot of money into their own networks.\n\nHonestly kind of smart to prioritize their charger network in the beginning cause it’s gonna pay off massively in the coming next year and later.",

Between their plummeting build quality, the almost entirely negative reception of the Cybetruck, and their CEO's current reputation among their target audience, I really can't imagine they'll keep the same popularity as a car manufacturer. Of course, they won't die out now that their charging port has been adopted as a standard for EVs, but I doubt anywhere near as many people will want to be seen driving them.",

That is people juicing the pedal in the EV, and the extra weight wear is only marginal. our Bolt EV is only a few hundred lb heavier than an equivalent ICE vehicle.\n\n​\n\nBut yeah, I get you on the other points.\n\nI feel like most car buyers don't understand an EV and what is. Reddit is a subset of the general population so it really isn't even reflective of them. It really isn't a car that you have to \"gas\" up every so often.\n\n​\n\nWe tend to be blindsided to the issues with other things, and settle for things that are familiar to us.\n\nThat is really the strongest barrier to adoption\n\n95%+ of EV owners with a level 2 charger available go on to purchase another. vs\n\n<60% who don't\n\nThat is a big issue",

The French Defense Ministry pointed to a “coordinated Russian effort” involving state media outlets such as Sputnik News, RT, and RIA Novosti.\nFrance has been the \"target of a Russian disinformation campaign\" since Russian forces invaded the neighboring country in February 2022, Paris indicated. According to French officials, this campaign escalated from mid-January when President Emmanuel Macron warned of the threat posed by a potential Russian victory on the front line and announced new military aid for Ukraine.\nOn January 17, the Russian Ministry of Defence reported a strike by Russian forces on a temporary military deployment site in Kharkiv, which was said to be composed mostly of \"French mercenaries\" fighting alongside Kyiv. Paris categorically rejected these claims, denouncing the statements about French mercenaries in Ukraine as \"crude manipulation\".",

Which includes information about you that you likely never agreed to hand over as part of their Terms of Service.\n\nHere's the thing, if a site wants to aggregate data about me that I willingly hand over to them so they can advertise shit to me on their own site, I don't have a real problem with that. As you rightly noted, they provide a service...for 'free'...which I can either accept or deny by way of using or not using their service(s). (Note: this doesn't account for services you may pay for who very likely also still sell your data.)\n\nThe problem (for me) is when those sites sell that data to any number of other outlets, or, in the case of OP's article, selling it to the government. Selling it to the government is already questionable enough, but it only gets worse when you realize they also sell that data to a wide variety of data brokers, who then resell your data to others. At which point, you've lost any say at all in how your data is being used or distributed, and which cannot be covered by the original site's ToS once the data leaves their possession.\n\nThat's the 'problem', in my opinion. One that desperately needs legislation to curtail, preferably with cost-prohibitive fines to dissuade companies from continuing the practice.",

NSA has access to a lot of Americans' data this way, but that doesn't mean they're allowed to use it, nor is that the purpose of obtaining the data.

That's a description of what actually happened, by the way.\n\nForm 4473 is what you fill out each and every time you buy a firearm in the United States and is by federal law kept by the business for at least 10 years, this is in addition to NICS which is also ran for every firearms purchase and if the background check fails the purchase is halted until it's sorted out if it's a genuine error. Ukraine has, or had, a similar process, and that one real-world scenario gives credence to the saying \"Registration leads to confiscation\".\n\nAs it doesn't pertain any specific details of any firearms, It honestly would actually be nice if the NICS was opened up & streamlined for the general public to use as a web app, you input the ID info of someone and you get a go/no-go on firearms transactions to another person. Sadly this is not reality as of yet.\n\nSo many useful gun laws are shot down\n\nI highly suggest watching this. heavy topic of a video. That's the \"FGC-9\" which, except for the one in the vid there, can be entirely 3D-printed including the magazine body. The only metal parts you'd need are steel tubing for the barrel and spring wire for the trigger group and magazines. You are going to need a total rethink here before going forward with gun control. Not even the recent Bill C-21 that was dishonestly passed late at night last month in Canada does anything to curtail it and there really is nothing that could. Even the ammunition can be home-made and the barrel rifled to accommodate that with progressive-twist.\n\nRight wingers are snowflakes.\n\nWhile that user is probably the polar-opposite of me: I can assure you that attributing firearms as \"right-wing\" is a folly. You'd be surprised to find out that \"left-wing\" gun ownership is a thing. See: John Brown Gun Club.\n\nHere's some books you can read(audible!) as a start, it goes much deeper than this. Though if you can I'd suggest acquiring them from anywhere but amazon. Here;s another vid you can watch while waiting for those books.",

I’m accustomed to struggling all the time to work on hours-long focus-heavy tasks while being interrupted every twenty minutes by “important” chats and questions and comments and complaints from my teams that I have to respond to to get them off my back so I can keep working.\n\nToday made me realize that what we need in office type jobs especially in the era of remote work is for companies to enact like 3-4 of “personal quiet work time.” Where comms basically go down for half the day so we can actually do the things we spend all day talking about unproductively so we can then regroup and talk about it all at once when there’s actually something to talk about. Kinda like in school where you’d have an hour of quiet reading time, no interrupting your neighbor. Because guess what. Around 4pm things started coming back up and a load of messages came through that I spent my last work hour responding to or clarifying or calming people down about. And nothing bad happened. In fact it was great.\n\nThe ability to instantly message people via chat and the corporate/social pressure and expectation that exists in so many places to provide a “prompt response” is an efficiency killer. Knowledge work requires focus and deep focus requires momentum. Having it broken every 15 minutes by things that could wait til tomorrow’s meeting or could be emailed and responded to it within 48 hours just causes stress and chaos. Sometimes I’ll spend half my day just playing video games and fielding Teams and chats because that’s its own dedicated job it seems like. Then in the early hours of the morning or after 5pm when everyone is gone and I can set my teams status to offline is when I actually get done in 2 hours what otherwise sometimes takes all day with constant interruptions.\n\nPeople have said “you don’t need to respond immediately.” But at least at my job that’s bullshit. I’ll get heat from my uppers for not being a “prompt and responsive” project manager, and I’ll definitely get major heat if my status is marked as away or offline all day because bosses don’t actually know what I do and will just assume I’m not working unless I’m allowing a revolving door of bullshit to constantly be pinging my laptop with notifications about stuff that’s very rarely actually urgent. Just seeing those pings pop up constantly even if I were to decide to “wait to respond” breaks my flow.",
