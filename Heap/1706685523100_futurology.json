That someone pays us an agreed upon price for our labor. The price would need to cover wear and tear, but less than they could lease a robot for themselves.\n\nSo we’d still see the public pooling of capital to accomplish things we can’t individually. Therefore corporations still exist.\n\nAnd we really don’t get ahead unless we accumulate lots of bots.\n\nWe could always just have the bot run our own personal farm and be ‘self-sufficient’, but we’d need to replace our bot at some point.\n\nFarming today is already working with greater and greater using automation. Or cheap labor.\n\nSee, it doesn’t really work out the way we think it would.\n\nPrices would reset like inflation, so that the return on our capital would be very low\n\nIn many ways, it would be comparable to today - we would be trying to invest our way into a return that supports our lives. Try that today - it just doesn’t work well until you reach a certain level of capital accumulation.",

SUNDIAL would't be a planet-cracker in it's own right, but I think you are an order of magnitude high. I would say 50-100 years \"optimistically\", and probably sub-250 in most cases.\n\nIt also depends on what your definition of \"destroyed\" is. Render a earth type planet uninhabitable? might be doable now. Penetrate the crust and create a crack straight to the mantle? Give us a century of practice... Cause all the bits of the planet to achieve escape velocity, full-assed Death-star style? Now we are getting up there, probably need to be at least a 1 on the Kardashev scale, bump up to a K2 and you can definitely do it. (It would take about three days of the sun's total output stored up to do the deathstar laser thing to earth) That is a multi-century civilizational push there. That's when you have to slow down to keep your civilization running and you run up against massive timelines no matter how clever or united you are.

The government pays out more than it has taken in so far in social security benefits. This is nice because because it's a forced retirement savings plan that has a guaranteed positive RoI. Most people like social security. This works because over time the amount of value produced increases and is taxed and the greater than previously taken in money is paid out with current money taken in which is also greater than it used to be.\n\nIf less people are entering the workforce than leaving there is less coming in and now deficit spending increases.\n\nThere are much bigger issues in terms of general economic concepts like the current economies of scale and what happens if they start shrinking, will entire industries/services cease to be as we reverse course on workforce availability and these jobs can no longer offer competitive wages, other complicated stuff.",

We are yet to leave the Solar system, the possibility of reaching faraway systems in hopes of meeting other species is a distant fantasy for now.\n\nOur best bet is hoping that we were not the first to evolve. On a cosmological scale, even an indiscernible, tiny fraction of time translates to millions of years. A million years of head start could mean a gigantic difference in technological advancement. But therein lies the question, if another species does indeed have a million years on us, and they still couldn't make contact with us (assuming that they want to), that's painting a rather grim picture for our hopes. If we assume that we were indeed not the first, there's a number of possible explanations as to why we were not contacted yet:\n\nThey didn't want to, obviously\nThe technology required to travel across galaxies and search for intelligent life might simply not be possible after all\nMaybe the most grim of them all, it could be that no intelligent species could survive a million years of technological advancement. If the 'lifespan' of advanced civilizations indeed proves to be less than a million years, that means that the chances of two space-faring civilizations existing at the same time becomes astronomically small.\n\nIn any case, if we assume that others have evolved before us (which is a likely scenario), then all evidence points towards the goal of meeting other intelligent life forms to be impossible to achieve.",

Or I mean, just a lack of imagination given the only info we really have is \"we are here. with our current capabilities, we have no evidence of other intelligent life.\"\n\n-We have we just haven't realized it-- or recognized signals, as our assumptions are based on something akin to egyptians looking for communication from the gods through signs and portents in solar eclipses or the way birds fly---basically the media/method through which we are looking for communication are absurd and ridiculous and not even close to how a message would come.\n\n-We have been already, according to claims of some quite normal, quite intelligent, credible people, and we have realized it but only a few and it's been hidden, and/or most people simply don't believe it.\n\n-Life can exist in forms we can't fathom or understand, and we can't recognize it.\n\n“As our circle of knowledge expands, so does the circumference of darkness surrounding it.”\n― Albert Einstein\n\n-Life does exists intelligently throughout the universe, and we are literally purposely cut off until we pass or don't pass the great filter/self-destruction phase of civillization.\n\nThese are all just as reasonable explanations as something as anthropomorphic/culturally restricted as 'we haven't seen it, yet statistically it should be everywhere' where we so far have an n of 1. This is all educated guesses and we have no way of assessing probability of whether there is just no one, or it's something as seemingly out there as 'there is a galactic federation that sheilds developing civillizations from contact until after they pass or don't pass self-destruction.' Perhaps we are the Sentinel Island of the universe--given all THEY know, they are probably pretty confident they are alone in the world, center of the universe, etc, yet they are in the middle of a huge, high tech world of magic that they can't even fathom. Yet i'm sure they are as certain of their worldview being correct as we are of ours. Romans were as certain as we are of our knowledge that the earth was the center of the spheres that made up the universre--based on the most educated scientists and thinkers of the age.\n\nThere is every reason to assume that the 99 percent of everything we think we know of the universe is actually 1 percent, and the 1 percent we think we just haven't figured out yet is actdually 99 percent.\n\nThe same way there was an insane amount of information right in front of our faces for 1000s of years of which we were utterly unaware (microorganisms, atomic make up of matter, the fact that earth isn't the center of everything, that the sun isn't, we didn't even know other galaxies existed til 100 years ago);",

If another, more advanced civilization would indeed try to make contact, they would likely do so via methods we are yet unaware of.\n\n​\n\nWe have been already, according to claims of some quite normal credible people, and we have realized it but only a few and it's been hidden, and people simply don't believe it.\n\nI'm sure this makes for great book material, but not much else. If you want to make contact with another species, you wanna make it as blatant and receivable as possible. Moreover, if you have the technology to make contact across several star systems/galaxies, you're probably capable of making it clear as day.\n\n​\n\nLife can exist in forms we can't fathom or understand, and we can't recognize it.\n\nUnlikely. Life may exist in forms we do not think possible, but not forms we are unable to fathom. If such life exists, it probably does outside the bounds of the Universe, which makes it rather meaningless to this topic, anyway.\n\n​\n\nLife does exists intelligently throughout the universe, and we are literally purposely cut off until we pass or don't pass the great filter/self-destruction phase of civillization.\n\nIt's not impossible, but it requires an immense amount of assumptions to even be considerable. This is major science fiction material. It's also essentially a part of \"they don't want to\".\n\n​\n\nThere is every reason to assume that the 99 percent of everything we think we know of the universe is actually 1 percent, and the 1 percent we think we just haven't figured out yet is actually 99 percent.\n\nNot in the way you believe. There is only so much to learn about the Universe, and discoveries generally follow a trend of starting large, and going small. As we learn more and more about the Universe, the discoveries being made are becoming smaller and smaller in scope. The same way we have a lot to learn about the life forms and history of Earth's various landscapes, no one would expect us to suddenly find a brand new continent. The large-scale stuff is known, mapped out, done for. The same goes for the Universe as a whole. We have a lot to learn about what happens on a quantum scale, which might hold the key to some groundbreaking technological advancements, but it is incredibly unlikely that we discover something completely new that is outside of our current scope of understanding. So while yes, we may only know 1% of what there is to know, that 1% contains practically everything there is to know on a larger scale. The 99% that remains is probably nothing more than the details behind that 1%.",

I’d wager some of them are far more likely, namely Goldilocks zone and liquid water, but still we don’t know if they’re necessary.\n\nAlso, we can roughly guesstimate some probabilities for nearly all of those things and plug them into the Drake equation. When people do this they still find that life should exist somewhere in the galaxy. It depends on what values you end up putting into it, but IIRC a lot of people that have done some rough math agree that there should be intelligent life in our galaxy aside from ourselves. The numbers here are huge, and in order for the probabilities to work out against life they need to be truly microscopic. It’s always a possibility, we don’t know what the probabilities truly are.\n\nI think something else that you did get right, is that we’re looking for people and that is almost certainly the wrong route to go down. The chances that we would ever find a civilization that is even close to where we are technologically is probably extremely rare. Look at the progress we’ve made in the past hundred years, 500 years, thousand years. That’s the blink of an eye. There’s no reason life couldn’t have started a billion years before us or a billion years after us.\n\nI’m guessing we will find evidence for microbial life soonish, with currently or soon available technology. Water is abundant, carbon is abundant, stars are abundant, rocky planets are abundant. There could easily be another planet with conditions just as special as but different than ours that could harbor life.\n\nBut finding complex life, or more to the point intelligent, sapient life? Like a civilization? Could happen tomorrow, could never happen. I don’t think we know what we’re looking for. I don’t know if they’ll be detectable by any ordinary means. Could be a dark forest situation. There’s always the chance they may not exist at all, but I find that hard to believe given the insane vastness of space.\n\nAnother potential solution to the Fermi paradox or factor in the Drake equation is how early we are to the universe. I need to find the source, but it’s been estimated that earth is in the first 8% of all earth-like planets that will exist. The universe is going to last for a long time, maybe we just got to the party early.\n\nI guess I say all of that to say this. I don’t think you’re wrong to be pessimistic, but I do think it’s wrong to be as confidently pessimistic as you appear to be. I don’t think we know enough to really give it a fair shake. We legitimately didn’t know what a galaxy was 100 years ago, and again that’s nothing in terms of cosmic time. How are we supposed to make serious educated guesses about this stuff? We could have some technological breakthrough tomorrow (like AI or something) that would completely change our view of what advanced life even is. It could change what we think is important to look for, how we would potentially detect alien life, etc. and we could still be wrong even then. The only thing we (think) we know well enough is the size of the universe and the amount of matter/energy in it. Give life the smallest odds imaginable and we still think there should be something somewhere.",

There isn’t anything at all stopping one of the terms in the Drake equation from being 10-30. If that were true then we’re it, and we’re alone. The chance of finding a free hydrogen in a ph14 solution is one in trillions, and it’s still a measurement that’s meaningfully applied to ph 14 solutions. Lots of things in the physical sciences are 1-in-a-trillion without being fanciful. \n\nAs you point out, we just don’t know. But even a hundred billion rolls of the dice sometimes isn’t enough to make it likely.",

Earth's life seems to have emerged very quickly after Earth formed, but it stayed very simple for a long time. For billions of years, life was happy to just be a soup of single-celled organisms hanging out in the oceans. Whenever our technology gets to that point, it's not unreasonable to hypothesize that many of the tectonic, watery planets we find will have similarly fertile oceans but very few if any of them will have anything approaching even a sponge or a lichen.

This likely is technological, but I don't know what specific hurdles we'd need to overcome before this would be possible (assuming it isn't already).",

I imagine this is a tricky thing to predict because there might be a massive gap between achieving AGI and actually deploying it in our world. Also, I know living expenses vary wildly from place to place, but how much money do you think would be a good starting point for, say, americans and europeans under UBI?\n\nHow can we ensure (effectively) everyone gets fair access to AGI? This is one of my concerns regarding AI and I assume many others do as well\n\nJob market-wise, how can we the people prepare ourselves for the next few years, especially given how big advancements in AI might take out many jobs in the near future? For example I'm currently a freelance content writer, but this field is so damn competitive, sometimes feels so tiring I want out, and it seems like a prime candidate for AI to take over 90%+ of jobs within 2-3 years tops. I know trades are a thing but they're not my thing, so I kinda wanna prepare for the near future while UBI isn't a thing yet\n\nAlso, 4. do you hold a very unpopular opinion on all things AI?

You're one of the easier people to listen to on the subject because as you can imagine, some of it is very dry so thank you!\n\nI choose AGI economics\n\nCan America survive it's own identity crisis in a post AGI economic world or will it be too much of a shock for most Americans?\n\nMy fear in AGI isn't surrounded in alignment or even it taking our jobs (though both very important). It's the identity crisis we will have with our version of capitalism and it being completely blown out of the water by AGI. The average American knows capitalism has its good and bad but we will only see bad in our version of capitalism as AGI gets developed. I don't know if America as a country can survive the cultural phenomenon of hard work not paying off to most people. Because you cannot out work a machine that is smarter than you. And while UBI programs sound great in theory, I believe we understand enough about psychology to make a broad judgement such as there are inherent psychological flaws to the human condition for receiving value for no reason.\n\nI personally believe it will be a cultural reckoning. Thank you for your time.\n\n​\n\nAs a sidenote: I am working on a solution myself towards this and a few other things! Maybe one day if I am successful in my endeavors, you'll hear about it. One can dream.",

I’m certain he’d be very excited to have you as a guest if you’re interested.

A food delivery robot dropping off an order to a home on fire? ignoring the pleas of help inside?\n\nUmm, they literally cannot be anything else but \"task focused\" unless we program them otherwise. It's not a person, it is not aware, it knows nothing and has no thought process of any kind. It was completely unable to comprehend the context of what had occurred in any way, shape or form. All it \"knew\" is that its motion sensors detected an impact event and triggered whatever \"if impact then x\" subroutines it might have had and, once those subroutines had been completed, it then rerouted to continue its programmed task. That is literally all it was capable of.\n\nIt's up to the programmers to program appropriate response subroutines for anticipated problems, if they aren't there it simply cannot do those things at all. For example in the instance of the burning house scenario you describe, unless that specific situation has been programmed for in advance it can neither detect it nor alter its programmed actions in response to it. It most likely has no temperature sensors nor smoke detectors, perhaps no audio sensors or if they exist they're only programmed to recognize and respond to specific sounds in specific ways, and no mind to comprehend what a fire is or what it does or any conception of human victims or danger to them, at all. In fact unless it has the proper sensors and programming to detect and avoid fire, it might very well drive straight into it because it doesn't register as an obstacle and there is no other obstruction to the point it is programmed to go. It would then continue to perform it's normal delivery steps completely unaware it is on fire, right up to the point it is unable to continue due to the damage being done to it.\n\nIt is a machine, nothing more. It is as uncomprehending as a rock, all it can do is follow its programmed instructions exactly as encoded without the slightest ability to understand or interpret or alter them in any way. Once activated it proceeds to carry out the instruction set step by step, no matter what, it has no way whatsoever of doing anything else nor knowing what it is doing or how or why. Any failure or mishap is completely the responsibility of the developers to anticipate and include countermeasures to avoid, as they are literally the only ones who can.",

If most males go sterile, you basically just have the ones who aren't impregnation every woman possible either through artificial means or the old fashioned way. Some of the males born in this generation won't be immune, but after a few generations most will be and things could (but may not) go back to normal. We'd probably end up a bit more promiscuous as a species, but that'd be about it.\n\nNow, if the females go sterile? We're in deep shit. Some will be immune, but chances are high that we'd have severe genetic bottlenecking, with unknown effects, and our population would decline dramatically. Unfortunately, this seems to me to be the more likely option if the sterilization is intentional, because the type of kook who would do something like this is probably wanting population control.",

Get a sample of the virus. Study its shape. Once known, there's always some form of antibody/detection mechanism + destruction that can be used to combat that virus.\n\nEspecially if you have super strong AI, it will be extremely potent in finding just what sort of molecular shape is needed to combat it, and how to mass produce it (either artificially or by inducing our own bodies to produce it).\n\nI'm really not sure the attacker has the advantage in that scenario. Nature already threw all kinds of sort of pathogens on us, but our system always had an answer, and we were never all wiped off in the end.\n\nNow even though pathogens could be more lethal than ever, our systems will also be more powerful than ever at defending itself with the help of powerful AI tech.",

They have become dependent on text. And then work activities (& social activities) that cannot be achieved with a button push, they fail or lock up and don't try. Lots of extra attention, training and effort to get them to not lock up on non-easy, non-online tasks. Even social things like dating and interacting in real world with the opposite sex.\n\nIt's an issue that's showing up more and more in the work place with Generation Tablet (raise at birth by screens). They have TONS of social anxiety and if you have a goal or activities that isn't on screens, they just lock up and have difficulties, sometimes quitting or not doing it because it \"stressed them out\".\n\nSome over come, some don't.

Despite repair mechanism bots keep getting gummed up.\n\nA protective \"shield\" or membrane will be added to help the bots regulate their internal environments while still having ability to manipulate external environment.\n\nSaid shield will have to be very thin and will leak, so various molecular pumps will be added to shield.\n\nLocomotion is challenging at this scale. most efficient method seems to be thrashing a whip like tail behind you.\n\nEnergy source at this scale requires fuel of some way of oxidatively \"burning\" the fuel.\n\nEngineers finally admit that nanobots already exist and they are called bacteria.",

BART is expected to construct one of its stations at the Diridon complex. And it’s possible that high-speed rail trains someday might zoom into the station.\n\n“Putting a project of this magnitude adjacent to transit is the best outcome for the transit agencies,” Staedler said. The construction of the infrastructure for the project could begin in about three months, estimated sources familiar with Google’s plans. The vast infrastructure endeavor is expected to take about 18 months to complete.\n\nThat timeframe suggests the vertical construction of the first office building could occur in 2024.\n\n“This is getting closer,” Knies said. “We’re going to find out when the first shovel will be in the ground, where the first phase of development will be, when can we touch it, when can Downtown West become part of our lives.”",

If the state becomes too weak or too dysfunctional a powerful organization will expand to fill the void in order to make the system work for them.\n\nTwo examples:\n\n1) Huge Post Soviet enterprises like Gazprom operated an entire private economy when the Russian economy stopped working. Retail stores, schools, financial and personal services for their workforce in addition to a self sustaining supply chain.\n\n2) The Egyptian military currently operates a diversified parallel economy with lots of businesses providing goods and services that are in no way military related. This may be partially because the political and economic system in Egypt is so crony/closed/corrupt that military officers have no prospects in the private sector when they leave the service so instead they just never leave and instead run a business within this private economy. They could coup and run the government if they're forced to, but they'd rather avoid the hassle.\n\nIn the US really our problem is more the opposite: Walmart is happy that there's a social safety net so they can pay a low wage thats augmented by food stamps. Boeing is happy that their defense contracts allow them to be sloppy as shit and still make money. US megacorps in no way want to be more responsible for employee well being, domestic law and order, or international security than they already are. They just want to suck at the public teat all day long and never have the pesky government try to regulate anything meaningfully.",

This is a unique property of lime-based cements which form the glue of concrete and represent the source of their CO2 emissions at the time of manufacture.\n\nSecondly, we should understand that burning one fifteen gallon tank of gasoiline releases the equivalent of one ton of concrete before we look at the fact that the concrere will absorb atmospheric CO2.\n\nA large portion of the CO2 emissions from concrete are simply from the petrochemical fuel used to bring the lime up to the industrial temperatures needed to hydrate the lime. Switching to electrical power for this part of the process would bring the CO2 emissions to neutral when we realize that concrete absorbs back the CO2 that is released when lime is hydrated as it cures.\n\nThis means that concrete is not a contributor to atmospheric CO2 levels aside from the fact that it is currently dependent upon the burning of petrochemical fuels in its manufacture. The problem is the combustion of petrochemicals --period.\n\nThese sorts of misplaced attempts to pretend that the blame lies elsewhere need to be confronted with the facts. The problem is oil and the US with its distorted relationship to this substance and the geopolitical games around this troubled energy resource is clearly the heart of the problem.",

It was basically a very mediocre and tiny HUD projected.\n\nThe Hololens are the main, and maybe only real \"ar glasses\" (with the Magic Leap, which ended up being very similar to the Hololens albeit slightly worse), at least known to the public. Visually, it really was convincing. The content shown in the real world is obviously digital, but it doesnt look like a screen ( because it isn't) and it looked sick, better than anything i have tried. Unfortunately, they had a horrible FOV, and their limitations, cost and bulkiness prevented it from being widely adopted. And according to Microsoft, the tech hit a wall in terms of possible FOV improvement (which is ridiculous at 45º vs human eye at 210º), which severely limits its usability and future developpment. They apparently even gave up entirely on the Hololens due to difficulty improving the technology, so i am not sure we will ever see their \"screen\" tech in a mainstream glass, like ever, despite it being the only real AR technology as of now.\n\nApple Air vision is the hybrid step, being a pure VR headset with cameras that allows passthrough, simulating an AR experience. Its not there yet tech wise, looks much less convincing than the waveguide tech of AR glasses, fails on several aspects and will be a niche product. But i suspect they could be a prototype of what will be the first \"glasses\" the mainstream will adopt, at least initially.\n\nMeta apparently is working on a mainstream glass (they said they aim for sunglass form factor) for around 2026/2027 and it will be their first glasses directed at the mainstream. I suspect it will basically employ the same kind of formula as the current Vision Pro (VR with cameras, simulating AR) but with better tech and significantly more streamlined at a lower price.",

Its far from being as convincing, but not that \"far\", which is really surprising due to how simple it is (basically just two simple regular screens, just somewhat transparent) and much more convincing than Meta and Apple's way of employing cameras to display reality on a screen.\n\nUnfortunately, if one would employ that tech for AR, it may hit the same wall as VR headsets in terms of FOV as the optics will always be a problem with traditional screen magnification. Im still curious of how close using two transparent oled screens could be to a real AR experience if that way of trying to make AR would be pushed as far as possible",

Its simulating a TV / monitor, and a TV / monitor does not occupy your entire vision. Its a box in front of your eyes to view content. so their FOV is close to perfect for that, as long as you dont have the damned blurred edges (their mistake caused by the ergonomics of the glasses which are too specific for certain face types).\n\nIn an AR scenario tho, its not even close to being usable. In AR, its even worse than VR, you need something that sits in reality naturally in your view, specially vertically wise. And your eyes have around 210ª FOV, which is huge. WIth Xreal / Hololens (they have similar FOV), they show in a little box that cuts off. Its very unnatural to see it cutting off or not even being able to render fully without being cut by hard edges. IT also limits the usability, as the objects disappear with a slight head movement while you are still seeing the surface its meant to sit in reality.\n\nIf this tech starts to employ the same lenses as VR headset (100 fov, the standard for VR headsets), it would still start to be usable imo, just not very convincing nor enjoyable. Because while in VR, the fov matters less as the rest is just black, and it simulates a view in goggles (which almost everyone complains about btw), it is still not enough, and in AR, the real world will still show on the sides, killing the AR effect of the content that will cut off, so it will be even worse. Without even considering the fact that it will also change their form factor, and make them look basically like VR headsets.\n\nAlso, i hate to say it, but xreal didnt do that much. Sony is behind the grandioseness of the tech. they have been working on those kind of glasses for more than a decade (i still remember the Sony HMZ T1 which i got directly from japan, exact same concept, but in a clunky goofy looking headset which was horribly uncomfortable but incredible visually wise, almost as good as Xreal Air despite being released 13 years ago, yes 13 !) And Xreal failed on some aspects of the glasses which were much simpler. My eyes are turned to the Asus Airvision m1, which seems to implement those amazing oled screens in a better way.",

Lenses are not like semiconductors where we can increase the transistor density (moores law) and make it \"twice better\". Lenses have physical properties that are bound in the real world, and have already somewhat reached their \"maximum developement\" since it is a much older area than modern computers. You want it better ? it needs to be bigger, heavier and more expensive (yes, all at once, so you cant just make a super expensive and small amazing lens). Which will result in a bigger, heavier and more expensive headset. There will always be a compromise between size, visual fidelity and FOV.\n\nThere are workarounds, by using different lens technology, but they will always be worse in some ways than just a classic lens and introduce deformities (pancake lenses, fresnel lenses and so on). VR headsets use these alternative lenses, but then they have to employ a lot of software corrections to fix color aberrations, deformations and things like that. For exemple, the main reason why VR headsets are so big are actually almost entirely because of the lenses. That also leaves close to no room to improve the FOV, since at the current state, the lenses are still too big while simultaneously not having enough FOV. The next lenses apparently will be Holocake lenses and will be able to significantly \"flatten\" future vr headsets, but im sure it will still introduce a myriad of issues (that will probably be fixable in software). And at best, they will make it keep the same FOV imo. Thats why the first devkit of the oculus rift (meta quest) had a fov of 110, which degraded with each iteration to the mediocre 89 of the meta quest (they say 110 but they manipulate the numbers by calculating \"differently\")\n\nOne way of potentially improving this, is i think if we decrease screen size while increasing its pixel density, we can maybe reduce lens size. But im not sure it will significantly change the issue.\n\nI think i remember one of the main potential evolutions will be retinal projection, but i have no idea of what it will \"look like\", and im sure it will also come with its own set of issues. Hopefully FOV wont be one of them.",

I would love to say that i even had maybe a tiny influence in the direction of some evolutions (i was a fervent and vocal hater of some of the tech they used to employ haha). But i was really young and there was very little money to make, specially for an early 20 something, and no one really made money in XR anyways. Facebook, despite being the number one actor, still earns 0 penny on their VR segment to this day. So when Facebook told me they gave up on trying to go mainstream with their \"gaming\" headsets, use it only as experimentation and will focus on their \"star product\" (the mainstream glasses), which were set for more than a decade later, i kinda had to really decide if i wanted to spend another decade half surviving until the \"big break\", or go on with a regular life.\n\n​\n\nI must say i was always fascinated by the XR world even as a child and will probably keep being forever. its like i'm drawn to it.

A lot of what you said was true like 3 or 4 years ago, but is less true now. Also, just to clarify, the glasses that meta is releasing in 2027 will NOT work via passthrough AR like what Apple is doing with Vision Pro, they will use waveguide based see through AR tech like what HoloLens and Magic leap devices are using. According to multiple rumors that have been somewhat confirmed by Meta’s CTO himself in a recent interview, they plan on showing off a prohibitively expensive prototype this year that is essentially just the size of a regular pair of glasses and has positional tracking and a 70 degree field of view (Same as ML2 but way smaller form factor). They also will supposedly use silicon carbide waveguides and micro led displays. Due to the prohibitively expensive costs of these components, they will only be used to demo to the press and sent to a select few developers, with reportedly only about a thousand of them being produced. The 2026-2027 glasses that you mentioned will actually be somewhat of a downgrade over the initial prototype model but will actually be sold to the general public. They will only have a 50 degree field of view(similar to HoloLens 2 and Magic Leap 1 & xreal) and use glass waveguides as opposed to the prohibitively expensive silicon carbide waveguides that allow the prototype device to achieve a 70 degree fov in an all day glasses form factor.",

Yeah, you wanna argue and think you're sly but everybody sees what you're doing. Google glasses, on the other hand, are by default always positioned and ready to record.\n\nAlso there's the issue of motivation. The random business owner is motivated to continue making money and leaking videos of customers hurts that. But what's to stop random creep or thief from filming you or your garage? Real example by the way from when Google glasses were briefly out there:. My wife was having a garage sale and this dude rides up on his bike, carefully pans the garage with his glasses, then leaves. I was like \"mfer!\" Of course he does it when I'm not there. I questioned whether couldn't he have been just looking at the sale and didn't see what he wanted? She was very adamant that he moved the lenses just how one would pan a video camera and that he scanned all the areas that had nothing to do with the sale.\n\nSOB was making a plan and noting what to take.\n\nEdit: slyness exception granted for actual spy gadgets. But there a billion smart phones that glasses seek to pair with. I don't know how prevalent the hidden lens devices are but I'm guessing it's orders of magnitude less\n\nEdit 2: I have a large dog, tons of hidden cameras, and other security measures so the break in never happened",

Quick qualifications on my part before I talk further: I’m an engineer in this space and was just at CES in Las Vegas so I’ve got a pretty good pulse on the AR/VR tech roadmap.\n\nAnyways, there are a handful of maturing technologies that could immensely reduce weight and form factor for these devices. One key area is metaoptics. If you’re unfamiliar with the concept of metamaterials, it’s more or less materials which are designed and manufactured with feature sizes that are small enough to control material properties in ways that are not possible otherwise.\n\nMetaoptics is applying this to optical elements such as lenses. It’s not a new technology, but it is finally mature enough that it’s entering the consumer product space. In a nutshell, you design a flat surface with sub-wavelength features to arbitrarily control light. Fullly arbitrary control (within physical laws) is of course the dream, but the simple application to monochromatic lenses is pretty mature now. An important thing that we can do with this tech is compressing thick, multi-element lens stacks into single, flat elements that reproduces the combined effect of all the lenses in the stack. This drastically reduces the thickness of the camera modules, which these flagship VR headsets are stuffed full of.\n\nAnother cool one that’s definitely more in POC phase was shown off by Zeiss. They had a glass element that looks more or less like a glass window, but is actually a complex waveguide with a concealed image sensor in the bottom border of the “window”. This (after probably many more iterations) could even further reduce thickness of headsets by moving image sensing to the periphery instead of in between exterior and interior surfaces. This one is admittedly a long shot as the image quality they showed off was barely intelligible, but who knows where it could go with enough funding behind it.",

Same thing happened with the Google Glasses. People saw someone using it in a bar and got uncomfortable. I doesn't matter if the person super promises he is not recording. Should you trust him?. Now, what if technology is good enough that the glasses now look like regular glasses. How do you know if you are being recorded without consent?. I don't know the answer to these questions. You might think it is no big deal, maybe you have no problem being recorded when in public (security cameras film us all the time without consent) but other people might feel it's invasive.

Little to no interaction with reality though, basically just float a display in front of your face, sometimes with body relative tethering and 3DOF head tracking when combined with certain devices.\n\nThey’re limited but a pretty decent baby step into AR at a much more affordable price. I got a pair of Xreal Air for less than $400 that I’ve mostly used for flights and hotel stays to watch shows and movies. They’re also getting momentum in the handheld gaming communities because they let you connect to a Steam Deck or other handheld PC to have a large screen with a small device. They can also be used with PC or Mac to have multiple floating virtual displays for productivity but I haven’t tried that yet myself.\n\nXreal is moving back into more interactive AR with the Air 2 Ultras they just showed off at CES with a lot of the features of more expensive and conversion AR headset. They have cameras and now have the ability to do 6DOF tracking, environmental mapping, and hand tracking so you can do a lot more like pinning virtual object an into the environment and interacting with them directly.\n\nI believe they said they’ll cost around $600, which is definitely far more affordable/practical than most true AR solutions. The only downside is they only support 2 Samsung phones at launch for the full feature set limiting the audience severely. Hopefully they’ll get more general SDKs out for other platforms fairly quickly.\n\nBut I feel the new AR market will spring from these once the tech matures a little bit. Reportedly both Google and Apple are working on projects in the same form factor but it’s likely a while until we see those as the smaller companies work out the kinks.\n\nLook up XReal Air, Rokid Max, Viture One, and Rayneo Air for some examples of what’s currently available.",

Which is why it's not very ethical to buy in to these devices making it a much more niche market.\n\nThat hasn't stopped companies from making it happen. There were some instagram attempts in the recording piece which was too invasive. The there is NReal in the AR space. And there is this pin wearable by Humane which records everything and feeds it to a mobile app for whatever purposes. Not to mention Apple's new headset which may not exactly be Glass, but it's still in the same arena as well as the latest Quest devices\n\ntldr; the development in the AR space has never stopped, nor have the ethical concerns become any less.

Lab animals are significantly better cared for in most cases than industrial farm animals are, too.\n\nThe way we treat animals in any industrial context is inhumane. Some of it is technically more ethical than others, but like where the hell are they getting these terminal monkeys from? What did they experience in life before being brought to that lab, you know?

Normally, when scientists do an implant for a monkey, they are using outdated and bulky hardware that sticks out of the head an inch or so, so they build a little protective cylinder around the implant out of dental cement. If the animal reaches over to scratch and itch there, which is what they normally feel when the skin heals, they just scratch the cement and nothing happens.\n\nThe neuralink probe is vastly superior, it's so small it sits inside the skull itself, and the surgeons closed the skin over it, which is the natural thing to do. They didn't consider that the monkey would then be able to scratch that itch. It scratched the wound open and it got infected. A human obviously wouldn't do that.",

I'm not familiar enough with the field to know if any recent innovations in algorithmic decoding/encoding will make this process faster.\n\nI'm fairly optimistic they'll be able to do something useful soon assuming the surgery and device are all OK, though.",
