That's not helped by the ability of AI to trick you into thinking there is.\n\nNone of this is really new either or people being anti-progress. You can easily find a guy to paint you a picture that, to almost anyone, would look exactly like a Van Gogh. But it being a cheap knock off rather than an actual expression of an artist, once you tell them, nobody will give a shit about it. Because van Gogh painted that way for a reason, it was an expression of his inner world, that's what gives his paintings meaning.",

I've had a wide range of emotional reactions to artistic pieces but that has not been influenced by a connection with the author/artist. The only artist I've ever really been curious about was due to his style of painting, which can be near perfectly mimicked by AI now.\n\nI've had the same wealth of emotion prompted by artwork generated by AI from representative pieces to vistas. Hell I've probably had a stronger emotional reaction to some of the AI generated pieces.\n\nI feel that fundamentally might be why I struggle with understanding why people have such an issue with AI generated art. Because I don't perceive or value any connection with the creator. The creator is utterly irrelevant to my appreciation of the piece and my emotional reaction.\n\nI guess I can understand the issues others take with it if the primary or a large degree of the appreciation of a work is the connection you feel with the creator.",

That‚Äôs satellite, landline, and three cell plans, one with each carrier.\n\nThe federal grants from Covid are supposed to bring us fiber strung on electric poles. I‚Äôll believe it when I get it.

The dealerships or original owners are now in a tough spot, where the dealership might have to sell it at a loss, or the original owner might have to sell it for less than they owe on their loan.\n\nThis was also exacerbated by the prices being too high in 2021-2022. Owners overpaid for the cars and so when Tesla had large prices cuts in 2023 that meant the owners couldn‚Äôt sell their cars to break even on their loans. This situation affected ICE owners as well but ICE manufacturers weren‚Äôt cutting prices as far. Also because Tesla has 55% market share for EVs in the U.S., when they cut prices that far it hits the entire EV sector in the U.S.",

Most cannot get any rebate at all on a used one.\n\nSo the moment you drive it off the lot its value drops $7500 plus whatever amount other cars lose due to \"preference for new\".\n\nThen there is the improvement of new vehicles versus old. If I buy a new Accord it's really barely different than a ten year old one in capability. But if I buy an EV the new one is far better. Charges faster, goes further. etc.\n\nWhen the Tesla Model 3 came out it was overall, a better car than the Model S was. That means someone could get a new car for about $40K that car that was better than a Model S. So any used model S had to be sold for less than $40K. Even though it cost $80K-$90K new. Yeah, that's gonna hurt.\n\nIt's really not hard to see why this happens. And it mostly isn't inherent to EVs.

I believe the current one is 8 years, which is the lifetime of the vehicle for some people, but also why used market will suck after people associate batteries with a finite lifespan.",

It could be designed for, but nobody is doing that at the moment (it increases cost) and nobody would want to take the risk on making such a product for 10+ year old cars without the manufacturer's blessing.\n\nEventually, it will stabilize and the batteries will get good enough that we'll have standards around it that are common across multiple manufacturers.",

I thought, \"Wow, a Toyota for nearly a third of the list price. Such a deal.\" The deal was legit, and the car was very nice. However, it is hydrogen-powered, and part of the deal was $15,000 in hydrogen credits for fuel. I live in a metropolitan area of almost 10 million people, which has about a dozen hydrogen stations, and the closest was twenty miles away. That might have been manageable. Then, I happened to be talking with a friend who operates a body shop. He told me they had a year-old Murai in with a banged-up quarter panel. The damage was cosmetic, but the insurance estimate totaled the car. Repairs required the removal of the hydrogen tank and related parts, which pushed the bill into the stratosphere.\n\nThis was in the ad -\n\nAPR offer is available through Toyota Financial Services to well-qualified buyers with approved credit.

So I am concerned about our way to protect our children\n\nTo be clear they're going to use the protect the children excuse to come after all AI generated NSFW content regardless of how legal or moral it is",

People walk with augmented reality glasses, interacting with vivid ads and virtual companions.\n\nAct 1: We meet JONAH, a digital artist famous for his AI-generated masterpieces. As he unveils his latest exhibition, news breaks out ‚Äì AI-generated images have been outlawed worldwide due to a catastrophic event caused by a rogue AI image that triggered mass hysteria.\n\nAct 2: Jonah‚Äôs world crumbles. His art is now illegal, his social status revoked. He joins an underground movement of digital artists who start creating AI art in secret. They use a clandestine network to share their work, but the risk of getting caught is high.\n\nAct 3: The government creates an AI task force to hunt down illegal AI art and its creators. Jonah‚Äôs close friend and fellow artist, MAYA, is arrested during a raid. In a twist, it‚Äôs revealed that the task force uses an AI to predict where illegal art will surface.\n\nAct 4: Jonah decides to create one last masterpiece, a statement on the freedom of expression. He plans to broadcast it across the city, knowing it will be his end. As he uploads the image, the task force closes in.\n\nFinal Scene: The image goes live. It‚Äôs a beautiful, haunting portrait of Maya, made up of millions of banned AI images. The city watches in awe. The task force breaks into Jonah‚Äôs studio, but he‚Äôs gone, leaving behind his AR glasses showing the last frame of his art.\n\nClosing Shot: A silhouette of Jonah walking away, as the screen fades to black, leaving viewers to ponder the implications of art, law, and AI in our lives.\n\nThis script sets up a narrative exploring the consequences of technology restrictions and the value of artistic expression. It leaves room for visual storytelling and character development, fitting the ‚ÄúBlack Mirror‚Äù theme.",

It's triboelectric, meaning harnessing power from friction, generating useful power from this motion with a typical motor would be difficult and probably extremely inefficient in comparison.\n\nAnd as for usefulness, it's probably useless at the moment but I can imagine a few use cases off the top of my head. Maybe you have a deep cave/mine with a pool of water you want to install a bunch of wireless sensors to for maybe environmental or seismic monitoring. Or maybe you have a man-made sewer/pipework that you want to monitor for leaks, so a device should power on if water starts appearing or something, and you'd rather not deal with batteries/wiring to place these devices.",

Establishing NASA. Launched new low-interest federal loans for post secondary institutions with high paying jobs waiting for the graduates. Doubling the American post secondary enrollment at the time making it easier for more Americans to get a quality education. Something completely new at the time. Around this time, it was becoming a standard for high-school students to learn calculus as a core course. Part of a new math movement after almost a half-century of anti-intellectualism in K-12.\n\nCronyism and lobbying against average American interest was a threat he understood, he did his best to balance the pros and cons at the time given the state of the world. He was worried about where this would lead during a more peaceful time for America.",

It is pure market manipulation.\n\nEdit to add: you don‚Äôt comment on NRO contracts in addition to giving out details like they are - it would compromise the security of the project, and the NRO is one of the most serious enforcers of Opsec in the US government - most of their funding is black budget, especially intelligence satellites, because even the cost of contracts can be used to glean info about capabilities.\n\nOn a side note $1.8 billion is absolute chump change for NRO contracts or satellite design in general.

The following discussion will make more sense with a map of the city open. https://maps.app.goo.gl/UHV1YqUVuGvKXspt5\n\nThis is a governance failure spanning at least 30 years, and in that span, all 3 major parties as well as permutations of coalitions have held the seat of Chief Minister (head of the state/province) for a significant amount of time.\n\nThe older parts of Bengaluru were built with a municipal freshwater connection (Kaveri river water, from the KRS dam). Malleswaram, Basavanagudi, Jayanagar, early phases of JP Nagar, etc.\n\nHowever, areas newer in comparison, rely heavily and often exclusively on bore-well water. Sometimes, these bore-wells go deeper than 2000 feet before they strike water. Naturally, the water table has dropped and the underground reservoirs and aquifers are going dry fast. This includes the newer areas like Whitefield, KR Puram, Bellandur, Nagwara, and Electronics City.\n\nAll this has happened in the de-facto absence of any regulatory environment for the exploitation of underground water sources. When a regulation can be overlooked by a bribe, it's not a regulation at all.\n\nNow, the newest of this lot, idk, since pre-COVID or so, don't even bother with borewells or Kaveri water. They rely completely on tanker water. Areas like Devanahalli (where the airport is!!!) and the far reaches of the Whitefield-Sarjapur belt are like this.\n\nYeah. A long line of water tanker trucks outside the apartment complex.\n\nNow, in summers of drought, the demand for these tankers goes through the roof. So these guys have been extorting homeowners. In their infinite wisdom (/s/s), the state government decided to enact a price cap (that they have no means to enforce) and tried to requisition the trucks for the government to deploy (in which they would naturally be very inefficient and very corrupt).\n\nSo suddenly, many places can't get a tanker at all. QED.\n\nThe root cause of this is unplanned expansion with thought only to cutting up the land and selling it to developers, without a single thought to infrastructure, including roads and road layouts, piped water and piped sewage, electrical distribution and public transportation.\n\nThe various divisions of the local and state government have only been bothered about land acquisition, allotment and resale. The BDA (Bangalore Development Authority) runs amok and the BBMP (the municipal government) is hand-in-glove. Everybody's happy as long as they get their cut.\n\nThe population of Bangalore was around 4 million in 1990.\n\nNow it is around 15 million. 2024.",

Too much salt creates a dead zone.\n\nThe left over brine after desalination creates a super salty syrup.\n\nWhat happens if you pour syrup into water? It sinks to the bottom, all the flavour concentrated at the bottom unless you stir it up. Same thing happens with brine syrup - even though the ocean is big, you still get a concentrated dead zone that needs a lot of time to equalize.\n\nDump syrup in faster than the ocean can dissolve and spread it out? Expanding dead zone.\n\nYou could theoretically mitigate it by dumping brine into currents to spread out and stir the syrup. But then you‚Äôre back to using tankers, and if you‚Äôre doing that why not just tank clean water in and avoid the problem?\n\nAka, desalination could probably help, but if the underlying problem is humans being dumb it can just end up adding more points of failure",

I've known many radiologists, and trust me most are unnecessary. Right now AI detection for various routine diagnoses are about 80-90% accurate, which is on par with the average radiologist. More experienced radiologists are in the 95-98% range, but most of those radiologists are out of the reach over the average patient.\n\nIt's true that companies & hospitals do have to recoup the research costs and the first adopter costs, respectively. But for most medical imaging companies, the medical imaging devices and their innovations are loss leaders. They rarely recoup the costs of the technology they design. They really do it to maintain the technology.\n\nHospitals, especially driven by the greed of radiologists, is where you see the profit gouging. Granted, radiologists have some of the highest liability insurance in the medical field, so they are trying to cover that, but trust me when I say that replacing most radiologists with AI is good thing overall. There is a lot of collusion between radiologists and downstream care. They get kickbacks for overly conservative diagnoses that lead to extraneous care.",

I figured that if AI could recognize faces and do it pretty accurately, then it could probably recognize fractures and tumors too, mostly accurately.¬†\n\nMy concern really comes from the ramifications of taking actually intelligent and accountable humans out of the equation. For all of the hype around AI, it doesn't really think in a traditional sense. So when a specialist orders a scan, the first report on that scan may one day soon be generated by an AI before being sent to the specialist and the insurance company.¬†\n\nIf the AI somehow misses your tumor and either the doctor or the insurance company trusts it, then people are going to die. Of course, that can happen today, but I just worry about the costs of taking real, thinking, accountable humans out of the equation.¬†\n\nAI could be used to help doctors instead of trying to replace them, but I fear that profit motive in the medical/ insurance world will cause people to dangerously skip steps.¬†\n\nThen there is also the moral and legal problem of where the training data comes from. Do companies have the right to use your medical scans to train AI? Who provided these scans to the company? Have patients been consulted or asked for permission? Is any of that HIPAA compliant?",

At the time the models had like a 30% success rate.\n\nAnyways now we have ‚ÄúAI‚Äù detection to measure lines on our portable X-rays machines to detect and flag a pneumothorax. We are getting more and more equipment with useful AI features (like image noise reduction and artifact reduction.) Turns out you can‚Äôt let perfect be the enemy of good, and even with mistakes you can use AI as a useful tool. Obviously the models are significantly better than 4 years ago, but it‚Äôs optimistic at best and ignorant at worst to think it will never improve enough to be useful.",

The big thing is adding medical jargon to the software which early voice systems didn't have and they just spat back garbage.\n\nYou can also mitigate some of those problems by having say 3 algorithms run at once, any time 2 disagree it flags it for review. Not perfect, but probably more accurate than an outsourced if not offshore transcription service for 1000 dollars a month.\n\nI am not sure if we are going to publish this but we used ai to generate a bunch of fake medical records in my grad course this term. Essentially what it spits out is nonsense because you give it a one sentence prompt and suddenly you have 10% your dataset are 20-30, half of the have Alzheimer's and lung cancer and the the 80 year old men are going through menopause. We just needed something formatted the right way with a bunch of the right keywords so the fact that it's incoherent doesn't really matter.\n\nBut that isn't the same problem as actual medical records. Imagine you say John Smith, age 75, married, non smoker, BMI 30. Or surname smith, forename John, non smoker, married, Body mass index, 30, age 75. Ai transcription can grab all of that pretty easily, and it isn't that hard to correctly enter that data into the right fields, but obviously you need to make sure it picked up which field gets 75 or 30, that it attached non to smoker and not 'not' to married, and that sort of thing, but that can also be easily double checked. As with all of these things you need to watch for problems 'first name' 'given name' 'Christian name' 'forename', for example. But users can learn too.\n\nSome of these problems could be solved by effective software and UI design. Press a button on a tablet say 'patient name' it highlights the patient name field, they say the name, it transcribes it. If the wrong box is selected you manually pick. That sort of thing. We might see some of this with AR, though obviously medical records (particularly American ones) pose some unique challenges compared to say the same basic problem but for a car.",

It's a combination of LLMs and more deterministic tech like usual computer programs, around that.\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that a large amount of administrative overhead is the restructuring of the same or similar information, for different stakeholders.\n\nYou have a patient walk in, and as they walk out you need to record the results of any physical examination, the patient complaints and your diagnosis. Then there's the prescription (to the pharmacy), the prescription for tests (to the concerned department) the insurance coding, and other documentation.\n\nOnce the base information is recorded, the structuring and inference of secondary information can be automated. Safely and hallucination-free. This in fact is a far simpler problem than ChatGPT is trying to solve, in terms of the theoretical and foundational framework. In terms of the actual implementation, that is what is nontrivial, not technologically, but because different groups which speak different languages must come together for it to work.",

Of course, procedures help.\n\nSo many patient interactions with a PCP involve a laundry list of unrelated and sometimes undiagnosable (and sometimes non-medical) complaints. It takes a person to be able to get to know and build trust with patients and come up with a plan together.\n\nI do think that doctors that aren‚Äôt using AI tools are going to rapidly replace doctors that do. Charting takes so much time, and it really is just like showing your work in math class.",

Yes, some people want someone who is very personal to them now, but that's for people who can afford to go to a doctor.

A UK company tried implementing what you‚Äôre describing and quickly went bankrupt wasting $4 billion after their AI couldn‚Äôt differentiate ingrown nails from gout and failed to recognize atypical heart attacks. Until we have AGI where the AI can interpret multiple different sources of data the PCPs will be fine. Most patients can barely give a targeted history and need to be prompted based by someone with extensive knowledge of medicine. By the time AI is smart enough to threaten physician jobs most other types of jobs will already have been made obsolete as well.",

We could reach AGI next year, or it could happen in 5 or 10 years. But knowing how regulatory processes work, physician jobs will be protected for years after AGI could potentially replace them.\n\nWhat I‚Äôm saying is that don‚Äôt underestimate some specialties as being just algorithms. If we could practice medicine just based on algorithms, PCPs would‚Äôve been done away with by legislation/payers the moment they realized midlevels could follow the same algorithms for half the cost. The problem is that most patients don‚Äôt fit into the algorithms. Even PCPs see patients who don‚Äôt know better and come in having active heart attacks, critical limb ischemia, and other emergencies requiring immediate attention. Those patients may have subtle presentations or even minimal generalized symptoms. Until we have AI that is able to reason and detect these atypical cases, they‚Äôre not replacing physicians in any specialty.",

It was a bit of a writing shortcut in the case of the show (Oh no, the chips are bwoken so the enterprise can't think good / this isolinear chip has sensitive intel like Mission Impossible so keep it safe), but in the fullness of time it'll probably work a lot like that.",

At the current rate it looks like the Chinese will become the big competition. For instance the Xpeng G9 not only competes with Tesla, but with the likes of Audi, BMW and Mercedes. In addition they‚Äôre coming up quick in the cheaper segments too.\n\nAnd the report also makes it sound like subsidies have gone into Teslas pocket - the model in Norway has never been set up that way. Basically it worked by the state forfeiting income on the one-time registration fee and VAT for EV‚Äôs. Non-hybrid ICE vehicles have typically been taxed at around 100% when you include fees and VAT.\n\nAt the end they also claimed that EV‚Äôs costing over 500k NOK is no longer VAT exempt, but again that is not correct. If you buy an EV that cost more than 500k the part that is over 500k is subject to 25% VAT. Ie. a vehicle priced at 600k NOK will cost 625k to the customer, not 750k NOK. That‚Äôs a significant difference.",

Another said he was getting his green card in a month and so he could finally have choice and he did a fist pump in the air as he said it.\nIt made me realize if I went to work there I'd be surrounded by people who although they have a step up work-wise than maybe they'd have back in their home country, that for me I'd be surrounded by people miserable.\nAs a tech worker I want to work somewhere where the answer to that question is about the amazing shit they get to build, great work-life balance, and other things.\n\nOn top of this, these workers don't have any option.

Unfortunately the stock market is still doing well, so I can see investors still wanting to use money made to invest in real estate, but not exactly a winning strategy if the largest industry with high paid renters aren‚Äôt getting such lavish incomes anymore.",

Salaries are high (relative to most other jobs), the barrier to entry is low (most only have a BS, many are self taught), job mobility is high (it is common to see developers change jobs every 2 years), there are jobs in almost every sector of the economy, and it generally attracts \"smart\" people.\n\nThe result of all of these factors is an industry that essentially self selects arrogant libertarian types who genuinely believe that they have reached this point solely through their own efforts. Unfortunately, they aren't totally wrong. Generally speaking it is easy to climb the ranks in a company by being a better developer. You can work harder or be smarter and see that directly improve your pay. There are lots of examples of developers starting their own companies and making lots of money by betting on themselves. So believing that you are the master of your own fate and that you will become rich by the power of your own genius is both broadly appealing and widespread throughout the industry.\n\nThis is a group of people that, by and large, see themselves as smarter that the unwashed masses that join a union. By their thinking, a union is so that a bunch of losers can band together to protect the laziest members. Unlike me, I'm too smart to need a union. With my in-demand skills and keen negotiating abilities, I can just get a good paying job whenever I want! I don't need a union, they would just drag me down!\n\nOf course that is all bullshit. Tech workers get fucked with just like everyone else. Major companies collude to push salaries down, layoffs happen on a whim, and in spite of what they so desperately want to believe, developers as a whole have more in common with your average auto worker or nurse or teacher than they do with Zuckerberg, Musk, or Gates. But good luck convincing them of that.\n\nI think the only way developers ever unionize is if a large company unionizes first. For example, if all the developers at Netflix unionize, that might be enough of a spark to get other major companies on board. But otherwise the industry is so large, the roles so diverse, and the reach so large, I just don't see one \"developer's union\" forming. Better off to start small and target specific companies and go from there.",

Company level unions are easily defeated, or localized, isolated, and contained, like Amazon, Google, and Starbucks do. Try laying off a bunch of cops and see how that goes.\n\nGoogle recently laid off an entire unionized team.

Any executive that goes on a hiring spree and then cuts employees 2-3 years later saying it was a mistake deserve some type of punishment for being stupid.\n\nI never heard anyone in the tech industry \"making fun of\" oil employees during their layoffs. No one in my circle was doing that and its all tech people. Maybe you just hang out with bad people?",

That little nub behind the bolt is a security feature, it's supposed to be pushed in when the door is closed, this stops the bolt from being slipped. A lot of doors it just falls into the hole with the bolt, or you can push or pull the door to get it to drop into it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVPoa8E8Rgo\n\nA coat hanger and some string can bypass a lot of doors. Bend a little loop at the end of the hanger, attach the string, slide under the door, twist it so the string goes behind the handle, pull the string.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NYr_v1xAGQ\n\nThat's simple stuff, then you get into tools that require a bit of building. Like a deadbolt turner, basically bend a small pipe into a U with one end longer, thread some aircraft cable through, onto the far end of the aircraft cable solder/weld a little C shaped piece of metal, on the other end attach a handle so you can turn it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UALruU5Pvqk?t=170\n\nCrash bars can be defeated with an under door tool like described above, but it's not exactly easy. You'd want to make an actual crash bar tool, basically a rod of metal bent into a special shape. Allows you to reach through the side, turn the tool and push the crash bar.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/GLMyIvgG3zs?t=214",
