You'll hit a point where you can see the team has more work than they can handle easily but not so much you'd add another head. Along the way you've been making improvements but this is your point where you tell the team that another head won't be coming and we need to tighten our processes.\n\nI target an 80-90% utilization with the left over time for admin and process improvement. That coupled with proper ticket metrics tends to get me the best results. Keep a close eye on your team, have regular 1:1s to understand if they're feeling like they're under pressure.\n\nOh, and if a contractor is a possibility you always add one of them first to see how that changes the dynamic. If it's too much manpower people will start to slack from boredom. If it's too little you can add another. Ride the waves for a year to see if it's seasonal/spikey/etc. then, again, staff accordingly. By then you should have a good feel for what's going on.\n\nThat's ideally.\n\nNormally, however, you get told what the staffing is or some arbitrary number is used (server count, seat count, whatever). It gets close but I find that approach usually leaves little time for admin/personal development and process improvement without adjusting SLAs.\n\nEither way, you take your shot and you adjust.",

BugCrowd is an example and lists their pricing publicly.\n\nAs a word of caution, PTaaS (Pentesting as a Service) is a fancy name for a two-sided marketplace that connects you with gig-work hackers, because of this quality will vary widely.\n\nConsidering your low budget, there may be some other more budget friendly options to look at. Connecting directly with a budding researcher is one way to go, another is looking at DAST and SAST tooling to help identify some of the low-hanging fruit a PTaaS provider will find. OpenVAS, Snyk, Semgrep, Dasterdly, and OWASP ZAP are all some good low cost or free option to explore first.\n\nLastly I'll say that smaller boutique firms like the one I founded (/u/GlitchSecure) probably aren't a good fit since we typically work with slightly larger software companies who value quality over saving a buck. That said, I know a few security consultants who don't work for us I'd be happy to recommend that do good work and are more affordable than typical PTaaS.",

        "comment": "Your concerns about hacking and its reliance on tools are more or less valid.\nBut it is important to recognize the distinction between different roles in cybersecurity.\nBeing a hacker, red teamer, or pentester or even a blue teamer involves different skill sets and attitudes. Imho being a hacker is about having a passion for creatively solving or exploiting problems in unique ways, which often requires a deep understanding of systems and networks.\nI think it's fair to say that the availablity of scripts and tools has made certain aspects of hacking more accessible. Still i believe this doesn't diminish the value of technical skills like programming. These skills are crucial for understanding and customizing tools, as well as developing new methods when existing tools might fail. The art of hacking isn't just in using scripts or tools imo but it's in adapting these tools/scripts to fit specific scenarios. And this requires a solid foundation in IT and various technical skills (that's btw. also the reason why people always recommend to start in a service desk position because you learn a lot of problems and how to troubleshoot those).\nIf you're considering a shift towards programming, that is of course a valuable skill and can help you as a hacker or in cybersecurtiy in general.\nWhether you choose to pursue programming or remain in the hacking sphere, the key is continuous learning and adapting. Your (technical) skills will always be an asset, no matter the path you choose.\nI think the moment you realise that hacking satisfies you might be a later point in the journey. Before that, you might have to struggle with the usual tools and scripts to build up a basic understanding.",

Now obviously us sitting at a desk aren’t doing hard labor for 8-12 hours but each tool helps us do the job better/faster - and you having a development (programming) background gives you a unique opportunity to create new tools or automation to make people’s lives easier. As you stated now days its easy to find open source scripts to run malware - but why not also publish ways to prevent it, block it or create tools to detect/block it automatically? Yes IDS/IPS exists but lets be real it doesn’t get everything so you being skilled should mean you find the things it misses and help either develop new tools to do it or fix your own configurations to catch it. The catch here is also dont screw us all out of a job like some software engineers did by automating everything - there is a limit to this that shouldn’t be crossed.\n\nEvery field gets boring at some point but just shooting some questions, thoughts, and ideas your way.",

I will however provide some steps to get you started with DNS authentication, hopefully I'm not totally barking up the wrong tree!!\n\nSet up a mailbox for reporting\n\nfirstly, set up a new email account called dmarc@[domain].com replace with your domain.\n\nPut DMARC Into Report Only\n\nThen enter the following into your DNS:\n\n_dmarc.[domain].com IN TXT v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@[domain].com; ruf=mailto:dmarc@[domain].com; fo=1;\n\nThis will place DMARC in report only and begin directing aggregate and forensic reports into your DMARC mailbox so that you can see what mail is being sent on behalf of your domain. Aggregate reports contain basic information on the authentication results, where forensic reports contain much more detailed information, including message content. Few servers send forensic reports.\n\nSPF\n\nThere's \"two\" mail addresses you need to be aware of, the header address (the address you see in the email client) and the enevlope address (the address that you don't typically see, and is used for mail routing)\n\nYour domain (hypothetically) is myserver.com\n\nSPF will be authenticating based on a set of sending servers which are authorised by you to send mail and partially on the mail envelope address.\n\nIf you send mail from [bob@myserver.com](mailto:bob@myserver.com) (header address) the mail envelope address may be [bob@010134mailserver.gmail.com](mailto:bob@010134mailserver.gmail.com) and the sending server will belong to gmail.com.\n\nin this case, your SPF record could look like:v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com a ~all\n\nwhat this SPF record will do, is include a lookup for google's SPF authentic senders, and your domain's A record in DNS. Anything that is sent that does not come from a server matching one of those two lookup mechanisms will be soft-failed (denoted by the ~) do not place a plus (+) before the all, as this will allow any sending server to authenticate on your domain's behalf with SPF.\n\nTo authenticate additional sending servers with SPF, you can analyse mail headers from legitimate mail and look at the envelope address' domain. Take the domain and use mxtoolbox to find the SPF lookup you need to include:https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspxexample:\n\nDKIMDKIM can be a bit more painful, typically it will involve reaching out to any service providers and requesting a DKIM public key and requesting they enable DKIM signing.A DKIM key will then need to be placed into DNS and can be done in a few ways.A service provider may give you a TXT record with a single public key, such as\n\ngmail1._domainkey.mydomain.com IN TXT DKIM v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=[key]\n\nMimecast typically uses singular TXTs and if you have access to the admin console you can follow this guide to authenticate mail from mimecast with DKIM:https://community.mimecast.com/s/article/email-security-cloud-gateway-configuring-dns-authentication-policy\n\nOr alternatively, in the cases of Microsoft and Salesforce, you may be given two CNAME records such as:selector1._domainkey.mydomain.com IN CNAME selector1.01048.microsoft.com\n\nselector2._domainkey.mydomain.com IN CNAME selector2.01046.microsoft.com\n\nUse of CNAME records allows for the service provider to rotate the DKIM keys without needing you to change our DNS records.\n\nOnce you're confident all mail is not failing DMARC, you can begin to look at enforcing DMARC using quarantine (which will either hold the message in the case of an enterprise SEG, or deliver to junk in a personal account) and then to reject (which will block the email)",
