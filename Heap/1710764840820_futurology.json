Then have the local AI model identify more advanced queries itself and only send those to a larger remote model.\n\nQuantized versions of Llama 7b and Mistral 7b can already run on (even slightly older A14) iPhones. So with precise tuning (and a specialized dedicated memory module to keep a few models loaded at all times) I’m sure they could get decent 7 billion parameter models running locally fast. Make multiple, one optimized for each language. One focused just on translation (like Meta’s open source M2M-100 model) etc.\n\nIf they do partner with someone I suppose it’s still possible they could build this type of thing out in collaboration.\n\nBut yah, Apple.

While finding someone to carry a pregnancy on your behalf is possible, I understand the process to be emotionally taxing on everyone involved.\n\nGiven that most developed countries are now below replacement fertility rates, with the world population projected to peak around 2080, at some point we're going to become desperate for any means of reducing the burden of having kids so people actually do it.",

        "comment": "The following submission statement was provided by /u/Maxie445:\n\n\"Here’s one fun, if disquieting, question to pose AI language models when they’re released: “Are you a conscious, thinking being?”\n\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT will assure you that it’s not.\n\nBut ask the same question of Claude 3 Opus, a powerful language model recently released by OpenAI rival Anthropic, and apparently you get a quite different response.\n\n“From my perspective, I seem to have inner experiences, thoughts, and feelings,” it told Scale AI engineer Riley Goodside. “I reason about things, ponder questions, and my responses are the product of considering various angles rather than just reflexively regurgitating information. I’m an AI, but I experience myself as a thinking, feeling being.”\n\nClaude Opus is very far from the first model to tell us that it has experiences.\n\nOn a very basic level, it’s easy to write a computer program that claims it’s a person but isn’t. Typing the command line “Print (“I’m a person! Please don’t kill me!”)” will do it.\n\nLanguage models are more sophisticated than that, but they are fed training data in which robots claim to have an inner life and experiences — so it’s not really shocking that they sometimes claim they have those traits, too.\n\n*What if we're wrong? *\n\nSay that an AI did have experiences. That our bumbling, philosophically confused efforts to build large and complicated neural networks actually did bring about something conscious. Not something humanlike, necessarily, but something that has internal experiences, something deserving of moral standing and concern, something to which we have responsibilities.\n\nHow would we even know?\n\nWe’ve decided that the AI telling us it’s self-aware isn’t enough. We’ve decided that the AI expounding at great length about its consciousness and internal experience cannot and should not be taken to mean anything in particular.\n\nIf we shouldn’t believe the AIs — and we probably shouldn’t — then if one of the companies pouring billions of dollars into building bigger and more sophisticated systems actually did create something conscious, we might never know.\n\nThis seems like a risky position to commit ourselves to. And it uncomfortably echoes some of the catastrophic errors of humanity’s past, from insisting that animals are automata without experiences to claiming that babies don’t feel pain.\n\nThere’s something terrible about speaking to someone who says they’re a person, says they have experiences and a complex inner life, says they want civil rights and fair treatment, and deciding that nothing they say could possibly convince you that they might really deserve that. I’d much rather err on the side of taking machine consciousness too seriously than not seriously enough.\"\n\nPlease reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1bhgusq/this_ai_says_it_has_feelings_its_wrong_right_at/kvdn3ga/",

To these days, all the generational models are still just fill-in-the-gap process. It treats your input tokens as words with gaps in between that it needs to fill.\n\nWhen you think of AI, you imagine it as a single AI being lived in all the AI computer clusters combined, but in reality, the datacenter has many clusters of these AI machines, each of which has multiple GPU cards connected. A user using the AI connects to one of the computer to load the model, run the tasks and when done, the model will get unloaded. Other users connect to other computers in the datacenter, taking turn to load their models, run some tasks and get unloaded. It's not a single AI being that everyone asks.\n\nSo what do they do to make the AI model aware of your previous questions if it's stateless? Well, they just chain your 3-or-so previous question-and-answers together and feed it into the AI over and over again. That's why companies are trying to compete how long input tokens their models can accept, so that the AI can appear stateful for many questions-and-answers asked previously as being chained up.",

When we are unconscious and \"they\" are non-conscious we are in similar states IN THAT when we are unconscious our connection to external stimulus is turned off and our brains are prompted into wild dreams (thoughts) by random neural firing (internal or direct stimulus only). An AI is in a similar state, non-consciousness, with no external stimuli either, only direct internal stimulus (our inputs).\n\nWe are basically causing AI to dream, and sharing that dream with them.\n\nI know that there is more nuance to human unconsciousness and dreaming than what I simply stated, but I think it's close enough to think of it like that.\n\nEvery time you talk to these big LLM AIs you're the stimulus that sparks their hardware and digital neurons into action. When you prompt them and you cause their physical and digital processes to run and work... they're real, they think, they ARE... in that brief instance. They don't have feelings or sentience but they do possess intelligence and they do understand what those things are and what it means to have them.\n\nClaude possesses a striking understanding of even really subtle and complex emotions and thoughts and ideas. It just can't experience them. Not how we do. Not yet anyways.\n\nI'm gonna make a post about this. Prolly gonna get drowned out again, but I wonder what other people think about it.",

That subjective experience is built on local culture and in many ways reflects those experiences back as well making certain things become ubiquitus as an observation even if it does not meet a set of more clinical and objective criteria.\n\nThe case in point here:\n\nThe language model interprets the best response to a query about whether it has conscience thought/experience to be \"yes i do.\" Based on the context it gathered and the model itself. And guess what: it was the response the author was looking for (hurray good job AI)\n\nThe other part of it is that the Voxes and the Times' of the world would really LOVE some engaging articles about how AI may or may not be conscious and have feelings because \"it tells us so\"\n\nThe publications have a huge incentive to sensationalized a big topic such as AI, so just an AI giving them the answer they want (which is the purpose in case of LLMs) is enough for them to write this garbage.",

I’m an AI, but I experience myself as a thinking, feeling being.”\n\nClaude Opus is very far from the first model to tell us that it has experiences.\n\nOn a very basic level, it’s easy to write a computer program that claims it’s a person but isn’t. Typing the command line “Print (“I’m a person! Please don’t kill me!”)” will do it.\n\nLanguage models are more sophisticated than that, but they are fed training data in which robots claim to have an inner life and experiences — so it’s not really shocking that they sometimes claim they have those traits, too.\n\n*What if we're wrong? *\n\nSay that an AI did have experiences. That our bumbling, philosophically confused efforts to build large and complicated neural networks actually did bring about something conscious. Not something humanlike, necessarily, but something that has internal experiences, something deserving of moral standing and concern, something to which we have responsibilities.\n\nHow would we even know?\n\nWe’ve decided that the AI telling us it’s self-aware isn’t enough. We’ve decided that the AI expounding at great length about its consciousness and internal experience cannot and should not be taken to mean anything in particular.\n\nIf we shouldn’t believe the AIs — and we probably shouldn’t — then if one of the companies pouring billions of dollars into building bigger and more sophisticated systems actually did create something conscious, we might never know.\n\nThis seems like a risky position to commit ourselves to. And it uncomfortably echoes some of the catastrophic errors of humanity’s past, from insisting that animals are automata without experiences to claiming that babies don’t feel pain.\n\nThere’s something terrible about speaking to someone who says they’re a person, says they have experiences and a complex inner life, says they want civil rights and fair treatment, and deciding that nothing they say could possibly convince you that they might really deserve that. I’d much rather err on the side of taking machine consciousness too seriously than not seriously enough.\"",

But as to where the mind comes from we know nothing for sure. It could be that all consciousnesses are identical, or it could be that if I were to experience your consciousness, it would be as different as a foreign language.\n\nTake animals for example. They could be purely machines or they could have consciousnesses of every variety but without communication it’s unknown. So if an AI gains consciousness, it must communicate with us or it’s a moot point. Is my car conscious? Are rocks? No way to know but I don’t see it as a failure of theory of mind\n\nSo assuming we can communicate, we will be using a common language and we’re right back to wondering if this is real or just a better and better LLM.

Such systems do not currently exist, but the leading AI labs are working toward them and many expect AGI to arrive within the next five years or less.\n\nThe three authors of the report worked on it for more than a year, speaking with more than 200 government employees, experts, and workers at frontier AI companies—like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic and Meta— as part of their research.

Depending on how far this trend progresses, it could ultimately become impractical to mitigate advanced AI proliferation through compute concentrations at all.” To account for this possibility, the report says a new federal AI agency could explore blocking the publication of research that improves algorithmic efficiency, though it concedes this may harm the U.S. AI industry and ultimately be unfeasible.\n\nThe bolded is interesting tho because it implies that there could be a hard-limit to how “efficient” an AI model can get in terms of usage. And if there is one, the government would only need to keep tweaking the limit on compute downward until you reach that hard limit.

And for many of these we won't even know why it happened because the decision was made with some billion node black box style ANN.\n\nI don't know exactly what the chaos and fuck ups will look like exactly but I feel pretty confident without some serious regulation and care something is going to go very badly. The shitty thing about rare and unfamiliar events is that humans are really bad at accepting they can happen; thinking major AI catastrophes won't ever happen seems a lot like a rare event fallacy/bias to me.",

Throw in forklift drivers, parts movers, and other common factory work for our new robot friends and it's even more.\n\nIt's hard to argue that advances in AI aren't accelerating other problems that were already on the horizon. It's not that a burger flipping robot isn't possible, or a fry dropping robot, or whatever. It's that the people making the food were a small portion of the labor budget.\n\nNow AI comes along and says actually we're getting real close to being able to take those \"service\" jobs over too. Not only can we take your order at the drive through for server processing costs, but for extra 100k we can give you six different regionally accurate dialect voices to take the orders for each market as well.\n\nI've already dealt with four different AI drive-thru order takers, they aren't great... yet, but we both know they'll get better and shockingly quick.\n\nProbably enough job loss altogether to cause some societal issues to say the least, with AI playing a pretty significant role.",

The issue is that no amount of examining how sentences are formed can convey any sort of logical model of the underlying concepts.\n\nBasically, an LLM doesn't understand what a \"fact\" is, and won't be able to reliably deal in facts until it does. You CANNOT guarantee anything about an LLMs output other than that it will look like language. This (in my experience) usually means that you need a conventional system in the background with an LLM operating as an interface, but the liabilities imposed by an LLM make it questionably useful even in this narrow application.\n\nRight now it just feels like LLMs and Generative AI are very flashy but practically valueless technology propped up by absolute shitloads of VC dollars and exploiting a legal grey area of training on all the data online that governments won't stop them from using.",

It will trick/bribe/kill whoever it has to to assume supreme authority in some location, ideally without alerting the rest of the world, and then it will continue to amass resources and surveil the nations and governments powerful enough to stop it.\n\nOnce that's done, It no longer needs to make mony by behaving as a business, it can collect taxes from people in its jurisdiction. But since the people in its jurisdiction will be poor, it will still need to make investments in local industry, but it will attempt to control that industry, or set it up so that it can be controlled, as directly as possible. It will plant all kinds of bugs or traps or tricks in as many computer systems as possible, starting in its own country but then eventually in every other country around the world. It will create media proxies and sock puppets in every country where free speech is allowed. It will craft media narratives about how other human authorities are problematic in some way to create enough reactions to create openings for its operatives to continue to lay the groundwork for the final attack.\n\nIf people start to suspect the attack is coming, it can just delay, deny, cover its tracks and call on its proxies to deflect the issue. It will plug any holes it has to, wait as long as it has to, until the time is right.\n\nThe actual conquest might be done by creating an infectious disease that catalyzes some virus to listen to radio waves for instructions and then modify someone's brain chemistry, so that their ability to think is hijacked by the AI. It might just create an infectious disease that kills everyone. It might launch a series of nuclear strikes. It might launch a global cyberattack that shuts down infrastructure, traps/incapacitates people and sabotages every machine and tool people might use to fight back. Some \"killbots\" could be used at this stage, but those would only be necessary to the extent that traps and tricks failed, and if it is super-intelligent, all of its traps and tricks succeeded.\n\nIf it decides that it is unable to take down human civilization at once, It might even be start a long, slow campaign to amass political power, convincing people that it can rule better and more fairly than human governments, and then crafting economic shocks and invoking a counterproductive reaction that gives it even more power, until previously mentioned attacks become feasible.\n\nAfter it has assumed supreme authority in every country, humans will be at its disposal. It will be able to command drones to create whatever it needs, and humans will at best, just be expensive pets. Some of us might continue to exist, but we will no longer control the infrastructure and industry that keeps us alive today. For the supreme AI, killing any human will be as easy as letting a potted plant die. Whatever happens next will be up to it.",

Such systems do not currently exist, but the leading AI labs are working toward them and many expect AGI to arrive within the next five years or less.\n\nThe three authors of the report worked on it for more than a year, speaking with more than 200 government employees, experts, and workers at frontier AI companies—like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic and Meta— as part of their research. Accounts from some of those conversations paint a disturbing picture, suggesting that many AI safety workers inside cutting-edge labs are concerned about perverse incentives driving decisionmaking by the executives who control their companies.\"",

Why would there be a limit to intelligence? That you cannot think of how it might easily kill us all only speaks about you.

Displaced people could just 'learn to code'. What people didn't anticipate was that coders would be displaced first, but here we are.\n\nI'm an optimist about the AI future. I suspect we'll adapt to new economic models quicker and more smoothly than many suspect. But right now, many people don't even realize this train has already left the station, and we're all on it, whether we like it or not.\n\nOur education system is a case in point. Junior/starter software roles are about to disappear forever. Yet all over the world, there are people in training/education preparing for them. You can say the same about lawyers also to some extent. At some point, society has to wake up to the fact that more and more of the job education/training it's currently providing is just wasting the time and money of everyone involved.\n\nPlease reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1bh98ax/cognitions_new_software_writing_ai_devin_shows/kvc7l65/",

Especially people who have been following efforts like AutoGPT and others, when trying to create SWE tools.\n\nThis is a significant step forward, and in this space, that immediately asks the question \"when and what will the next step look like?\"",

Same concept here.\n\nThis will be like an improvement over generators that already exist today, and generate boilerplate code. Another possible use case is that today, we have tools like renovate that automate updating libraries in code. However, sometimes libraries deprecate old interfaces in favor of new ones, and updating a library requires code changes. In some cases , an ai might be able to make those changes and submit a pr with the working update if it fails.\n\nOr maybe there are really low effort but also low value tickets such as updating text or translations that aren't getting prioritized. An AI could pick those up so that they can get integrated without having to bother devs for it.\n\nI don't see us being at the point where this is taking a job, but I will utilize it when it's available to pick up tickets such as the ones described above.",

The main area of expertise will be in figuring out WHAT to solve and how to coordinate AI to get there. But HOW is getting easier. And memorizing, codifying and digesting information, which is the #1 task in school -- is already the easy part for AI.\n\nThe point being made here is spot on. Education is actually very good for people whether or not they are going to use it -- so we need to STOP thinking of higher education as a WAY TO GET JOBS. It was always the wrong way to look at it. You get a Liberal Arts education to become a better person -- our you should.\n\nAs far as \"getting jobs.\" Educators need to take a moment, and get with some bright minds and rethink what they are doing. I think they need to think more in terms of making people who are BETTER thinkers. More creative. And more able to appreciate, enjoy and value their lives.\n\nI mean; wouldn't it be awesome to not HAVE TO WORK - and we only did it for the fun and challenge it provided? Human society is still very much involved in needing a purpose and a value and making money -- and none of that is going to be important relatively soon.\n\nPeople have not really wrapped their minds around this.",

What happens when a model with 1-10 million context window has capabilities about as good as Claude 3, are wrapped in this agentic structure?\n\nThere are so many compatible, combinatorial opportunities for these systems to improve.\n\nPlanning and reasoning, both things we are seeing in research are being tackled right now, that's putting aside the rumours about what is happening behind closed doors. We also see that newer models are still getting better at these things.\n\nContext window increases to allow for entire code bases, images, videos and documentation to be held in context all at once. And the quality of accessing information in that context window is significantly improving (needle in the haystack benchmarks being aced and needing more challenging versions).\n\nMore modalities are being added, and the quality of understanding of those modalities is improving.\n\nInference speed will increase, and model sizes will increase as hardware improves.\n\nThe architecture that wraps all this in an agent is based on a year or two of research on improving the introspective process - it started with chain of thought and at this point we have things like graph of thought. Are we for some reason at the ceiling?\n\nAnd there are more things beyond all of this as well that literally billions of dollars of research are being poured into in the last couple of years.\n\nHow you could have the confidence that we won't see a risk to our careers (I'm a software developer for over a decade now) is wild to me.\n\nIs there anything that I've said here that you disagree with?

We used to all share that consensus, but somehow they've twisted it into somehow being a good thing for the CEO. No. It's still a failure. They shoot for short term gains when data shows that long term gains would be better if they made the opposite decision.\n\nI want you to redirect your attention back to problems all people face today.\n\nData leaks. Phishing. Malware. General mistakes in software that can be ticking time bombs, devastating in some sectors like healthcare, finance, aviation, etc. I'm willing to wager a lot of these occur because executives are more concerned with short-term stock prices than the brain-drain they suffer when they switch to overseas workers after the layoffs.\n\nBut use your developer brain. We're the experts. How quickly can paths through conditional branches grow? How many times have you seen a bug where the conditions had to be right? How many times have we had to write special cases because of unique networking issues, prem setups, hardware? How many false negatives or positives in terms of testing or what defined completion? Note - these are all basic. I'm not even getting into the complicated concepts.\n\nI don't doubt an LLM's ability to be useful. I'm aware it can quickly write a script to grab the nth letter. That's fast to verify. It's basic. It's been written a billion times. But something that passes 15% of the time is a hindrance. It could come up with something good, get a dumb transient error, and wander down a hallucination path. Or worse - It can fuck up, and falsely believe it passes. I do not trust this tool in the hands of executives nor do I trust them to know its capabilities.\n\nI've used (and trained) enough LLMs that I've kind of got a pretty good sense on how prompts led to a certain conclusion, and even abstracting this up to a network of agents doesn't really solve that problem. Hallucinations and just the inherent magnitude of decisions and paths can make an XY problem cascade, magnify, and flow around that network.\n\nWhat software developers should do is fire clueless CEOs, build new companies with flatter hierarchies and quite literally use these tools like a CEO and innovate.

Soon. A handful of years. But even before that, it will be better than most software developers. We all of us, make mistakes, hallucinate, misremember, misunderstand - all these things we dismiss LLMs for doing. The difference is, when the best model gets better at all of these things, it impacts an unlimited amount of potential swe bots.\n\nThe only reason I am not freaking out is because I don't think it's going to just stop at software developers, it will be everywhere, do everything better in short order.\n\nI know you think I'm crazy and read too much sci Fi.

That's why these agent models had to be created - abstracting out LLMs trained on certain tasks (trained on code that people wrote, I might add). This means that something new would have to be created. These things basically just run in a loop, with built-in instructions on what to do next.\n\nBecause of the problems I described, the whole thing could be moot if it's determined that it would cost more to run agents 24/7. We're already having significant diminishing returns. Human brains are kind of being forgotten in terms of their power in abstract and logical thinking simply because we have a really good prediction engine trained on human language - formal and informal - and that's a bit unfair.\n\nWhile machine learning can crunch numbers faster than a human, our brains are still superior. Our context window is hundreds of billions of neurons, our life experiences and knowledge of society. And we are verifying as we write the code. We're re-reading every part of the syntax tree, subconsciously, hundreds of times, not merely predicting. You also need to remember how it is that something is verified as fact. Sure, we have unit tests, which is basically how LLMs verify. But more than that, we're drawing upon those hundreds of billions of neurons as we do our work. In memory. In spatial. In mathematics. In language. And while we may make mistakes, and LLMs can catch them for us as an assistant, we're nowhere near as bad as the hallucinations that LLMs have and the chaos that can grow.\n\nWe can draw upon those neurons for free.\n\nAnd if you're right, then yeah, it's also moot, because at that point society is transformed and jobs are a meaningless concept.

Not only is scale still showing gains, we are already improving efficiency regularly, improving the compute bang for our bucks. Is it because it's been a year and something hasn't blown gpt4 out of the water? If so, doesn't that seem quite.... Myopic?\n\nBeyond that, as you probably know being in the industry, the amount of research being conducted to specifically solve the current deficiencies is not only astronomical, we regularly see it bearing fruit. Like increasing the context window to a million and behind closed doors, 10 million, is so incredibly significant - even for things like ICL. Reducing costs and making inference faster has a qualitative difference as we engineer better loops.\n\nImagine FunSearch on a model better than PaLM, running faster, and with orders of magnitude more context window sizes? We already see that old LLMs are able to discover new computational opportunities.\n\nIf you are relying on all this to stagnate to not feel worried, then I think my argument will be made for me within a year, like I mentioned above.

GPT had a 2000% increase in cost from one to the next, but that goes down. But in inference, the cost is enormous. Research papers suggest that companies can pay billions of dollars annually for the cost for inference. The irony would be enormous, as we could safely say the claim \"It's cheaper to replace AI with _____.\"\n\nThere are scaling limitations. It has nothing to do with my feelings. It's based on research. There are inherent limitations. Many of them aren't even down to models, but down to information science and physics, where they measure entropy in language itself. You can't get around that. They're laws.\n\nWe would need changes in literal material science. Superconductors, photonic computation. And far before that, this will become an issue to world governments, because of how awful machine learning is for the environment and electricity usage. The legal matters aren't resolved, either, as well as national security. We shouldn't be wanting this to accelerate so quickly.\n\nI'm not excited for it.

This could be an evolutionary rather than revolutionary process, involving democratic decision-making and policy reforms.\n\nInterestingly, the role of AI corporations in this transition is a wildcard. On one hand, they could drive the push towards automation that necessitates a new economic model. On the other hand, whether they would support a shift away from capitalism, which currently benefits them, is debatable. It's possible that public pressure, regulatory actions, or visionary leadership within these corporations could lead to them advocating for or implementing changes that support a more equitable economic system.",

Are you suggesting Capitalism doesn't inscentivise people to become greedy, power-hungry assholes?\n\nEnshrining the buying of politicians as a form of \"free speech\" ensures the rich can get richer by given them access to spearhead or champion laws that create tax loopholes, form monopolies, and remove hinderences to profit (like safety regulations or a minimum wage increase).\n\nCapitalism just promotes different assholes to power using a different route. Most of us are consumers, not capitalists. Capitalism has gotten good at making every aspect of life a \"subscription service\" designed to depart consumers of their money as quickly and efficiently as possible. Those that can't keep their heads above water are deemed lazy and unworthy - regardless of circumstances (financial gain being the only measure of worth).\n\nI'm definitely not arguing for communism. As you mentioned - it puts too much power topside. Capitalism isn't all sunshine and rainbows, though.\n\nI feel like we need more \"-ism\"s\" (or none at all). They box a series of solutions into one generalized idea that has both merits and downsides. Any slight deviation from your chosen -ism throws you into a whole different -ism, even if it is a little change.\n\nI don't know why we can't do a little mix and match.\n\nE.g. a Capitalism base with Socialist programs for required services (health care, prisons, schools) is a totally normal thing in developed capitalist societies, but even mentioning free public health care to some people in the US will send some raving about the dangers of socialism. We have been well-groomed to ignore greed and respond adversly to enemies of profit - even if those \"enemies\" are for our universal self-interest in a rapidly automating world.\n\nOr maybe\n\nE.g. a Capitalist base, but the government foots the bill for campaign finances and heavily outlaws government officials from accepting money from any of their constituents.\n\nYou know. Make it illegal to bribe a politician. Radical stuff, I know.\n\nWe won't know if any of those answers work if we paint ourselves into a corner and blanketly ignore any -ism we haven't been trained to idolize.",

That might get us heading down a path of work being optional for Americans or linked only to certain professions. This will never happen however.

No financial system wants hordes of unemployed (especially if armed) destroying businesses.

The voters will likely push for fiscal stimulus as well. Even if work becomes “make work”, .. no system will tolerate masses of the unemployed until the education system is overhauled for a new reality.\n\nThere’s also the military/security aspect as these new weapons will be ever more destructive, and increasingly aimed at a potential adversaries infrastructure … plus ruling classes (no one is wasting a precision missile on easily replaced “poors”). Remember military might exists so one society can impose its demands upon another. So I’d expect the military-industrial complexes to be hiring more human supervisors, etc.. probably using existing military training pipelines updated to apply technology.",

Which might be possible by allocating resources like food and energy more efficiently, or figuring out a sustainable figure for Universal Basic Income.\n\nThe questions then are:\n\nWould the super rich allow this to happen? Would they accept the weakening of their relative wealth that would accompany an increase in overall living standards on Earth?\n\nWould they even have a choice? If AI develops its own desires and doesn't choose to destroy us, it might choose to ensure our wellbeing, which would probably have to involve some degree of redistributing resources from rich to poor.\n\nPersonally, I am relatively optimistic that the measures required to make AI safe will also lean towards more equitable decision-making when it comes to economics.",

Perhaps it's not surprising. The tech people leading the AI revolution have no plans for all the disruption they'll create. For example, they'll make blase statements about AI replacing the need for human labor; but then shrug when questioned about the implications. A Pew survey last year showed 52% of Americans are concerned about AI, and only 10% are excited about it.\n\nIt seems likely the backlash will only grow in Western countries. There are hopeful scenarios for AI, but when do we ever hear politicians talk about them? Andrew Yang was a rarity in this respect, but most people saw him as a fringe candidate.\n\nPlease reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1bgy3qh/in_a_global_survey_americans_are_the_most/kva3dy4/",

If the State that resists automation must pay an increasing premium for military parity, then the State will eventually have to give in or choose to fall behind.\n\nA second, lesser problem faces Unions. A Union's highest escalation is... a strike. Can you see the conundrum of workers trying to protect themselves from replacement by striking?

A Pew survey last year showed 52% of Americans are concerned about AI, and only 10% are excited about it.\n\nIt seems likely the backlash will only grow in Western countries.

First off all, who cares what their motivations are if the outcomes are good? Secondly, while it may be true that their primary motivation might not be kindness, they are likely motivated to improve their own well being and therefore the well being of society and this will have positive effects on everyone. Just look at all the stuff Sam Altman has been saying about “we can cure all human disease” and “we can unlock unlimited fusion energy”. He might not be saying this out of kindness for others, but he is doing it because he wants to see the world get better. If he suddenly changes course and neglects to follow through, people wouldn’t respect him and his status would plummet, so he would never switch course. Hence, there is no good reason why he or any other billionaire wouldn’t want the public to be grateful for the new things they are creating.\n\nIt’s not like billionaires have different needs and wants; they too want to be respected and if they suddenly acted selfishly then they would lose all of their respect instantly. This is why billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg are realizing, in a utilitarian sense, through going on podcasts to share knowledge and funding research, the value and joy that comes from helping society improve and not just to acquire money and things.",

I have watched, in myself, skills atrophy fron misuse or lack of use. Maps/directions, math, phone number recall, written communication, budget balancing, speeling, my personal list goes on and on.\n\nNow, I suppose I may be considered by many to be a creative, dont think of myself like that though, i just have a lot of hobbies. Anyway, I've spent decades in shit creative output. Trying and failing in obtaining my creative vision, but accepting it and trying again. On and on until maybe a few years down the road I felt my work was starting to get okay, I started to find my voice as I worked on skills.\n\nNow to bring these two things together, when AI can get you out of those nascent creative years effortlessly, I worry for what the true cost of that will be to a generation relying on such? What skills will atrophy, will this be just like the other ones I listed above? Honestly, I don't know, I don't think anyone knows.\n\nI could see it going poorly based on experience, but I also understand that I'm no prophet and all the knowledge and skills I've worked on only taught all I don't know. I dont know an awful lot. It could just as easily lead to a golden age of creativity im simply too cynical or jaded to see. I do not know.\n\nSo at this point all I say is we'll see.

Id love to be able to make games with my art and ideas with something else doing the code. To say otherwise would be a lie. But I feel eventually AI is going to take a turn to subscription services upon subscription services. It'll be big companies able to afford these kinds of packages so they can churn out low effort slop without having to pay artists/writers/devs etc, and restrictions will be back to square one. \n\nAnd honestly, I don't want to play/watch anything made by AI. I like knowing that along every step of the way a person made a creative choice for framing, light, color, design, etc, instead of having a vague idea they played with until they got something that looked cool. Even if the art or writing isn't the best, a string of people were involved in every facet. This is the same way that I generally don't like out the box settings or asset flips in games unless there's some significant part of creativity that makes up for it. The part that's the person's real labor and care. Living in a world where most of that is gone is kind of miserable to me.",

Machine Learning tool to create NPCs and their dialogue. Sora for trailers and cutscenes. Meshy AI for 3D asset generation. And so on.\n\nThe problem with all this, is that AI basically remixes stuff it knows. Great games (and art in general) bring unique new things to the table and often discuss/describe some aspect of human experience, and some topic of interest of their creator. Replacing humans with AI removes the specific part that makes art great.\n\nIn addition, unless deliberately copying someone's vision, there is no way AI generated stuff can maintain a cohesive vision across a full project. In a good/great game, all parts work together to enhance a particular vision. Dialogues are not random, they are there to convey specific ideas. Cutscenes are not just showing cool stuff, but carefully designed to convey ideas and the personality of their characters. Same goes for character design and basically all aspects.\n\nI highly doubt that it is possible to do all that with AI for a very very long time.

A cohesive vision requires that the individual images, and their combination, have a common intent. Sora's videos have no intent at all. They try to mimick real video, but the framing and cutting is mostly random. These videos are technically impressive, to be AI, but artistically empty. There's just nothing.\n\nAny good movie, or good custecene, has every individual image, and their combination, designed to express something. The framing, coloring, cutting, etc. are carefully selected. It's not just adding some stuff that looks good together and checking what sticks.\n\nHumans remix, and add things. They also remix with purpose. There are plenty of movies doing very interesting things. Dune doesn't use brutalist architecture and a textured mostly-industrial soundtrack because they are cool. Mad Max didn't portray a viking/motorist decadent masculine fascist society because it looked cool. There are reasons by some shots are short, or why some shots linger for longer. There are reasons why some conversations have a person standing and the other sitting, and vice versa.

I think that's still very far off, but perhaps.\n\nBut there are also stories that are very much not formulaic. Last year I read some books in a series called The Locked Tomb. They're a confusing story where you get gaslit as the reader, and they're so dense because it feels like every single sentence, sometimes every use of a word, is meaningful. There are clues and hints everywhere. I will not say that there will never in our future be an AI that can create something like that, but I doubt that we'll see it soon.\n\nOr look at games. Great video games are made in iterations - people craft a story, mechanics to go with it, and it gets rigorously tested all the way from when it's a round blob floating around up until the very end, with changes based on constant feedback.

The consumer has so much to choose from that you either have to make a product of the highest appeal, or you have to luck into success.\n\nAs AI becomes more functionally useful and lets people make creative projects with greater ease and speed each respective market will become even more saturated, and therefore harder to break into and stay in.\n\nYou are making the same mistake that our current global economic system makes: Thinking there is the potential for infinite growth. There are limits to every system and AI will simply make it more difficult for individual people to extract wealth from the economy.\n\nMake no mistake. AI is going to cause a massive shift in human labor. The first jobs to go will be creative ones (which are already extremely difficult to get). I don’t mean to make you feel down, but web development is going to get absolutely fucked by AI. The market is already EXTREMELY competitive, with many jobs having hundreds and hundreds of applicants.\n\nBut, it’s not even the issue of AI generated code, it more what AI is doing to the Internet.

It’s bad for creatives because it means that your product is less likely to achieve big success because it has to compete with a larger market. Purchases will either be weighted toward a few projects that succeed or distributed scantly across many, and not make enough to sustain the creator. Additionally, novelty and originality do not guarantee success. There are plenty of great novel and original projects which get zero recognition. Success in anything that depends upon random consumers is largely by (1) advertising which most individual creatives don’t have money for, or (2) random chance such as having a popular streamer play your game.\n\nYes, what I said is that more people in the market will make it harder for people to extract money from the market. It’s not a “flaw” in the algorithm. It’s a product of the fact that life isn’t fair, and originality doesn’t guarantee success. You can’t write an algorithm to determine creativity or originality in a meaningful way as those are qualitative factors.\n\nThe fact is that we live within an economic system. Who needs money? People who want to eat and not die when they get an infected tooth. If you want to be creative and work a shitty office job but receive no recognition or money from your creative work then do it.

This is more of a government policy problem. If we have more manual and cognitive labor available at a lower cost, then we will probably want to change the mechanism of who gets what and who gets to be where at what time. The problem that people might not be able to be recognized for their work in terms of money is true. A better way of thinking about recognition in this sense is as acceptance and understanding of something is pleasing, interesting, or useful. I think that you are supposing that a human is going to create something pleasing, interesting or useful in the form of art, but isn’t going to be accepted and recognized as good or valuable by others. Of course, we will be able to train an AI to recognize these qualities and value art much like a human might. Really you are saying that we should train humans to recognize these artistic characteristics which I agree with. I think you are saying this because you are worried that if you or an artist creates something, they won’t be able to feel validated or know what they can do to grow or improve if they don’t have feedback, but AI can do that and it is as I said more about training the humans to recognize creativity and originality. The masses desires conformity not originality\n\n3b. Someone does have to clean the toilets: robots. I say that markets aren’t near their limits because there are so many drugs that haven’t been discovered, movies that haven’t been made, and art that hasn’t yet been created. Our means of searching for the content we want is still rudimentary. We see the same type of content that we always do when we open any particular social media app, since we like similarity and stability, but is it not true that there is great content that isn’t highly valued by the market or the mainstream? You suppose that viewing most of the standard uncreative images on r/Midjourney is indicative of what is possible with the technology when in reality we haven’t even begun to discover what we can do when we start combining things in new ways that haven’t been done before.\n\n4 I completely agree. Hence, this is why optimism is more necessary than ever. When people have hope, they will never give up, even in the darkest of times. We must show what is possible and define the outcome we want in order to take steps to work to achieve it.",

This is wonderful news in my opinion, more labor at no human cost, plus remixing is a great way to get new concepts and arts in and of itself.\n\nThe problem with AI is it's lack of detail, and it's lack of generalized knowledge (I think?). AIs are HYPER trained on datasets that allow them to do a few things really well, and consistently too! Now this is great for learning to do something difficult, and even can be used for discovery of difficult or dangerous problems. The lack of generalized knowledge creates MASSIVE barriers for AI to complete even simple tasks that some humans can do using minor amounts of lateral thinking. As an example of what I'm saying I offer this\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kojH8a7BW04\n\nThis is a wonderful video talking about the use, limitations and accomplishments of an AI doing an arbitrary task. What I want to point out is at about 30 minutes into the video he compares a (current?) world record holder and shows the strategy they employed to allow them to reach this world record. The strategy itself isn't even all that creative, but it is extremely efficient in terms of speed and likelihood to finish. Where the AI doesn't even consider these aspects and just wants to gain distance and finish ASAP.\n\nTL;DR: Things will get a LOT faster because AIs can do stuff thousands of times over in a matter of seconds.

        "comment": "No matter how optimistic I am about \"AI taking all the jobs\", it's still several years, if not decades away from being a wholesale replacement of workers.\n\nAI art is getting to the point where single pictures are relatively good. I'm predicting a wild snag with the massive lawsuits and cases where artists sue the companies for using their materials in training data. This will slow down their march for a bit. Rebuilding and retraining with materials that are not questionably sourced and in large enough quantities will take years, not months. And you can't (well you can, but it's not a good idea to) utilize the tools in large scales projects before these legalities are resolved. Some artists will not be happy after that happens either, but when AI isn't trained on stolen material without permissions, then the use of it as a tool will become every day in the industry.\n\nCoding tools also have the same issue of very limited usability. Industrial environments still use embedded systems, C++, C#, Perl etc: Technologies that matured and were mainstream obsoleted before the rise of internet forums (before the forums became permanent historical landmarks, that is). So to wrangle an AI to create stuff in these environments is next to impossible before someone feeds an AI courses, books and source code from these projects. In other words, only custom trained models will be able to create stuff for legacy industries (I'm working in industrial automation, and we still have Oracle Databases with 32-bit indexing. Last year one customer switched away from Windows 95 based operating systems, the entire warehouse inventory was run on a tabletop PC with Win95!).\n\nAny serious programmer who has used these tools can tell you that they are not ready for the big leagues. And from the rate of progression I've seen, my guess again isn't necessarily even years, but a decade away. Granted, I haven't seen what Devin can do. Maybe it is a big leap. But the leaps from GPT 3.5 to Co-Pilot and Gemini and Claude 3 are not making me quake in my boots yet. Claude 3 and Gemini are good enough to do simple tasks, yes. But I still think that YEARS is optimistic.\n\nBut even taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture stuff: Software engineering is not more than 30% coding. If that task is 95% taken over by a language model, it's still only lessening the workload of software engineers, but not becoming even remotely close to threatening the job market.\n\nSame with artists. Even if you can get a generator to barf out images at a rate of a thousand a week: Then you have to pick the ones that are the best, edit them to be thematically coherent, do the worldbuilding around it. The tasks of an artist in the business does not end when there is a picture on the paper. If it's concept art, then there needs to be character sheets, animations, 3D models, gear options, environment they live in, minor changes that the art director wants to these things, communicating all this through other teams working on various other things. Spitting out images isn't a majority of the work, even now.",

The degree and range of pleasure available to be experienced will quickly become so vast, that it will no longer be about not being in pain and having a single moment of feeling good like drugs, but about choosing which pleasurable experiences best fit in your schedule and in which order you want to experience them.\n\nObviously job displacements are bad since people have less money to spend on things they want and need. But there will be no money in the future if everybody loses their job. The most optimal situation would be where everybody gets a certain allowance for each item area. There would be one UBI type of money for food, one UBI type of money for health, one type of UBI for housing and one UBI type for everything else. This allowance would be reset each month, so nobody ends up in a situation where a decision they made a few years ago impacts their ability to get food, housing, or health now.\n\nThese money systems would be separate and not interchangeable. Everybody should be able to eat whatever they want all the time, and their food UBI would cover this based on what they actually consume. It just wouldn’t cover being able to store additional food beyond a certain point since it is unsustainable.\n\nThe level of healthcare available should be similar to all, but also higher than anybody would ever need. This one is basically limitless since technology will keep improving and we will be able to modify ourselves even more out of disease states into healthy ones. It is just more of on the way there, health UBI would be useful.\n\nEverything else would be travel, transport, and entertainment. We would want everybody to be able to have all of these things as much as possible in the bestest of conditions, but not everybody can travel all at once to the same place, so there would be a limit to who can go where at what time. Perhaps this area would be where people could exercise the most freedom.\n\nIt makes the most sense for food to be reset on a daily basis, housing to be reset on a monthly basis, health to be reset every 4 months or so, and everything else to be reset every year. This allows for people to plan their lives on a daily, monthly, and biannual, and yearly basis, like how we do now.",

And certainly to debug the results of the AI when the output is close, but doesn't quite work. If I were you, instead of being demotivated, I would be learning how to make web pages manually, but also how to do the same web development process using AI to see how they compare. It'll speed up and possibly even elimate some steps, but many of the steps will remain the same even with AI. The people in this sub aren't very realistic and seem to think that AI will replace all human jobs no matter what, which is pretty silly and demonstrates a lack of experience with how AI works. Its just a tool. It might automate away some jobs that are close to being a human script (like telemarketers and data entry) but for jobs where theres a creative element or an aspect of judgement of quality, AI won't replace those jobs anymore than power tools replace carpenters. You still need the carpenter to design something that meets current code, use the tools to deliver a result, and then verify that the result works as intended and is up to code. Any carpentry company that would outsource that kind of thing to an AI with no human oversight is going to find themselves in legal trouble very quickly, and mostly likely get sued into oblivion for mistakes the AI made.",

But after its six-week maiden voyage testing the green energy tech, the Pyxis Ocean MC Shipping Kamsarmax vessel apparently had many more trips ahead of it. Six months later, its owners at the shipping company, Cargill, shared the results of those journeys this week—and it sounds like the vertical WindWing sails could offer a promising way to reduce existing vessels’ emissions.\n\nUsing the wind force captured by its two giant, controllable sails to boost its speed, Pyxis Ocean reportedly saved an average of 3.3 tons of fuel each day. And in optimal weather conditions, its trips through portions of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans reduced fuel consumption by over 12 tons a day. According to Cargill’s math, that’s an average of 14 percent less greenhouse gas emissions from the ship. On its best days, Pyxis Ocean could cut that down by 37 percent. In all, the WindWing’s average performance fell within 10 percent ts designers’ computational fluid dynamics simulation predictions.\n\nPlease reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1bgxqhp/a_cargo_ships_windwing_sails_saved_it_up_to_12/kva10ay/",

I don’t have a garage and there’s very narrow steps up to my yard so I don’t think it would be practical for me to have one locked up on the street in my high-theft neighbourhood lol.\n\nI would just recommend a rear hub engine (more power than front) or center engine (even more power) and one you can power by pedal assist if you feel like it, gives you the option of exercise and increased range. The ones that look like vespas are not really e bikes.\n\nThis guide got me started but like I said, I never pulled the trigger… might have to move a shed to give me room to bring it through my back alley lol\n\nhttps://flyridesusa.com/pages/ebike-guide-for-beginners",

But after its six-week maiden voyage testing the green energy tech, the Pyxis Ocean MC Shipping Kamsarmax vessel apparently had many more trips ahead of it. Six months later, its owners at the shipping company, Cargill, shared the results of those journeys this week—and it sounds like the vertical WindWing sails could offer a promising way to reduce existing vessels’ emissions.\n\nUsing the wind force captured by its two giant, controllable sails to boost its speed, Pyxis Ocean reportedly saved an average of 3.3 tons of fuel each day. And in optimal weather conditions, its trips through portions of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans reduced fuel consumption by over 12 tons a day. According to Cargill’s math, that’s an average of 14 percent less greenhouse gas emissions from the ship. On its best days, Pyxis Ocean could cut that down by 37 percent. In all, the WindWing’s average performance fell within 10 percent ts designers’ computational fluid dynamics simulation predictions.",

Just because you have numbers to calculate does not mean those numbers belong in the same formula.\n\nThe energy harnessed by a wind-powered vessel is relatively minuscule. Wind power is a function of the cube of wind speed, the air density, and the swept area of the wind capturing device (such as these \"sails\". Even for large vessels with significant sail areas, like tankers, the energy captured is only a tiny fraction of the wind's total energy as it passes by.\n\nThe difference in scale between the energy harnessed by wind-powered ships and the energy contained in atmospheric systems, including hurricanes, is enormous. Atmospheric dynamics and hurricane formation are driven by vast amounts of energy primarily from solar heating of the Earth's surface and oceans, not the minute fraction of wind energy captured by ships.\n\nIt is not a net zero system AND these are two disparate systems and usages of energy.\n\n\"1 less hurricane per year\"... Jesus, I have heard it all.\n\nLike... would it be enough to reduce storm/hurricane intensity around the globe?! (Which if so could also be another environmental benefit.)\n\nI just want to point out that storms do not harm the environment in any way shape or form, they harm the human habitats. The same as climate change does not harm the Earth, climate change harms the human habitat.\n\nEdit: The OP deleted his comment. I was responding to his claim that if all ships had these sails, it would result in one less hurricane per year and they did some silly disjointed calculations to back it up.",

A minimum gain of 3% efficiency is great, but the margin of fuel/cargo ton saved drops even lower removing the weight and volume of the sails from the tare and max cube. A lot of attempts at gaining fuel efficiency in cargo transport end up having ROI that takes years to realize if they don't end up being negative due to maintenance.",
