The injectors they use on ships are huge, and the burn time is so slow that the engine cannot turn more rapidly. recently, the great lakes banned using bunker fuel, and the stuff coming out of the stacks of the ships doesn't look like disgusting black tar anymore, and doesn't leave sticky bits all over them anymore. The local refinery now just burns their bunker fuel or ships it off to the coast for ocean going vessels.\n\nanother fun fact about bunker fuel, it comes in 3 varieties, A, B, and C. Most large ships have to preheat their fuel to 150C before they can even pump it, and then again have to preheat it to 350C before they can spray it out of the injector because otherwise it is too thick to move, pump, and won't even ignite or burn. The waste oil that doesn't get burned gets mixed in with their \"lube oil\" and has to be pumped out of the sump of the engine and stored until they reach port. That waste oil that is contaminated is then refined into more bunker fuel. These large ships also very often have very complex fuel systems that will do way more than just filter the stuff before it goes to the engine to burn.",

Or ideally if the engines have the ship up to speed it can maintain that speed by the sail matching the friction of the water. You don’t need all that much of a sail for that. When used together with the engines it will also result in less fuel usage.\n\nIt’s the same principle we use to sail around (small) satellites with light from the sun hitting a solar sail, friction is nearly non existent so the minuscule amount of energy from light is enough to make a difference.\n\nThe weight plays a role in the sense of how long it takes to get going or slow down, but not when maintaining speed iirc.",

Drag is proportional to surface area whereas tonnage is more related to volume. So when you increase tonnage moved from rail to ships, you're increasing surface area at a lower rate, decreasing the proportion of drag to tonnage, and decreasing energy losses. Ships also generally don't have to move up long grades, make large/fast turns, or stop for rail traffic, reducing frictional losses from brakes. Ships move slower meaning their losses to drag are also lower overall. Hydrodynamically, they are very optimized to move at their cruising speed. Larger powerplants also allow greater efficiency in energy production.",
