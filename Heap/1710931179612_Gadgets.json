They are all breast cancer.\n\nMaking the claim of \"x causes cancer\" without being even remotely specific in this kind of context is only borne from ignorance. By what mechanism does a cell phone cause cancer in the breast? Which part of phone technology? Is it the radio antenna? Is it the fast charging tech? Is it the contactless transmitter that enables you to touch to pay? Is it the electromagnetic field from the battery? Which mechanism?\n\nWhich part of the breast does it affect? The milk ducts themselves? The adjacent lymph nodes? The fat cells? The underlying muscle of the breast? The blood vessels? Which part specifically and by what technical aspect of a cell phone?\n\nThese claims are pure, unadulterated ignorance that could be dispelled with an actual 10 seconds of basic research. These claims are intentionally ambiguous and attractive to conspiracy theories because they are so ambiguous. They are ambiguous because specific claims can easily be factually dispelled, so the only way they can make a claim at all is if they don't understand the mechanisms involved and say something that takes way more time to factually dispel every conceivable aspect of what they claimed.\n\nThe most reasonable resolution to ambiguous claims is to wholesale dismiss them until the claimant is more specific, which they won't be because they don't even know what they are talking about. They don't even know the underlying mechanisms involved, but they weaponize their ignorance anyway because they think they havebeen awarded special knowledge.",

Ostensibly, it can detect variations caused by a mass as small as 2mm across, which is pretty cool if true. I didn't see anything about imaging, though.\n\nSpeaking specifically to the question about swelling, I'm guessing normal swelling from pregnancies or menstrual cycle wouldn't be detectable/reportable as the added mass wouldn't be the denser tissues associated with tumors. The red hats and theocrats will have to find some other way to Big Brother their way into women's bodily autonomy.",

That's normal. Disconcerting, but normal. You go to a doctor to get a look at it, she performs a mammogram to get a look at it, then takes a biopsy for analysis. It usually takes labs a while to come back with biopsy results, which then have to be interpreted by a pathologist and/or your GP. So in the mean time, you wait. While you're waiting, you have nothing but self-checks and maybe subsequent mammogram imaging to monitor potential progress.\n\nConsider alternative 1 - You're given the device to monitor your breast for changes while you await biopsy results. Now you have something which can tell you if the lump is growing or staying the same. If it's staying the same size (as determined by no change in conductivity), you at least have that going for you while waiting on results. If it's getting bigger, you have a problem and you really want to know about that as soon as possible.\n\nAlternative 2 - You get the device for yourself as a doctor-guided alternative to traditional mammograms. I have no first-hand knowledge of this, but every woman I know who's had one does not describe the experience as enjoyable. I'm pretty sure occasionally wearing an electric bra insert for the day would be preferable to \"putting your tits in a vice\" every two years. Plus, you'd have more frequent monitoring and don't have to wait for a lump to be big enough to be felt between mammograms. And you have collected data you can hand off to your GP.\n\nI would not want that question running through my head every day\n\nSee, again, I thought something similar about having a watch that could record information about my heart. At first, yeah, there was a bit of nervousness when I'd take an ECG reading (since you have to have a finger on one side of the watch and sit still while watching the readout record), but it didn't take long before it just became routine, like checking engine oil: you don't check it because you think something is wrong, you check it to verify things are still good.",

Is every woman expected to buy a boob scanner that hopefully works and use it regularly? Is that better than a visit to the doctor once a year? There's gonna be a lot of people that won't use it correctly, what do you do about that? Are you going to just trust that everything was done correctly? There's a reason why Doctors and techs perform this tests.",
