To us, it doesn't matter how we got to end result, what matters is that the artist is able to adequately express themselves. AI is a new avenue of expression. But you are absolutely welcome to dislike it the same way our parents hated on Rock N Roll, Rap and Electronic music lmao.\n\nEdit - And another question to help reframe this more: how great is the greatest painter if he has no creativity?

People are not being artistic by vaguely describing something and letting AI take care of all the details.\n\nIn fact, if one writes a really detailed prompt of the vision they have in their head (quite difficult to do), I doubt AI will do much differently than a vague prompt.\n\nPeople are really starting to be delusional...

        "comment": "I understand your perspective on this matter, especially in this era of AI art. The current generation of music AI models hasn't yet produced anything that resonates with me personally. However, I believe that as these models evolve and improve, everyone ‚Äî including you and me ‚Äî will eventually experience a moment of connection with a piece of music. It could be a moment when you can't resist dancing, feel chills, or even become emotional and tear up. This can happen in various contexts and circumstances, making it difficult to discern whether the music is AI-generated or not. And honestly, it doesn't matter. I think that moment will shift many people's perspectives once they experience it. I'd also argue that a significant part of our connection to music is not the intention of the artist who created it but how our brains have adapted to processing sound through lifelong exposure to music and associating certain sounds and songs with important memories. As someone who has been producing music for 8 years, I believe the experience of music is about listening to the piece, not so much the process behind its creation. That's how you determine if it sounds pleasant. Besides, if you find out a piece was AI-created after you've already enjoyed it, would you change your opinion? My point is: if you can't tell the difference, does it really matter? Most music consumption is now digital, and there's no way to tell if it's AI-generated if the quality matches that of human creation. Making the effort to manually check all of this seems excessive and unrealistic.",

People do that stuff without AI. In the end, AI just allows us to do \"human\" things, faster.\n\nI also find the obsession with \"AI stole from artists and kills human expression\" stuff to be its own cult. When you point out that Adobe made theirs with the art they own, that cult gets all fired up and waves it away as \"besides the point.\" Or if you point out most people stole images from Google Images every day already anyways for whatever they need, including artists who use them as reference images, that's also \"totally different because of scale and their use was ok.\"",
