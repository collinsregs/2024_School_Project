My take is the most important achievements of the 20th century were the limits of what we know: Planck is a real limit, Heisenberg shows real pairing limits, Gödel showed mathematical limitations for total proofs, and there may be another I’m not thinking off, but Chaos also shows limits of measurement vs initial states necessary to predict accuracy beyond modeling. Plus we now strongly surmise the universe lies on random microscopic events, lacking determinism.\n\nHence we might get a 10 day accuracy from 50% to say 70% from top down modeling but likely we will never achieve a 14 day 90% weather accuracy as it’s an exponential calculation based on immeasurably small measurements, and model-based forecasts from a non-static century of data showing changes in base conditions (temperature being key)\n\nNo expert, just lay book reader.",

Neither has been published because we are still working on the analysis 7 years later.\n\nIt takes a butt load of time to manually count and measure 2.85 million tree rings and then perform multi variable regression analysis, PCA, signals filtering (cause shit like fucking solar flares mess with the trees - fun fact), and so on.\n\nI have only ever deployed 1 reconstruction/projection equation - because the damn thing is over 1500 pages long on how to fully write it out.\n\nFor a better idea:\n\nHave >2.5 million lines of code going into predicting Lake Superior’s future water balance using only evaporation, and am nowhere near being done.\n\nThis is for only Lake Superior mind you.",

Valence electrons are “free electrons” that allow metals to conduct electric current. Free electrons move through metal like billiard balls, transferring energy as they knock into each other. Silver and copper are metals with single, free-moving valence electrons. The valance moves throughout the metal with little resistance, making these metals more conductive.\nSemi-conductor metals have multiple valence electrons, which reduces the repelling reaction. Think of the 8 ball: when it hits one ball, it knocks it farther than if it gently bumps into multiple balls. Semi-conductors, however, can become more effective electrical conductors when heated or combined with other elements. The resistance of semiconductors depends on the presence of impurities in the metal. In addition to impurities, other factors that can affect how a metal conducts electricity include frequency, electromagnetic fields and temperature.\nSilver has the highest conductivity of all metals, but it also has a hefty price tag and it can tarnish, rendering the surface less conductive. Gold is more corrosion-resistant.",

They are not more toxic than sodium chloride for the environment.\n\nMeanwhile, you make it sound like we pour boiling acid and toxic chemical waste on the road to keep it from freezing.\n\nIt's just Salt(s). The effect that makes it work called \"Freeze Point Depression,\" a so-called colligative property, that I had to study in Physcal Chemistry. Would it work with other substances? Sure, would they be comparable to either of the three chlorides both in price, availability, and (relative) non-toxicity? I doubt it. Does it suck for plant life near the road? Sure does, but so does the road itself, or do cars suddenly pump out pure oxygen (scratch that, that wouldn't be better), and tire wear or breake pad dust got completely eliminated? At least Salt is a non-artificial compound that species evolved to deal with and that can theoretically be reabsorbed into the earth's crust, unlike microplastics or forever-chemicals.",

No worries if it negatively affects others, tbh 😂\n\nI always think about Superman (Well, Christopher Reeves) when this comes up. For those unaware, he was an actor who played Superman way way back before MCU. He was larger than life- similar to how RDJ is Iron Man. Reeves was the OG to all of that. Reeves was thrown off of a horse and paralyzed at the peak of his career- a sad bit of irony for a man famous for playing Superman.\n\nAnyway- Reeves donated millions & millions of dollars to charities, single handedly funded & ultimately championing R&D of stem cell use (to be fair, a cause absolutely worthy of donation) which, at the time, was in it’s infancy.\n\nHis money did a lot of good, saved many lives, & furthered the study of biological sciences in a big way- I’m in no way denigrating his efforts… in his shoes I think most of if not all of us would do the same. It’s just a little funny to me, of course, he only did so after being paralyzed from the neck down himself lol. Prior to this incident he was in no way shape or form a prolific philanthropist by any stretch of the imagination 😏😂",

When looking at the leachates – liquid that has passed through the tyre material, taking some of the harmful chemicals with it – they found a strong presence of zinc, titanium and strontium as well as many organic chemicals. Overall, of the numerous organic chemicals present during the test, more than 50 were found across all five tyre brands, with a significant number of those chemicals classified as very toxic.”\n\nOk just a water flea, but symptomatic of the issue.",

Not only would these blocks melt snow but they would warn drivers of animals or car accidents. I thought that invention was the most incredible thing. I wonder what ever happened to that? The last I remembered, was people complaining about light pollution and they questioned the longevity of the product.\n\nIt's just completely nuts that we drive on outdated roadways. It's the year 2024 and can't even get traffic lights to sense if there's anyone on the other side, so we don't have to sit at a red light for 5-10 minutes.",
