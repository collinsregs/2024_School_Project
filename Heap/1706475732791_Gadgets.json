This, needless to say, greatly saves on time, labor and money, which in turn saves customers millions of dollars per launch. Relativity intends for its rockets to carry large payloads, too, up to the size of a small car, which is six times the capability of its competitors, according to the company.\n\n‚Äã\n\nRelativity unveils Stargate 4th Generation metal 3D printer with horizontal printing capability\n\nhttps://www.tctmagazine.com/additive-manufacturing-3d-printing-news/metal-additive-manufacturing-news/relativity-unveils-stargate-4th-generation-metal-3d-printer-/\n\n‚Äã\n\nNew Stargate Generation boasts horizontal printing to enable the additive manufacture of larger components.\nRelativity says 4th Generation achieves¬†an increased volume capacity of 55x compared to¬†its 3rd generation predecessor.\nSeveral Stargate 4th Generation printers already online with more than a dozen¬†to be printing Terran R parts in coming months.\n\nWhile the Stargate 4th Generation technology will underpin the development and production of Terran R in the short-term, Relativity believes in the longer-term the new system will ‚Äòoffer tremendous value-generating potential for other end-product use cases within the $1T aerospace, aviation, energy and defence industries‚Äô as the core of a new tech stack for aerospace products.",
