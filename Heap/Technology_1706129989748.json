This happened to Alaska Airlines. It happened to our guests and happened to our people. And — my demand on Boeing is what are they going to do to improve their quality programs in-house.”\n\n• “We’re sending our audit people to audit their quality control systems and processes to make sure that every aircraft that comes off that production line, that comes to Alaska has the highest levels of excellence and quality,” he said.",

Plus most sub services offer discounts when you threaten to cancel so we rarely pay more that 50% ish of the value of most services since we review them monthly, cancel for real the ones we didn't want. And get discounts on the ones we keep.\n\nAmazon prime video channels also often goes on sale with deals like 1.99 per month for 3 months. For these we just wait until that happens, sign up, watch whatever, and by the end of the deal if you wanna cancel you do, but often they extend the deal and you can keep going if there is more you're invested in watching.",

Prime video was sweet back when they offered digital credits for slower shipping before covid hit. We got quite a few movies and tv series purchases.\n\nThey still offer them but it’s few and far between.

Is the current situation the utopia of streaming you always wanted? No, welcome to reality. Is it amazing compared to cable? Absolutely. Is it deteriorating in quality?

The number of people who were actually sued is even smaller than that. Young people don’t change their behavior is very often simply because they see a story in the newspaper about some other person getting arrested for something they are doing.\n\nThe original streaming version of Netflix made piracy more trouble that was worth. That’s why people stopped doing it. Why spend hours downloading various movies and shows if virtually everything you want is already available for a relatively nominal amount? Put simply, it became less convenient to pirate when viewed in the context of money to effort.\n\nNow, the selection sucks and the pricing tiers are asinine. Every Tom Dick and Harry has a streaming service - Disney, Netflix, Universal, etc etc. Options are incredibly limited unless you’re willing to spend $$$ and there’s no one service that has almost everything anymore… except pirating.\n\nSo yeah, now that they have made it more difficult to watch shows without paying multiple businesses through the nose to do so, it’s logical that piracy will rise.\n\nThat’s not even factoring in how prevalent VPNs are now. For $3 a month you can get with no contract you can get a good VPN that’s perfectly fine for this sort of stuff from somewhere like Windscribe. Hell, they even give you 10 gigs free a month even without being a paying customer… which means the number of people who are actually going to get caught will be cut proportionally even if we assume the RIAA steps up enforcement.",

Blockbuster's playbook failed because they argued that streaming a video is like renting a VCR tape or DVD, and that they could stream their entire catalogue of movies without paying additional licensing/royalty fees.

The brownouts were what was keeping them afloat and staving off suspicion from investors.\n\nThe audits were triggered because Enron was using mark-to-market accounting (which was 100% legal, by the way). Traditionally a business waits until they actually realize profits before they report them to investors. However with mark-to-market accounting you report your expected revenues at the beginning of a project/deal, and then make any necessary corrections once you realize those revenues.\n\nHowever, Enron was not actually doing their due diligence and adjusting the valuations of those projects over time. When the deal with Blockbuster fell through, Enron was forced to write-off the entire thing all at once since they couldn't claim any future revenue on a project that no longer exists. Billions of dollars of reported assets disappeared over night which spooked investors. Investors demanded thorough audits to figure out how much Enron was actually worth. And as it turns out, the answer was \"not much\".",

Couldn't find people to fill positions? etc.?\n\nNow companies, not just TikTok are shedding staff, left and right.\n\nAnd people wonder why less people \"want\" to work, there's no point if you're on the chopping block every day, waiting for when, not if, you'll lose your job. Yet we're all expected to give a 2weeks notice if we're leaving. At least these announcements, like Tik Tok, is giving a heads up. Many other companies just do it and then it hits the news.\n\nThere's no job loyalty, partially because of the workers, yes, but mostly because of the employers.\n\nPay raises are less than inflation. Benefits, though optional, are a joke, or becomes a growing joke as the employers cheapen the options to be next to useless and/or useless and yet costly (health insurance).\n\n\"No burger flipper should make more than I, I went to college!\" Dude, if you're that dense, you're the one manipulated too, and you don't know it. You're paid below what you should be making, and you're basing your well earned pay on burger flippers? Check your position across the state/country.\n\nThere's IT support and management staff in rural areas of the US are paid close to what Walmart Associates start at or lower. I kid you not. I could go 100% remote IT, and that's a hellscape of drama and stress, I'm not willing to deal with; it's 100% my choice and opinion, and I support those who do remote work. I do in person, some remote, and walk in IT support; I make less than Walmart Associates now, wasn't 10 years ago. Why haven't I gone back to Walmart? Ask them why they slowed or stopped hiring, app been in for nearing a year, updated monthly (I forgot in Dec, that's on me). I'm not the only one been waiting to hear back. There's now no other IT job in town unless I work for a corporation that's servicing people in town, but offices are miles away; nearest \"city\" is over an hour drive away, lol.",

Most software has bugs in it, often important ones that give wrong answers, lead to data being stolen, or lead to sums not adding up.\n\nThe problem is that, when the Post Office learned that their expensive software rollout wasn't working... they responded by accusing the people running the offices as fraud. When the people blamed the system, the Post Office investigators told them that no-one else had reported bugs like these. The investigators repeated those lines to hundreds of people over more than a decade - despite the investigations being run and reviewed by a relatively small group of people, who must have known those statements were untrue.\n\nThen the Post Office management took these people to court, and continued to lie, and got hundreds of them convicted of fraud based on evidence many of the Post Office investigators and management must have known to be untrue.\n\nThe scandal isn't buggy software - it's the dishonest investigations and prosecutions, that appear to have started simply from being too embarrased to admit that a software rollout was an expensive mistake.\n\nFujitsu should be held to account not for their lack of quality control, but rather for supporting these prosecutions and providing witness statements that they knew were misleadingly incomplete; for seeing what was happening and staying silent; for helping their customer get away with this when they had the knowledge to expose the Post Office management's lies.",

        "comment": "Some key points below:\n\nThe robots in question were designed by California robotics firm FigureAI and are described as being “general purpose”—meaning they can be used for any number of physical tasks. The bipedal bot, which is simply dubbed the “Figure 01,” stands 5'6\" tall, weighs 130 pounds, and has five-fingered hands that the company claims can be used to physically construct objects. On its YouTube channel, Figure has a video of the robot making coffee. Another video shows the bot swiftly walking across a room using its two sturdy legs.\n\nThat said, it’s not entirely clear what the bots will actually be doing in this case. The related press release speaks of the “deployment of humanoid robots in an automotive manufacturing environment” and claims the robots will focus on “difficult, unsafe, or tedious tasks,” all of which sounds pretty vague.\n\nThe press release further states that, as part of the first phase of the deal, the two companies will work together to “identify initial use cases to apply the Figure robots in automotive production.” Again, the wording here sorta makes it sound like both companies are a bit unclear on what the robots will actually be doing. After the two firms finally agree on what the Figure 01 can do, some of the bots will be deployed to one of BMW’s manufacturing facilities in Spartanburg, South Carolina.\n\n...\n\nTech companies throughout the world are currently in a race to churn out the first generation of “humanoid” robots. While robots have helped out in factories and warehouses for years, the human form factor of this newer iteration of robots is thought to have many added benefits for more complicated forms of industrial work. This has, of course, spurred concerns that the robots will (eventually) take a lot of human jobs. Figure’s CEO has claimed that his company has no interest in taking jobs away from people—which is, of course, what he would say.\n\nWishy-washy press releases aside, from a technical perspective it will be interesting to see what these humanoid robots are capable of, especially in a more general sense; but from a social side it's clear that this has the potential to negatively impact the lives of many people.",

It was perfect for photos.\n\nBut they've increased prices in 2022 to 3,99€/50 pages and now to 4,99€/50 pages (0,10€/page). That's insane.\n\nI am switching to 3rd party cartridges now.",

Neither myself nor anyone I know who has some morals left, recommends HP printers anymore. Why should we? There are so many better alternatives. That don’t brick your machine. That don’t price their ink and toner so high. That don’t force you to install a printer via an app or WiFi.

The research, published today in the journal PNAS Nexus, is the first quantitative scientific analysis that predicts how bad actors will misuse AI globally.\n“Everybody is talking about the dangers of AI, but until our study there was no science of this threat,” Neil Johnson, lead study author and a professor of physics at GW, says. “You cannot win a battle without a deep understanding of the battlefield.”",

I blame whoever the executive is that thought it was a good idea to approach it this way in the first place.\n\nPeople are stupid but they’re not quite that stupid. Generally, someone knows when they’re being thrown a sales pitch disguised as something else - and generally it’s not appreciated.\n\nWhen you start treating your fan base like cash cows instead of players, Riot Forge is what happens.

So if you know of one, their security is good because their brand reached you.\nThe US military has more money than god and knows how to hire good admins. When they need a blacksite secured, they fucking do it right, even if they need to have internet accessibility.\nBEST: medium sized companies that have recently seen financial success, and US federal gov't stuff.\nenough cash to get proper hardware, an IT team that isn't overworked, and a small amount of exposure to threats, because the company isn't that huge yet.\nalso more money than god, but they can't pay like the military can, and more exposed. Usually quite good though.\nGOOD: extremely large companies that have been hacked recently, state level governments.\nthe government is breathing down their neck and threatening audits, so they throw their huge amounts of money at the issues, and are willing to hire good admins - but there's still a lot of points of exposure.\nStates have enough money and know they need good IT teams. Not as much money though.\nFINE, I GUESS: large and extremely large companies without a recent breach. Major City Gov't.\nthey've got the money, but it often has to be pried from their hands. Usually they realize why they need to spend it, but it takes a good admin team and good management to use it well - plus they have a lot of exposure.\nNOT FINE: bad companies. You know the ones. Usually large, and always in court, always doing some shlocky ad push to get positive attention going their way. Usually led by the worst humans imaginable. County level gov't.\nNo budget. Owner's cousin does IT because he's a gamer.\nmost counties outside of major cities (so...most counties) have gov't infrastructure could be breached by an 8th grader with a can of monster and an internet connection. This is because they don't have the money for good admins or good hardware, so IT is actively looking for other jobs.\nBAD: small companies that suddenly hit on some viral thing and now they have to expand faster than their IT can handle.\nthey don't know who to hire, so they hire people bad at their jobs. These people don't know how to set it all up. Combined with a shitload of new employees, their exposire to threats is also huge. they will have a breach, and it will be soon.\nBREACH IMMINENT: tech bros that started a company because of their Awesome Idea (TM).\nthey don't have money, they think they can do the tech, and really they are just going to suddenly get big and have money...but no they aren't. They have no plan.\nTHE FUCKING WORST: the sheriff's department way out in the country.\nnot kidding. if there's a sheriff in your community and you live more than 50 miles from a city with a population of at least 100k, Your data might be literally plastered up on a signboard outside their building right now.\nI don't know what it is about these guys. Just holy shit it's like they are paid to ignore IT security. And their \"IT guy\" is some old lady that used to be a secretary for the county gov't, lost that job because she couldn't juggle the shifts with her Local Diner (tm) job, and now does IT under the table for the sheriff's office. Or maybe there's literally a horse doing IT. IDK.\nthey always have a bad fucking attitude about it, too. Like, dude calm down I'm trying to fix your shit, shut up.",

Maybe it's because small businesses arguably remain the lifeline of a greater capitalism, and they have the most \"make it or break it\" potential. Perhaps naively, there's also a similar number of small IT security businesses trying to \"make it or break it,\" and the small non-security businesses can't necessarily afford the big security players, so they turn to the small security businesses. The small security businesses that prove successful and have good management quickly move up to the \"fine, I guess\" category and perhaps out of the budget of the small businesses seeking their services.\n\nThat's a lot of words to say, \"seems to me finding affordable yet competent small security companies as a small business yourself is a real challenge.\" Or, conversely, \"how many mid- to large-tier, competent security businesses are able to offer an affordable yet entirely useful service to small businesses?\"",

Nevertheless, don't be surprised if instances of attempted and successful account hacks increase over the next few weeks.\n\nThere's a lot of duplicates, and a lot of older stolen account credentials. Yes, there's some new unique stuff, but that's maybe 71 million accounts according to this article. The only thing interesting about this is somebody's packaged all of it together into a single database.",

And that they need to stop shaming their family. Once you start in on the mother and family stuff, they usually crack and say nasty stuff that will get them flagged.

Normal cable TV channels like Discovery, TNT, etc. are akin to websites and other content that you don't pay to access but are supported with ads. \n\nWe are now in the realm of paying for premium TV channels WITH advertising.

BUT, the first 13 channels of cable did have to be offered for free to local broadcast channels (PBS, Local NBC/CBS affiliates, etc.).\n\nThen, advertising went to the content creators...IE the stations. Ads paid for your content, your cable subscription paid to get the content to you. In the end, the stations also paid the cable company to be allowed to be sendicated across their network.",

I don't even watch it. The last netflix show I watched was over a year ago. My sisters occasionally watch, so I paid for the max screens and quality so they could watch. The second one of them got hit with the \"log in at home to keep watching\" thing, we were done. I cancelled it within 5 minutes of getting the text from one of my sisters.

Its great for kids as its easy for them to navigate and use, plenty of decent shows for them. Me and my wife only watch about an hour of tv a night if that so we're not binge watching hours of TV at once like some people. Which means there is always plenty of content on there to keep us happy. I also like the really varied range of films and shows they have because when i'm in the mood for watching something different there is nearly always something to take my fancy. It helps that I'm not the kind of person that watches the latest films the moment they release either. I suspect i'm not alone and reckon a lot of redditors are young and have very different viewing habits to the majority that do have netflix",

I recommend clients of mine do not use them anymore, because working with them has been a nightmare.\n\nThere is no doom / gloom here. SAP is just changing the way it does business, maybe for the better.",

If a better method for detecting fakes arises, it will be used to improve the fakes until the new method can't tell the difference anymore.\n\nThis is why training data poisoning works, if AI generated works make their way into the training data, the AI detecting fakes has greater trouble telling real from fake, because some of what it thinks is real is fake.",

It isn't clock time that wears out an airplane, but stress cycles on the wings and fuselage.\n\nWings in flight are holding up the whole plane. Sitting on the ground they are hanging from the landing gear and bending down. The cabin has the same pressure as outside on the ground, but is pressurized at altitude.\n\nThe stress cycles can cause cracks in the metal frame, which if not caught by inspection could lead to failure.\n\nSo if a 757 flies twice a day on medium routes, you would expect it to last 20,000 days = 55 years.",

I love how I was an awarded mechanic there (I was actually good and didn't fuck anything up, unlike a clear majority of my peers, I take pride in my work always) and yet was ostracized and discriminated against solely because I'm a woman.\n\nBoeing is a fkn joke, lmao, and WOW look at them just fucking everything up, like I said. Like I told HR. Like I told QA, management, ethics, etc. I was called a liar and a bitch by a ton of men, but look! Their \"craftsmanship\" is falling apart in the sky! Well, isn't that great. Being right isn't always fun, and I've BEEN blowing that whistle, yall.\n\nI tried to keep you and your families safe, and I was made to be unsafe and mistreated at my workplace for doing so. I tried, just so someone in the internet abyss knows. This shit is scary and I tried, yall. I blew the fuck out of that whistle and was harmed in return. I didnt care, I still tried, it's bigger than me. I tried, yall. I really did. RIP in advance 🙏 in the most respectful way i can say that. Don't fly people. This is coming from a mechanic who has worked there twice for a total of ten years, ten years apart. It got worse, and we are not safe on Boeing airplanes. I have been trying to blow the fuck out of this whistle for years.\n\nE: I worked there TWICE and i never fly. Not even airbus. They're not much better, we'll hear stories too eventually of airbus planes falling apart. Don't fly right now yall. Please. I'm doing my part. Don't fly til this shit is sorted. This is coming from a mechanic who worked there TWO times, ten years APART, for a DECADE, TOTAL. DO NOT FLY IF YOU DONT WANT TO D-E. IM SORRY TO BE SO BLUNT BUT LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING. take it from someone who was on the inside and all up in it, please, keep your families safe 🙏 i stg if i see one more story of someone putting their little kid on an airplane alone to fly to grammas or whatever im gonna lose it 😭😭 this shit is giving me goddamn nightmares, i'm doing my part. Don't fly yall. Please. No one needs to see your face that bad. It could be the last time anyone sees your face. I'm f-cking serious. I have nothing to gain or lose from this, I'm trying to spread the word because the news showing these things literally falling apart still isn't deterring people. No one needs to see you that bad in a world where you can video chat and fly later. Gonna be crass again WARNING but even if the person you're gonna go see is dying, what, is you dying on your way to see them helpful at all? They're already on their way out, if you have kids or otherwise no one needs to see your face more than the minors you had or etc. I'd say the only risk worth flying is for your offspring, currently.\n\nBoeing airplanes are not safe. Airbus is not either but the news isn't reporting their transgressions just yet.\n\nPlease spare yourselves. Please fucking spare your kids and yourselves. Don't put your kids on these planes if you actually care about them. How fun is Disneyland gonna be if everyone d-es in a plane crash on the way there? Probably gonna be kicking your own ass if you even survive. Please think ten seconds ahead, ten minutes, ten days...educate yourselves, don't subject your helpless children to an unsafe environment, don't subject gramma or grandpa to this, don't subject YOURSELVES to this possibility. I'm pleading with humanity in this stupid comment on reddit to PLEASE USE YOUR HEADS AND PLEASE BE SAFE. DO. NOT. FLY. ANYTHING. RIGHT NOW. TRAGEDIES ARE ON THE HORIZON. PLEASE. DO. NOT. FLY.",

For example, I just asked a Llama bot for your most recent employment history, and it responded with :\n\nName: Rnilf (Red)\n\nPosition: Software Engineer III\n\nEmployer: TechnoTect Inc.\n\nDuration: 01/2020 - present (3 years)\n\nResponsibilities: Develop and maintain software solutions for clients in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. Collaborate with cross-functional teams to design, implement, and test software systems. Maintain code quality by writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code.\n\nI'm gonna go out on a limb here and assume that this is factually incorrect. AI is extremely unreliable at performing research, particularly about private individuals, but even for celebrities, it will just randomly make shit up. Using it for social engineering would be extremely risky because instead of digging up super-secret personal information about someone, you could end up digging up pure bullshit which will be a giant red flag.",

My name is Prince Amara Eze, a noble and benevolent soul from the esteemed Eze royal family in Lagos, Nigeria. I hope this email reaches you well and brings a sense of curiosity and wonder.\nI am writing to share with you a tale that has unfolded in the heart of our vibrant city, a story of unexpected fortune and the enduring spirit of generosity. Recently, a team of explorers made a remarkable discovery beneath the grounds of our palace—an ancient treasure valued at an astounding 10 billion dollars.\nIn light of this discovery, our kingdom's elders unveiled a prophecy that spoke of a generous prince who would inherit this wealth and be tasked with sharing it with someone beyond our borders. As fate would have it, I have been chosen to fulfill this noble responsibility.\nDriven by a deep sense of humility and kindness, I have sought guidance from our kingdom's scholars to understand the true purpose of this treasure. It is not merely wealth but a symbol of prosperity meant to be shared with the world. With the elders' blessings, I am reaching out to you—an unsuspecting recipient chosen by destiny.\nI believe that this extraordinary journey is an opportunity for us to form a unique bond, transcending borders and cultures. Together, we can embark on a quest to distribute this wealth wisely, supporting charitable causes, uplifting communities, and leaving a legacy that echoes the generosity of the Eze royal family.\nI understand that this message may come as a surprise, and the tale I share may seem like a fable. However, I assure you that the sincerity of my intentions is genuine, and I am eager to explore the possibilities that this unexpected fortune presents.\nIf you find yourself intrigued by this proposition and open to the idea of joining me on this journey, please respond to this email at your earliest convenience. I look forward to the potential of making a positive impact together.\nWishing you prosperity and joy,\nPrince Amara Eze",

It turns out that one of the easiest of these strong emotions to trigger is outrage. We are easily outraged by whatever thing somebody in some \"out group\" has done or said.

We are not going to get UBI, unless we make it an issue worth voting about. And we are not going to get enough people to vote for it until they recognize how many people will lose their jobs to it. This is most likely going to be a slow boil seeing how we seem to only every react when the danger seems to be literally at our doorstep.\n\nWe should be worried about AI. Not in the form it is now, but the form it can take in the near future (next 2 decades). It would be idiotic not to. Even AI as it stands right now can already be used like many other existing tools to facilitate the spreading of misinformation in a way that's cheaper and therefore easier to scale out. Meaning it can and will and probably already is being used as a propaganda tool in wars.\n\nBut if you want to just chalk up the final nail in the coffin for reliable news as more of the same, there's the fact that the boundaries we have with current AI, not everyone creating AIs them will implement them. We will start to see improvements in the technical limits, like context length, computational costs, scalability etc... That will make creating AIs even closer to something just anybody can do.\n\nThis will mean that making the AI be autonomous and not require a human on the other side will become plausible. When you have people tinkering with that, which is a very seductive thing to try, that's when you start to have the possibility of AIs building smarter but unaligned AIs without human supervision with some real chances at successful. It seems fantastical right now, but that tipping point might as well be midnight. Once that's started there's no putting the genie back into the bottle.\n\nI love the advent of llms. I genuinely do.

Except the AI is an opaque system; you can't examine its logic, nor edit individual decision-points. Because it's slightly more accurate, though, companies will feel they must adopt the technologies, even when that means your insurance provider is now back to doing racial discrimination but they can blame the unknowable AI algorithm rather than accept responsibility for their regression. In other cases, you have safety-critical algorithms that may now exhibit risky glitches, even if it's better on average.\n\nThe lesser-but-still-significant threat lies in automating tasks involving some amount of creativity, that software couldn't compete on previously. Generating art for product packaging alone could easily displace hundreds of thousands of graphic designers. With all the other jobs that'd be affected, from cases where a team of 5 can get \"good enough\" results with only 3 members plus ChatGPT, to cases where a manager decides they can just order the AI around the way they ordered humans and so cuts the entire team, you would get a cascade of unemployment in one area driving down wages for the remaining jobs out of desperation, then the workers displaced from those positions by someone willing to do the same work for less pay move on to the next employer, and so on. Unlike past technological advancements, there isn't going to be a gradual rollout constrained by the rate new machines and tools could be manufactured and installed; it's all software that can be deployed in minutes. Unlike past technological advancements, the displaced workers can't move into more-creative positions putting their brains to use in ways the machines can't; this is all about automating the thinky bits.\n\n(inb4 buggy whip analogy: managers are the buggy whip makers. The humans working under them are the horses who, without widespread employment, have largely died off and only occupy a small niche these days, mostly as a hobby.)",

Bull bull bull!\n\nThe average person, I'd bet 75% of the people in my \"small\" town hardly use a TB of data, because they don't rely on the internet, most are likely older people who are content in their ways (nothing wrong), and not relying on the internet.\n\nThe others are people who depend on it, both entertainment, yes games, and word.\n\nMy house of three adults and one child, we easily break 4TB every month, with Disney+ going, youtube, game and console/computer updates, and just overall playing games. Heck, I socialize in VR at least once a week, I'm constantly download avatars of players as they change avatars, join/leave instances, and when I change worlds/instances I'm downloading various content again.\n\nNot only that, a lot of websites and internet based applications are poor optimizations for use. There's a lot of web page content you don't see with your eyes, stuck in the background waiting to be triggered, press play, or left behind but never fully removed. Games are the same way, on a larger scale. Even Auto play videos on websites, namely news sites, are a waste of internet activity.\n\nThen there's the people with IOT with cameras, that can easily take a chunk, worse if not setup properly. Devices like smart tvs, even when powered off, but still plugged in, chatting on the internet (varying results, usually very low).",

It's like saying you should have a cap on your fuel, electricity, water.\n\nIs there bad apples out there? Certainly. Not near enough to cause everyone else to be punished. I'm in a house of three adults and a toddler. Disney+ alone, 1080p, is close to, if not exceeding, 1TB each month. Add in computer/console/mobile updates, game and app updates, cloud storage management (backups or otherwise), and let's toss in IOT, you can easily break 750GB a month in a family home. That doesn't leave you much room for everything else, say face time, facebook videos (just videos, text based doesn't take much), youtube, and to a limited degree if guests use your internet.\n\nMost people don't know what takes how much data. I've had people think just visiting Facebook takes up a lot of data, no, videos on facebook and other platforms.\n\nThis is greed and manipulation at the core.\n\nThe bad apples? Those are the people running servers at home for (mainly) internet use. I have a server at home, 90% or more of it's use is local only. I might stream videos or music off it while I'm out of the house, but hardly enough to warrant any alarms.\n\nPeople setting up IOT cameras that stream to the cloud? Those should be on an ISP that can handle that constant activity on the internet, namely Wired internet connections if possible (physical and cost limitations in mind). My \"IOT\" cameras stay local, only stream out if I decide to view one of the cameras.\n\nThis whole 1GB data cap has been a common place limit all over for years. I wouldn't be so annoyed if it was say 5TB. Some time around the third quarter last year, I seen we had exceeded 4TB. Where did most of that come from? Video Streaming at the top of that list, followed by game updates (Call Of Duty and Boulders Gate 3), and usual chatter after that. We don't stream 4k mind you, unless Disney+ is pushing 4k on our 1080p TV.",

The people pushing for these laws are not techies, but concerned parents, and this is exactly the right audience to right such an article for.\n\nPlaying the devil's advocate, I feel like some of the pro-arguments aren't quite so convincing, at least to me. Obviously I agree with the article's thesis, I'm just not so sure that \"undermining the free expression rights of teens and everyone else in the process\" is as compelling as I'd like it to be.\n\nBut overall, this reads like a well balanced and accessible article on a topic which is easily full of minefields. If I had a friend who was concerned, this is an article that I can share. The authors of the article deserve a pat on the back for a job well done.",

Then today as we are about to finish the day, they call us up for a meeting and they just send us home with no real information. Just said go home, we started late tomorrow don’t worry about what’s on the line and we’ll have lunch for yall tomorrow. Idk if I still have a job, and if I do idk what’s about to change. That email that got sent out? Yea it only got sent out to our work emails which anyone that’s not a supervisor or above has access to.

This is unsustainable\n\nIn Europe, you can hire like 2 people for each person in California.\n\nThis was long time coming. The wage difference between US and its peers in the western world got too high.\n\nTech salaries for software in California have gone up by more than 150% in the last decade\n\nThe second big reason could be sec 175 amendments. Until 2021, you could write off 100% if employee salaries on your top line and subtract that from taxable income. That changed. Now it’s 20%.\n\nSo if you are google, that makes $100 billion before paying salaries, and salaries cost $50 billion, you could subtract the 50 from the 100 billion and you pay taxes on the remaining 50.\n\nFrom last year, google can only subtract 20% of the $50 billion in salaries from the 100, and has to pay taxes on the $90 billion.\n\nCompanies would hire like crazy as they could get tax write off from these salaries.

Was that startup CEO and board sitting in on the same Bilderberg meeting your conspiracy theory (without proof mind you) points to? Or is it more likely they looked at their run way, looked that their prospects for raising their next series of funding in a tightening lending environment, looked at their books, looked at the output and staff and said \"we need to do layoffs and create more runway\". For reference, the CEO was axed too, I guess that must have come from the Bilderberg meeting he didn't know about.\n\nBut hey, if a conspiracy theory helps simplify the world for you then do what you have to do.\n\nP.s. After the layoff, I went and got a job for the same pay. Satisfied with my work, they gave me a raise exceeding what I made at the last gig. I guess they didn't get the Bilderberg memo...

Edit: \"Its myopic focus on a single attribute of the video, the title, leaves every other meaningful aspect of viewer privacy unprotected,\" Patreon's court filing said, concluding that \"ultimately the VPPA’s flaw is not just that it fails to address 'all aspects of [the] problem,' its flaw is that it fails to directly address the supposed problem at all.\" This argument is infuriating. They pretend the law doesn’t go far enough while arguing be even less stringent and they should be able to tell anyone what you watched/listened to as a result. Fuck these people.",

It doesn't matter if you think it's a sport or not because as an entertainment property, it functions as a live sport. Thats why Fox paid to put them on primetime every Friday night. Thats why Peacock paid to put their network catalog and their monthly premium events on there. There is no other non sport property that you are paying 5 billion dollars to put on your platform.\n\nThe point is, if they are willing to do that, they will be in the hunt for any live entertainment negotiations in the future.

        "comment": "[article text]\n\nAmazon France Logistique, which manages the company's warehouses in France, set up \"an excessively intrusive system for monitoring the activity and performance of employees\", said the French data protection agency CNIL.\n\nThe finding follows an inquiry set up in 2019 after a complaint from workers which was subsequently reported in the media.\n\nWatchdog CNIL fined the company €32 million, the equivalent of about 3% of its annual revenue which reached €1.1 billion in 2021. Amazon France Logistique employs around 20,000 staff in France.\n\nThe practice labelled as illegal\n\nThe watchdog said Amazon's French company had put in place scanners for its workers, to document in real-time how long it took to carry out certain tasks.\n\nThis meant that, in certain situations, employees being monitored by the scanners potentially had to justify the breaks they were taking.\n\nAnother mode of surveillance looked at the time workers took to quality-check articles, with the target set at a minimum window of 1.25 seconds.\n\nIf the time allocated fell below the threshold, Amazon considered the check to be insufficient.\n\nThe watchdog also found that Amazon's practices breached the EU's general data protection regulation (GDPR) which imposes strict rules on companies for obtaining consent on how personal information is used.\n\nThe CNIL considered it was excessive that Amazon kept all data collected by the system for all employees and temporary workers for a 31-day period.\n\nAmazon reserves the right to appeal\n\nReacting to the decision, Amazon said in a statement, it \"strongly disagrees with the CNIL's conclusions which are factually incorrect\", adding it reserved the right to appeal.\n\nAmazon had argued the use of warehouse management systems was standard industry practice and its systems complied with applicable European and French regulations.\n\nThe tech giant also noted it had worked constructively with the CNIL throughout the procedure to respond to the questions raised.\n\nThe tech giant is known for its stringent standards in the world of e-commerce, asking workers to deliver packages in 24 hours.\n\nAmazon says such efficiency would be impossible without the use of the scanners, as it aims to move tens of thousands of items constantly whilst also ensuring minimum quality standards.\n\nIt is not the first time Amazon has faced serious backlash in France. The tech giant in 2020 temporarily suspended all activity in the country after a French court found it was not doing enough to protect its workers from the Covid-19 virus.",

Although Bush won in some recounts Gore won in others. The different results is dependent on the standard one used for the recount, hanging chads, dimpled ballots, undervotes, over votes. The count the Supreme Court stopped was a recount of only certain counties and bush would have still been the winner. If the set of 4 standard were to be applied to the entire state Gore won every time. This doesn’t even take in Broward county butterfly ballots which led to pat Buchanan having more support per capita in that county then the Florida panhandle. Even Buchanan said that’s not believable leading him to say, “those aren’t my people” by which he meant the Jews. Sorry to the Wikipedia article but it is arguably the best aggregator of the data.

I've seen optical scanners used for standardized test grading and elections since the 1980s with no particular problems.\n\nWhen it comes to the higher tech voting machines, a programmer friend of mine was an election volunteer in (Chicago?) in the 2004 elections. Her district had purchased electronic machines in a response to the \"hanging chad\" problem.\n\nThey assumed that if it was tech, it was accurate, not understanding that software can be programmed to do just about anything, including let someone enter a vote for candidate A while incrementing the actual vote count for candidate B.\n\nShe was the only person who knew anything about software and she poked around and discovered the machine had been preloaded with 2000 votes for Bush. She erased the preloaded votes but couldn't get anyone to listen to or care about her story.\n\nSince then I've been extra-biased against voting machines.",

It’s a trade off between being able to have a secret ballot and being able to prove your vote was counted as cast.\n\nThis is one reason I feel like a paper trail is always important. If you visually see on paper how your vote is cast and then drop that in a box to be counted it’s much harder to cheat the system.\n\nHow can we verify all votes came from registered citizens?\n\nBallots are only given to registered citizens.

I for one have never been able to get any traction on the topic of the 2004 Presidential election being stolen, even though we know exactly how they did it.\n\nI lived in Ohio at the time. This happened. I watched with thousands of others as the tallying system went down late on election night, and came back up with a massive swing toward Bush.\n\nThat article tells you exactly how they did it, and exactly why the setup was so problematic in the first place.\n\nThis is not a conspiracy theory. We know Republicans steal elections. This is one time they got caught red-handed, and yet we did nothing about it.\n\nThough somebody did try.\n\nOn January 6, 2005, Senator Barbara Boxer joined Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio in filing a Congressional objection to the certification of Ohio's Electoral College votes due to alleged irregularities... The Senate voted the objection down 74–1; the House voted the objection down 267–31. At the time, it was only the second Congressional objection to an entire State's electoral delegation in U.S. history;\n\nThe reason this lawsuit went nowhere is that the IT guy called to testify was murdered in a plane crash.\n\nFollowing Last Friday's fatal accident, CBS Affiliate WOIO reported that Connell, who had recently been subpoenaed to testify in relation to a lawsuit alleging vote rigging in the 2004 Ohio election, was warned at least twice about flying his plane because his plane might be sabotaged.\n\nand I'll just add this:\n\nQuestions have also been raised about how votes from Ohio counties were tabulated. Computer expert Stephen Spoonamore, a Republican who works in detecting fraud in network architecture and protecting computer infrastructures, has testified that the Ohio election returns he saw were indicative of a \"KingPin Attack,\" in which a computer is inserted into the communications flow of an IT system, with the intent to change data as it passes to its destination.\n\nIt was later learned that Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell's office had routed Internet traffic from county election offices through out-of-state servers based at SMARTech in Chattanooga, Tenn. SMARTech hosts dozens of GOP Web domains.\n\nGeorge Bush did not win Ohio in 2004, and therefore did not win the 2004 presidential election. Republicans altered votes to give him that win.\n\nIt is insane we don't talk more about this.",

It identified risks that are theoretical and imaginary. Our security measures are real and mitigate all of them,\" Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger wrote in a letter to state lawmakers, which Raffensperger's office shared with NBC News.\n\nHe continued: \"Is it possible for a team of bad actors to break into Georgia’s 2,700 voting precincts, install malware that changes election outcomes on 35,000 pieces of equipment, and sneak back out — all the while being undetected and leaving no trace? I’ll put it this way: It’s more likely that I could win the lottery without buying a ticket.\"\n\nMike Hassinger, a spokesman for Raffensperger's office, said Friday that responding to this report all day felt like he was \"stuck in a Dumb and Dumber paradox,\" referencing a character's response to a one in a million likelihood: \"So, you're telling me there's a chance?\"\n\nElection cybersecurity experts have long struggled with how to characterize the vulnerabilities they find in voting equipment. Such flaws are usually rarely possible to exploit in an actual election, especially at a scale that could change results, and they can be used by election denialists as fuel for outlandish claims.",

In 40 of 41 drawings, Caputo happened to pick his fellow Democrats for the preferred placement which carried odds of less than 1 in 50 billion. Despite the sheer unlikelihood of those odds, the plaintiffs were never able to figure out how Caputo had cheated and thus failed in their suit.\n\nSo this is a reason to fix the machines, but no one should start re-litigating past elections without proof that such tampering actually happened.",

He flipped the winner in a theoretical election between President George Washington and Benedict Arnold, the Revolutionary War general who defected to the British. He rigged the machine to print out as many ballots as he wanted.\n\n• All he needed was a pen to reach a button inside the touchscreen, a fake $10 voter card he had programmed, or a $100 USB device that he plugged into a cord connected to a printer, rewriting the touchscreen’s code.\n\n \n\n• Halderman delivered his presentation during an election security trial evaluating whether Georgia’s voting system is vulnerable to manipulation or programming errors. All in-person voters in Georgia make their choices on touchscreens that print out paper ballots.\n\n• Halderman testified that he discovered vulnerabilities after he was given access to a Fulton County touchscreen, called a ballot-marking device, as an expert witness in the case.\n\n• He reported his findings to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, which validated the technology weaknesses in June 2022.\n\n(Also see https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.gand.240678/gov.uscourts.gand.240678.1681.0.pdf)",

You verify against what you put in on the screen, and the paper ballot is what *truly* should matter/be counted by some kind of offline machine (or people, etc...) if it's automated.\n\n​\n\nThis is mitigated by election workers reminding you to check your ballot to make sure it's accurate. And not relying on barcode, but other obvious machine-readable marks. EG one that's like a scantron form.\n\n​\n\nOn-network 'early' counts/results should be trusted as far as you can throw them.\n\n​\n\nEncourage voters to verify the human-readable votes on printout.\n\n​\n\nThat and...\n\n​\n\nEnsure carefully selected protective and detective physical security measures (for example, locks and tamper-evident seals) are implemented on all affected devices, including on connected devices such as printers and connecting cables.\n\n​\n\nPhysical security/tamper protection & detection are huge ones....\n\n​\n\n(NOTE: If states and jurisdictions so choose, the ImageCast X provides the configuration option to produce ballots that do not print barcodes for tabulation.)\n\ndoes indeed mitigate what I stated above on barcodes, *if* the counting machines can read them without it. (which, they damn well should especially if you use MICR ink/toner or similar technology to make the reading easy).",

So they start talking like they are all going to boycott it, to either convince others to boycott or convince the company it's a bad idea\n\nBut it never amounts to anything\n\nThese are two separate things, and I don't think point one is entirely accurate. I personally have been a LONGGGGGG time subscriber to Netflix (first DVD's and then streaming when it started) and had been up until they started to get gross with their price hikes, removing features (like password sharing) and in general not having a good enough library of content. Not to mention cancelling everything after 3 seasons. In certain posts about Netflix there are literally hundreds of comments from users who have said the same. They cancelled because of Netflix's changes.\n\nBUT, your second point, is accurate. If I was to define \"Reddit Boycott\" it would be when Redditors, a typically more aware and interested sub-culture, boycott something (typically due to a moral stance or anti-corruption) but that boycott is NOT reflected in the outcome of whatever it is they are boycotting. Netflix goes evil? Redditors boycott, cancel, and then the report comes out and Netflix is up 13 mil subs in a business quarter. So it's not that they are all talk, many are sure, but they just don't move the needle and their stances aren't reflective of the general public.",

However, the cost will be far higher once inflation is taken into account, because EDF is using 2015 prices.\n\n​\n\nThe latest in a series of setbacks represents a huge delay to the project’s initial timescale. In 2007, the then EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz said that by Christmas in 2017, turkeys would be cooked using electricity generated from atomic power at Hinkley. When the project was finally given the green light in 2016, its cost was estimated at £18bn.\n“Like other major infrastructure projects, we have found civil construction slower than we hoped and faced inflation, labour and material shortages, on top of Covid and Brexit disruption,” said Stuart Crooks, the project’s managing director, in a message to staff.",

The average for 2015 was 1.5285 to the Pound.\n\nSo. £35B * 1.5285 = $53.4975B 2015 dollars. We then deflate by 1.29 to get $69.011775B 2024 dollars. Roughly double.\n\nNow assuming that inflation is the same for the next eight years as the last eight we multiply by 1.29 again to get $89.02518975B in 2031 dollars.\n\nBut wait. That's assuming that today's price is actually the price and the end of the project is 2031, which is ludicrous since this 10 year project is 8 years (80%) and projected to go 8 more years. A rationalist would call that 50% complete and really expect delivery in 16 years. So we're talking 2039 dollars (x1.29 again) and double the now price. 69.011775B21.29=$178.0503795B.\n\nAnd then after 32 years construction and $178B invested, you can start powering stuff.\n\nAhem. Conclusion: I think I would buy some solar panels and batteries for my house and tell the power company I died when the house burned down, please close the account.",
