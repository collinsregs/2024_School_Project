HTMX enhances this by enabling any HTML element to make HTTP requests, simplifying the development of SPA-like applications without needing to write JavaScript for data fetching. The article walks through creating such components, configuring them externally for flexibility, and integrating with HTMX for dynamic content loading, showcasing the ease and power of combining these technologies.\n\nIf you don't like the summary, just downvote and I'll try to delete the comment eventually üëç\n\nClick here for more info, I read all comments",

But I think it goes in the direction tha OP went - too.\n\nThere‚Äôs no value in a clean and orderly kitchen to the business and end users. I never go to restaurants to view the design, cleanliness and awesome appliances in the kitchen. These have value as a means-to-an-end only. They‚Äôre important, both to the health/safety of the food, the variety of food they allow to produce and the velocity at which it can be prepared.\n\nIt also carries over to the cook. There‚Äôs cooks that make a mess with every dish and produce mediocre results. Experts know how to minimize overhead and focus on food production, either through careful planning, utilization of supporting team members and specialization of roles and tools where it makes sense, yet generalization of most of the work so that bottlenecks can be minimized.\n\nFinally, expert cooks value time tested tools - old knifes, well used pots. But also is not afraid to experiment with new spices and combinations of flavours.\n\nI‚Äôve definitely seen a good share of developers who are so obsessed about clean code that nothing gets done. That doesn‚Äôt mean that design patterns and known solutions to common problems are to be ignored and everything should be hacked without any consideration of structure and architecture.\n\nAs with most things in life, it‚Äôs a balance and a set of tradeoff - and the context of the development work is also very important. An after-hours solo passion project is not like a team of five developers at a startup, which is also different to a large enterprise team.",

We get treated like an expendable cost, but I‚Äôm supposed to also do their job for them by caring about KPIs and their management philosophies?\n\nLet me be clear here (and this might be unpopular on this sub but whatever): I do not care when things ship, I do not care about meeting organizational goals, I get paid the same regardless. And in my (over a decade of) experience, finishing things quickly just means you get more work to do and maybe an attaboy.\n\nYou want me to work harder and ship faster? Pay me by my output. Salary me, ‚Äúown all my time‚Äù (so that what I actually accomplish doesn‚Äôt affect my bottom line) and see how little I care about organizational efficiency. It‚Äôs not my organization and it‚Äôs not my role to care about it. The only real carrot they have is a promotion, but those are significantly easier to get by moving jobs than they are fighting against organizational inertia and budgeting.\n\nThe irony of this situation is that these types of puff pieces usually come from the middle management/agile coach/scrum master level. And the 2 months he quoted to produce a minor feature could probably be cut down to under a month simply by sacking 90% of the people in those fluff roles. How much of those two months consisted of pointless agile rituals that only exist to justify a glut of managers?",

I deal directly with senior management, they trust my opinions, there's no bullshit, everyone's playing towards the same goals (you quickly get found out if you try to play politics or can't actually provide output in a small business).\n\nSo if you're struggling, maybe try that approach?

I'm a pretty firm believer in agile and I truly believe it's better than the alternative that's been offered (waterfall).\n\nI also actually do care about (non arbitrary) deadlines. I care about success even more (and those are not necessarily connected, in fact shitty deadlines cause failure...which is why I like agile since deadlines are supposed to be driven by the backlog and sprint velocity...see the non-arbitrary part of my comment).\n\nThat being said, I'm broke now? I find myself caring less and less about their success or how much work they see done, etc. Why? I can't fight the battle any more. I can't deal with not being allowed to determine my own work because they're not bought into agile and the idea that the engineers get to decide how they're going to do their work. I can't deal with the fact that engineers are literally told we must justify the engineering work we need to do, and then given less than a minute to instill over 15 years of experience and 8 years of education into an explanation for why yes, we really do need to create a microservice to support the ability to migrate across multiple microservices and if we don't there will be things we can't do for you to people who have a questionable idea of what a microservice even is.\n\nessentially, the one thing (my organization at least) hasn't delivered on is trusting the engineer team to do their jobs. instead management and the POs try desperately to control how we do things and what we do, and then when we are forced to do what they want and it doesn't work they just point at us and say \"see, you didn't do your job\". There's no ability to recognize that the decisions they made 3 months ago, that we fought, lead to that outcome and thus no desire to learn from it....so we just blame the engineers then go on with the same thing and get the same outcome.\n\nI just can't do it anymore. I care too much about succeeding in the things I think I can have succeed....so, now I'm trying to learn to just do as I'm told. I'm trying to learn not to care what happens because I can't have a positive impact on it anyway. Going to my boss about this stuff just gets him angry at me, so why try? Why not just do whatever he says. The engineers will just get the blame either way and things won't change either way and I'll get my paycheck either way. Maybe if all we do is say yes, at some point someone will go \"they're doing everything we say exactly how we say it and it's still not working...why isn't it working?\"\n\nThank you for listening to my rant.

The author explores the transition from using TypeScript/JavaScript to potentially using WebAssembly or C++ for better performance, ultimately sticking with TypeScript for UI and WebGL for rendering due to its efficiency with web platforms. By adopting Pixi.JS for faster WebGL rendering and optimizing code to reduce computation time and resource allocation, significant performance improvements were achieved. Techniques such as object pooling, texture optimization, and code refactoring for efficient memory use were employed. The post highlights challenges and solutions in optimizing game simulation and rendering processes, illustrating the impact of various optimization strategies on game performance.\n\nIf you don't like the summary, just downvote and I'll try to delete the comment eventually üëç\n\nClick here for more info, I read all comments",
