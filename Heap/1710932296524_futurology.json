The rate has probably improved, but as of a few years ago the success rate was like 60-70% in a laboratory environment. Plenty of errors led to cell death, other cells were missed entirely.\n\nWhich is great for a lot of applications, but that's going to be quite bad for a patient unless it's editing a very specific cell type--which is potentially very useful for some types of cancer, but then you circle back to the not-100% success rate...which means the cancer will just come back. Could be good as a less harmful alternative to chemo and radiation, though.\n\nWe're a very long way from being able to use this to treat all sorts of diseases.

Sounds interesting, right? And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it’d be interesting to check that so that you’re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me.",

AI will help humans do their jobs better and be more productive.\n\nAs for the idea of intentional extinction, it’s not a good or fair way to deal with the challenges from AI and machines.

By responding with \"Wow such genius\", -LsDmThC- is essentially ridiculing Serikan (or ChatGPT) for presenting something so self-evident or banal as if it were a profound insight.\n\nThe notion that there could be regions of space-time with different laws of physics or fundamental constants, as proposed by the concept of metastable vacuums, is an unfalsifiable and speculative idea that lacks empirical evidence or scientific rigor.\n\nAt its core, the idea suggests that the laws and constants we observe in our current understanding of the universe may not hold true in all regions of space-time. However, this assertion is based purely on theoretical conjecture rather than any direct observational data or experimental verification.\n\nOur scientific knowledge is inherently limited to the observable universe and the phenomena we can measure and test. To claim that wholly different physical realities could exist beyond our observational capabilities is an extraordinary claim that requires an extraordinary burden of proof, which the metastable vacuum idea does not provide.\n\nFurthermore, the concept seems to stem from a philosophical position that our current understanding of physics is incomplete or flawed, rather than being grounded in concrete scientific findings. While it is true that our models and theories have limitations and may eventually be revised or expanded, simply speculating about radically different realms of existence without empirical backing is a departure from the principles of scientific inquiry.\n\nAdditionally, the idea of metastable vacuums appears to be an ad-hoc hypothesis introduced to explain specific phenomena, such as the rapid expansion of the early universe, rather than being derived from a coherent theoretical framework supported by evidence. Such ad-hoc hypotheses are often viewed as unsatisfactory in the scientific community, as they can be constructed to explain virtually any observation without providing genuine explanatory power or predictive capability.\n\nIn essence, the argument from -LsDmThC-'s perspective is that the idea of metastable vacuums is a highly speculative and unfalsifiable concept that lacks empirical support, scientific rigor, and explanatory power. It is a philosophical musing about the limitations of our knowledge rather than a substantive scientific theory grounded in observable and testable phenomena.\n\nWhile it is important to remain open-minded and consider alternative explanations, entertaining such speculative ideas without any evidential basis or rigorous theoretical framework risks straying into the realm of pseudoscience or unproductive philosophical conjecture, rather than advancing our understanding of the universe through the scientific method",

The notion of a semantic reasoner generalizes that of an inference engine, by providing a richer set of mechanisms to work with. The inference rules are commonly specified by means of an ontology language, and often a description logic language. Many reasoners use first-order predicate logic to perform reasoning; inference commonly proceeds by forward chaining and backward chaining.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language\n\nThe Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a family of knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies. Ontologies are a formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects.\n\nOntologies resemble class hierarchies in object-oriented programming but there are several critical differences. Class hierarchies are meant to represent structures used in source code that evolve fairly slowly (perhaps with monthly revisions) whereas ontologies are meant to represent information on the Internet and are expected to be evolving almost constantly. Similarly, ontologies are typically far more flexible as they are meant to represent information on the Internet coming from all sorts of heterogeneous data sources. Class hierarchies on the other hand tend to be fairly static and rely on far less diverse and more structured sources of data such as corporate databases.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)\n\nRDF represents information using semantic triples, which comprise a subject, predicate, and object. Each item in the triple is expressed as a Web URI. Turtle provides a way to group three URIs to make a triple, and provides ways to abbreviate such information, for example by factoring out common portions of URIs. For example, information about Huckleberry Finn could be expressed as:\n\nhttp://example.org/person/Mark_Twain\n\nhttp://example.org/relation/author\n\nhttp://example.org/books/Huckleberry_Finn .",

        "comment": "I think the reality is much, much more complicated than this.\n\nFirst of all, we should not overstate the current capabilities of AI and automation. Just because LLMs are currently progressing pretty well doesn't mean they're not going to hit a wall at some point in the near future beyond which improvement will be slow until a new method is found to speed it up again. Stuff like that.\n\nSecondly, this misunderstands how the economy actually works. There aren't a set number of jobs in the economy and that's it. The amount of jobs available in an economy can change. If AI takes 15% of the current types of jobs, that doesn't mean a 15% jobless rate. Because AI will likely significantly lower the price of production. Will in return either increase profits or decrease the cost of goods or both. In return there will be more money in circulation that people can spend on other goods and services, including in sectors where there is not as big of a role of AI. In addition, AI needs stuff to run as well. Maintainence, developers, even people at power plants generating the power to run them. More AI usage indirectly means more of these jobs are required too.\n\nThe TLDR here being: AI taking 15% of jobs would almost certainly not mean a 15% unemployment rate, but rather people doing different kinds of jobs than before.\n\nUntil the day that AI can basically do every single job, there is no legitimate fear of massive job loss beyond just a lack of training and retraining in the proper fields. That is a genuine concern but in theory quite solveable.\n\nThirdly, theoretical demand (without directly taking into account money in circulation) is basically infinite, it's supply that's always constrained. More automation means more supply (theoretically) which is basically an unambiguously good thing. Fewer people doing more work means more wealth for the same number of people. The problem comes in only when you have a problem with wealth distribution. Here I do think UBI would be quite helpful, but so would many other policies like a wealth tax, or a breaking apart monopolies, or an AI tax, etc.",

Work - leasure balance will change, we will spend more time on education etc.\n\nAnd the motivation to work will certainly also change. If at the start of the industrial revolution the motivation was simple - work or starve to death. Then today, it's not quite so extreme, you will survive, work or no work, because social guarantees are good enough. It's rather about being able to afford all the nice things. So if you imagine how that will continue to evolve, with more automation we will be able to take for granted more things, but still work for things machines just can't do for us.\n\nAnd if you think of all the people who have plenty and more money, but still continue to work. Or people who do some sort of charitable work. Or who have a hobby that is basically a second job. There are secondary motivations beyond what you can buy with your paycheck.",

They would work the 7th but that is actually illegal with fines attached if your boss demands it. You can't even volunteer for 7s more than very occasionally in many industries.\n\nAutomation hasn't helped the average man, it's only concentrated wealth in a few and made some jobs less physical labor intensive. Automation has so far made enough extra product that the tertiary handling takes more people overall, but largely technology has reduced the skill requirements for workers to produce a consistent product and reduced the real median wage. It's masked because the price of many goods has fallen.\n\nThe one exception is small farm owners, and that's been made nearly unprofitable. I've been doing country people's taxes, and without the government agricultural subsidy, almost every single one would be taking an overall loss. The few in the green have 40 year old tractors their parents paid off and their kids all work on the farm still.\n\nMany farmers growing anything around here take an actual loss and write the home business losses off on their taxes for their primary job at one of the factories. The liability of farming is nuts too. A bit of dry weather and you lose all the beans, thousands in just seed and fertilizer gone to waste, not to mention any farmhands you paid. Most old farm families rent the land to factory farms instead of taking up the liability themselves. I've worked alongside many, many men who go home and harvest all night and show up completely fried for a few weeks during harvest.\n\nCows for eating are about the only stable profit. Milk they mess around and try and lowball you cause you can not sell raw milk(it's illegal), and home pasteurization is too expensive to maintain. Beef you can private sell with processing at any butcher. Eggs you can sell on the country curb honor store.\n\nIf we had a real middle class, we might see new industries or be able to make handmade furniture and toys, but there is not enough wealth in the middle class to fund a general renaissance age or even general entrepreneurship, and they for sure are too busy at their 9-5s to notice anything that isn't directly advertised to them. The old guard will continue to buy regulations preventing new competition, buy the competition that slips through the gaps, and litigate against the ones who refuse to sell out.\n\nMaybe the bitcoin billionaires number more than I expect, but we are in huge trouble.",

As has been noted, plenty of disbelievers had religious parents or grandparents.\n\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#what-explains-the-declining-fertility-rate\n\nit becomes evident that countries with lower child mortality rates tend to have lower fertility rates, regardless of the dominant religion. This suggests that the health of children is a stronger predictor of fertility rates than religious affiliation. ...\n\nThere is evidence that, when everything else is equal, religious people have more children, meaning that religion matters for differences at the same socio-economic level.\n\nStill, the differences between religions within the same country are much smaller than the differences between different countries of the same religion in different socio-economic conditions. We can see how much more living conditions matter than religion.\n\nAnother interesting read:\n\nReligion and Fertility: Will the Religious Really Inherit the Earth?",

Before that point, the natural state of the bulk of humans is to associate happiness with being a part of a community, helping others, and doing your part to keep society running, whether you're making a lot of money or not, whether it's helping an aunt watch kids, filling in where you're needed, etc...\n\nOnce a society has a free market bent, the culture changes so that happiness is self-actualization, conspicuous consumption, being \"independent\" by trading your labor on the market for a high wage, which allows you to buy nice jeans, electronics, and take pictures in front of the Eiffel Tower to show your social media feed.\n\nModern capitalist corporations have used the dopamine drip of the latter lifestyle to rewire our wants and needs to override the natural inclination to form community and family. Every immigrant group that came to America eventually \"Americanizes\", because you have to move for your job, spend overtime in the office or job site, and everyday life just structures itself more around making money than living as in pre-neoliberal life.\n\nSo yes, I would expect that no matter how tough life gets, women in Niger will still try to have children and family. And that dumping money on women in Sweden and Norway may move the needle, but not by much.\n\nBut I'd argue that if you change your policies to go leftwards enough that a culture can shift, and people actually have the economic breathing room to again spend a Saturday with extended family who are laughing, partaking in traditions, with kids running around and music and board games, people will naturally think \"Ah, this is nicer than catching up with work emails on the weekend and networking on LinkedIn for my personal career development. If it's economically viable, I'd like to live like this\".\n\nI feel that the \"Women in Africa have lots of babies, women in Western countries with high safety nets don't. Checkmate.\" argument doesn't take on the nuance of the full incentive scheme we give in society.",

The historical arrangement under capitalism is that a \"successful\" family only needed one income. Family planning allowed for control over family size. So when women couldn't afford to be pregnant, have another child, and then raise one, they controlled that number to a steady zero.\n\nPair all that with the fact that women aren't forced to be mothers if they don't want to. In places withe large and young populations you see poverty and lack of opportunity. That is a double edged sword when many get the chance to have fulfilling careers instead, that aren't speed bumped for every kid.\n\nChinese communism is a massive hypocrisy. Mao and the earliest communists liberated women in the Chinese countryside from being child brides one generation away from foot binding. Liberating women and sharing all labor equally among the sexes. Childcare wasn't just subsidized it was free.\n\nIf the communists stayed true to their goals they wouldn't still have the \"Hukou\" system.

At this time, the price of lithium has returned to where it was before the bubble and production has increased massively with the stabilized price.\n\nFor stationary use applications like grid storage, iron redox flow batteries are easily the winner as their electrolytes, anodes and cathodes can be replaced without recyling the battery and in addition to being non-toxic and non-scarce, they are far cheaper than sodium ion can ever be and work at gigawatt scales effectively with no thermal management problems.\n\nSo the chance of sodium gaining much traction in the next few decades is very unlikely. Lithium transportation batteries will become cheaper and cheaper and iron flow batteries will replace old coal and natural gas installations for stationary power storage and industrial power.",

That's known. And more importantly, you once again failed to cover the \"no choice in the matter issue.\" Is it ethical to force upon others that cannot choose themselves? I don't know.\n\nSo, without having any choice in the matter, beings are forced into consciousness, for no good reason (seriously- ask people why they had kids) with the guarantee that they will experience suffering at some point and no guarantee they will be happy. Even if they are happy, they will eventually suffer.\n\nSo, knowing this, is it ethical to have children or not?\n\nThe real question is \"how good can good be.\" We may in fact reach a state of virtually no suffering, and the only way to get there is through continued efforts on that front. So I would contend that while it may not currently be ethical, eventually it should be and so we should continue on (as opposed to extinction).\n\nBut no matter how you slice it, the answer is non-trivial.",

Most would say it is absurd for even asking this question.\n\nHowever if you think from a ruthless capitalist - i.e your life only has value if you contribute to other people's lives by being productive, then the answer seems like a yes.\n\nSuppose we twist - we never kill but we put those humans in an equivalent happy prison, away from rest of productive society.\n\nWe use pesticides equivalent to lakes wiping a large number of species from planet. Why? Because no value to humans. We wipe forests to make way for our again.\n\nWe value productive citizens and most countries go to lengths to ban immigration. Criminals are housed in prisons away from society.\n\nIf AI can replace billions of workers, those workers have no productive value. In a capitalist society, those workers will live in poverty. Perhaps a less painful avenue is more favorable.\n\nI am sure in a future, an AI will the question but in a different frame - Is it ethical to kill all non-productive humans?

As part of this initiative, NASA seeks to foster a lunar economy in which the space agency is not the sole customer.\n\nAlso from the article\n\nIn recent months, a US Defense organization, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, has stepped in to help. This is important because DARPA is a key supporter of emerging technologies with a track record of success. (DARPA, for example, bought the very first launch on SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket.) Last year, the defense agency announced it was initiating a study, LunA-10, to understand how best to facilitate a thriving lunar economy by 2035.\n\nPlease reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1bihsyy/the_us_government_seems_serious_about_developing/kvk9tl7/",

And we have about 3 billion years before the inner solar system disappears into the sun.\n\nEdit: Correction from Claude 3 Opus\n\nThe other redditor's statement is likely true, assuming that mining operations on the Moon would not significantly increase over time. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\nMass of the Earth: The Earth's mass is approximately 5.972 × 1024 kg (or roughly 6 sextillion tons).\n\nMass of the Moon: The Moon's mass is about 7.342 × 1022 kg (or roughly 81 quintillion tons), which is approximately 1.2% of the Earth's mass.\n\nEstimated total weight of mined materials: As mentioned in the previous answer, estimates suggest that the total weight of all materials mined from the Earth throughout human history could be in the range of several trillion tons. For this example, let's use a high estimate of 10 trillion tons.\n\nAnnual mining from the Moon: If we were to mine the equivalent of 10 trillion tons from the Moon every year and bring it back to Earth, it would take 8.1 million years to mine a mass equivalent to 1% of the Moon's total mass (81 quintillion tons ÷ 10 trillion tons per year = 8.1 million years).\n\nImpact over 3 billion years: Over a period of 3 billion years, the total mass mined from the Moon and brought to Earth would be approximately 30 quintillion tons (10 trillion tons per year × 3 billion years). This is about 0.5% of the Earth's total mass and about 37% of the Moon's mass.\n\nWhile 37% of the Moon's mass is significant, it is not likely to have a substantial impact on the Moon's overall structure or orbit, especially if the mining is done gradually over billions of years. The added mass to the Earth would also be relatively small compared to its total mass.\n\nHowever, this is a simplified calculation and does not take into account factors such as the feasibility of mining at such a scale, the energy required for transportation, or the potential environmental impacts on both the Moon and the Earth.",

How so?\n\nThere's a lot of Helium-3 on the lunar surface.\n\nHelium-3 is an isotope used for nuclear fusion and while extremely scarce on Earth, it is plentiful on the Moon, created by the solar wind emitted from the Sun. 2 days ago\n\nHelium-3 Fusion cycle\n\nNow for a bit of speculation. With the current approach to Fusion energy, helium-3 isn't the \"fuel of choice\". I think this is because using the current approach (brute force pressure and temperature) requires too much energy input.\n\nBut let's say you had a helium-3 rich plasma. The main factor determining the threshold for fusion is the Coulomb force that causes the + charged He-3 nuclei from getting close enough to fuse to each other.\n\nIf there was a way to increase the concentration of negative charge, you would see an increase in the concentration of +'ive nuclei via charge cancellation.\n\nYou might be able to increase the concentration of -'ve charge by using an electron beam.\n\nHere's a diagram showing how it might work.\n\nInstead of a vaccum chamber with \"base material\" you'd have a plasma chamber that was full of positively charged He-3 nuclei. The introduction of the electron beam draws the He-3 nuclei closer together (via charge cancellation).\n\nInstead of expending large amounts of energy on higher temps, higher pressures, magnetic confinement etc. you'd be expending (probably) a much smaller amount of energy on your electron beam.\n\nThe strength of the beam (ie. concentration of electrons and rate of electron \"delivery\" into the He-3 plasma) would determine the rate of the fusion reaction... if the process works.\n\nOnce your reactor is up and running, some of the power generated by the fusion reaction would go to running the electron beam.\n\nYou could control (or tune) the reaction rate by controlling the strength of the beam.\n\nIf you really wanted to take this idea further?\n\nYou could use star types as a way of categorizing power levels. How so?\n\nRed (or Red Dwarf) would represent a low reaction rate. Quite possibly the one with the highest efficiency level.\n\nOrange, yellow etc. up to blue would then represent higher and more energetic reaction rates. Perhaps less efficient as well.\n\ntldr; If He-3 Fusion is possible (and we know there's lots of it on the Moon) this might explain the recent interest in going back and \"setting up shop\".",

I have worries about what will happen to the working class when those who already have the majority of resources start racing for more among the stars. I understand that there is a good chance that those resources will benefit everyone, but it won't make our problems here go away.\n\nAlso there is the defacing of a natural wonder that is culturally significant to everyone going back to the beginning of our species. I'd rather we use the moon as a orbital platform to mine asteroids than to mine the moon directly.",
