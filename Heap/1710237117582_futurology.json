Merton. The theory states that society puts pressure on individuals to achieve socially accepted goals (such as the American Dream), even though they lack the means to do so. This leads to strain, which may lead individuals to commit crimes, like selling drugs or becoming involved in prostitution as a means to gain financial security.\n\n&\n\n2️⃣The four Mertonian norms (often abbreviated as the CUDO-norms):\n\ncommunism: all scientists should have common ownership of scientific goods (intellectual property), to promote collective collaboration; secrecy is the opposite of this norm.\n\nuniversalism: scientific validity is independent of the sociopolitical status/personal attributes of its participants.\n\ndisinterestedness: scientific institutions act for the benefit of a common scientific enterprise, rather than for the personal gain of individuals within them.\n\norganized skepticism: scientific claims should be exposed to critical scrutiny before being accepted: both in methodology and institutional codes of conduct.\n\npoint being, the question of \"what happened\" has been asked many times over the years, a recent example is this opinion piece in the atlantic which offers a few different answers (that are all mostly valid) but the simplest answer is there has been a coordinated effort from wealthy groups to propagandize each and every one of us into believing in the lies of \"trickle down economics\" and that the \"free market\" can do no wrong - while simultaneously infiltrating legal and political offices at every level of society\n\n& unfortunately it worked, for a really long time, without much resistance",

Talk about an understatement. Obese people can drop more than 15% of their body weight, studies have found, and two of the medications are now approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for weight reduction. A surge in demand for the drugs as slimming treatments has led to shortages. “This class of drugs is exploding in popularity,” says clinical psychologist Joseph Schacht of the University of Colorado School of Medicine.\n\nBut patient reports and animal studies have yielded tantalizing signs that the drugs may spur another unexpected and welcome effect: fighting addiction. Most early trials were disappointing, but they used less potent versions of the drugs. Now, at least nine phase 2 clinical trials are underway or being planned to test whether the more powerful compound semaglutide and its chemical cousins can help patients curb their use of cigarettes, alcohol, opioids, or cocaine. Hopes are high. Semaglutide (sold under the trade names Wegovy, Ozempic, and Rybelsus) “is truly the most exciting drug for the last few decades,” says neuropharmacologist Leandro Vendruscolo of the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nIf the results of the new trials are positive, addiction science could have its own “Prozac moment,” says clinical neuroscientist W. Kyle Simmons of the Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences. In the 1980s, that drug brought a sea change to psychiatry, becoming part of popular culture and leading to the wider use of antidepressants.\n\nAdditional research: The role of glucagon‐like peptide 1 (GLP‐1) in addictive disorders\n\nCould Semaglutide Treat Addiction as Well as Obesity?",

(that said, don't try this at home - the medication and monitoring is necessary. You could fucking die, or fry half your brain otherwise).\n\nBut there are two other components to the addiction: behavioral, and psychological. There's no pill for those - except to help with underlying causes such as anxiety. It takes a whole year of full sobriety, lifestyle changes and therapy to get rid of those two. After that one year, some people may resume a \"normal\" - as in controlled - intake of alcohol, while others will remain vulnerable for life and won't ever be able to take a single drink without relapsing.\n\nRewiring the brain to get rid of those forms of addiction would be in the far future, indeed. If we could do that, we could probably do anything else with the brain - change sexual orientation, learn to like brussel sprouts, feel a compulsion for doing 30mn of sport everyday ; or more likely, deeply enjoy working 16h a day in a cubicle and loving unconditionally the god-king.",

            "comment": "Additional context (from the article): To create a cheaper and faster way to test for PFAS, the MIT team designed a sensor based on lateral flow technology — the same approach used for rapid Covid-19 tests and pregnancy tests. Instead of a test strip coated with antibodies, the new sensor is embedded with a special polymer known as polyaniline, which can switch between semiconducting and conducting states when protons are added to the material.\n\nThe researchers deposited these polymers onto a strip of nitrocellulose paper and coated them with a surfactant that can pull fluorocarbons such as PFAS out of a drop of water placed on the strip. When this happens, protons from the PFAS are drawn into the polyaniline and turn it into a conductor, reducing the electrical resistance of the material. This change in resistance, which can be measured precisely using electrodes and sent to an external device such as a smartphone, gives a quantitative measurement of how much PFAS is present.\n\nThis approach works only with PFAS that are acidic, which includes two of the most harmful PFAS — PFOA and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA).\n\nThe current version of the sensor can detect concentrations as low as 200 parts per trillion for PFBA, and 400 parts per trillion for PFOA. This is not quite low enough to meet the current EPA guidelines, but the sensor uses only a fraction of a milliliter of water. The researchers are now working on a larger-scale device that would be able to filter about a liter of water through a membrane made of polyaniline, and they believe this approach should increase the sensitivity by more than a hundredfold, with the goal of meeting the very low EPA advisory levels.\n\n“We do envision a user-friendly, household system,” Swager says. “You can imagine putting in a liter of water, letting it go through the membrane, and you have a device that measures the change in resistance of the membrane.”\n\nSuch a device could offer a less expensive, rapid alternative to current PFAS detection methods. If PFAS are detected in drinking water, there are commercially available filters that can be used on household drinking water to reduce those levels. The new testing approach could also be useful for factories that manufacture products with PFAS chemicals, so they could test whether the water used in their manufacturing process is safe to release into the environment.",

The regime punished humorists they felt were anti-government, but they tolerated complaining humor that didn't suggest real opposition. \"Whispered jokes\" were popular amongst the public, who caught onto which things were and weren't safe to say - but these weren't widely published until after the war.\n\nThe regime curtailed its negative satire when the public got tired of hearing it (as measured by magazine sales declining). Another type of comedy called \"German humor\" arose that was more benign and avoided political subjects - I get the impression that it was kind of like lighthearted sitcoms about hapless characters facing everyday problems, without reminding the audience of the exclusion of minorities. Apparently the whole anti-Jewish thing wasn't super popular with the public. I can't tell if they were uncomfortable with it or just got tired of hearing about it. But you have to remember most Germans had no clue about the extermination program.",

That allows people to plan long-term.\n\nPut these three together, and what you get is that UBI generally results in more future-facing uses of money. In other words - people tend to use UBI in ways that make them more productive. Add to that factors such as better access to healthcare at earlier stages, or to less affordable but much more durable commodities, and you also end up saving money. In other words, people are able to afford to spend smart.\n\nSo, basically, the cost of UBI is smaller than calculated, by whatever it would replace. Then, the government essentially gets cashback, in the form of smarter spending and increased productivity. If you don't end up spending less overall, the expenditure hike is much less than one would expect.\n\nAfter all, in most developed countries, the main financial asset of the country is the populace. A healthy, skilled populace that's not forced to make bad choices is an excellent financial asset that will produce a lot of wealth. That's straightforward enough!",

That is why you break up monopolies and oligopolies, so that companies have to compete with each other and drive down their prices.\n\nIt's true that increasing minimum wage forces companies that have to pay those wages to increase the price of the goods or services they provide in order to cover the costs. That or eat into their profit margins. If there is healthy competition, and profit margins are large, a company will think twice before raising prices on their products, for fear of losing out on market share.\n\nIn any case, most proponents of UBI propose that it be funded not just through taxes leveled at companies, but at high-value individuals, and/or land value tax.\n\nThere's just no evidence of the idea that when UBI is implemented, companies raise prices.

The problems are frequently supply-side - too few healthcare workers, too little lumber getting through our border, too few houses being built, too many regulations and neighborhood associations preventing housing people built, affordability issues that exacerbate labor availability (e.g. tourist towns where you cannot rent due to everything being an Airbnb, thus making workers drive 30 miles), there's a whole slew of problems.\n\nUnfortunately, UBI would not really help because it would/should\n\nremove excess labor from the system, which currently has an extremely tight labor market. tight labor markets are GOOD for workers because they increase the price of labor i.e. wages. UBI exists to solve the \"too many workers\" problem, not too few.\nUSA's economic problems are supply side not demand side - there's tons of demand for cars, homes, food, travel, and a host of other discretionary spending. Time and time again, we've seen that increases in costs of these items do not cause a loss of net profit - people are willing to pay more!\nAs such, injecting free money into any system will simply increase the price of goods/services since demand for goods will go up by definition - free money might raise worker wages, but it will also increase demand for basically everything, as it's now no longer a choice (for example) whether to have flank steak or ribeye for dinner. If money were no object, I'd pick dry-aged, fine-ass ribeye every time.\nI'm not sure if anyone's been following the Oregon drug-decriminalization saga, but recently citizens have turned against the can tax (which gives a $0.05 rebate per can submitted at recycling centers) after (not-so-scientific) experiments have shown that shutting down collection centers encourages public drug users to go elsewhere. I know UBI might not be the same as getting a grand mailed to your house each month, but if it can happen with cans, it can probably happen with UBI. From what I've seen, the average liberal is not happy with free money being used to buy drugs, and this whole thing is rapidly gaining steam. Note that I don't really have an opinion here - this is just a synopsis from a small, crazy city that tried to both legalize drugs and has a \"free money cheat code\" for those willing to harvest cans out of your bins.",

Under the Yang plan, she could get a UBI of $1000/month. In order to do that, she gives up the $600 in benefits she already receives. Thus, in the end she's getting an additional $400. Which, in isolation, is a good deal for her.\n\nHowever, Joe who lives across the street gets $1000/month. So Joe gets an additional $1000 but Single Mom gets an additional $400. Personally, I think that's not fair. If anything, Single Mom should get the $1000 in addition to her SNAP benefits. I also think that Single Mom should get an additional payment for her 2 kids, which she would not get under the Yang plan.\n\nThe thing is, his plan is funded with the assumption that only adults get the UBI AND basically an elimination of the social safety net (as well as an implemented VAT tax). His funding falls apart if we include the entire population and maintain the existing social safety net.",

Some of them will blow their monthly UBI check on crack, and then what are we supposed to do... Let them die in the streets because we no longer fund a SNAP and replaced Federal funds to hospitals with an extra $300/month? No, obviously not.

It seems like benefits to individuals are obvious when you run small tests because they’re suddenly receiving more money even though the macroeconomic environment they’re living in is unchanged, but once it’s universalized I have no idea how it wouldn’t just get eaten up by inflation since everyone is competing for the same goods but with more dollars.\n\nIdk, it’s something I’d like to be able to get moved on. It’s possible that it could improve quality of life for the people at the very bottom of the economic ladder even if everyone else is a bit worse off which might be fine or more fair. If I’m remembering correctly, the only way Yang could get the math to work was by cutting other forms of federal aid and increasing taxes.\n\nIf you took the entire revenue of the Federal Gov’t from last year ($4.439T) and divided it by 330M you get $13,451 per person. So assuming we’re going with the $1,000 a month model we’re looking at pretty significant tax increases, a likelihood of rent/COL spikes, and fewer other social safety nets in exchange for the equivalent of every full-time worker getting a $6.25/hr raise.",

A hypothesis that says as technology advances less jobs will be available. This has a ripple effect because jobs is just another way of saying income.\n\nIncome is increasingly needed in modern society as the thought of retirement which was once a reachable goal for many citizens of many nations are now unreachable. This is under the pretense that the money you have today will be worth less than the money you have in the future thus saving for retirement is increasingly impossible as time goes on.\n\nAny planners would see this problem immediately and UBI seems to be the most obvious solution to the income problem. Another way of saying if people no longer have the means to have access to food due to the increases in price or pay rent or housing for the same reasons then unrest and uncertainty is the likely outcome or worse.\n\nUBI if used as a solution must be in place before the problem overtakes the majority of the poor to middle class not because that's the right thing to do but because that's where the majority of the population lays. And if they were to be hit with no means of providing a living for themselves as a general group then the outcome will be very scary.\n\nIf you look at the trends of your local environment then you could see how far along the path and the increasing necessity for the solution of \"income\" is in whatever form that takes. Most commonly pointed out to in the form of a UBI.\n\nWhy can we not take UBI seriously? I guess that depends on who is under the \"we\" category of your statement.",

From the perspective of those paying for it, it just sounds like someone asking for free money.\n\nAnd, here's the problem, the desire for free money is a hole that can never be filled. If society gives a UBI of $100 this month, then next month everyone will be asking for $200. ad infinitum. And once that spigot gets turned on it'll never be shut off again.\n\nBut from the perspective of those that receive it, there's a basic dignity aspect that needs to be addressed. It's painful to see a good person who works hard unable to afford basic necessities.\n\nIf I were god-emperor my version of UBI would be in the form of a social dividend. And payed for by taxing automation. When that pool of money runs out, then that's the size of the dividend. If we want a bigger dividend, then the economy needs to grow.\n\nUsing a dividend model would change the way governments pay for things. And, it would change how people react to their governments. When the TSA was created, no one talked about cost. It was only about perceived benefits and then it became: 'this needs to be done so shut up.\"\n\nUnder a social dividend version, the TSA would have been presented as reducing everyone's UBI by 20%. Which would have faced enormous pushback and we all would have collectively been okay with just locking the cockpit doors. I also doubt the US would be involved in too many external conflicts.\n\ntl;dr: make UBI a benefit to those paying for it and it will happen.",

If we attempted it in the US, controlling only for working adults making less than 100k and only getting $1000/month, we'd STILL be talking a cost of nearly $4 trillion a year. The US annual budget is only a little over $6 trillion, so UBI alone even in its most conservative and stingy form costs as much as 2/3 of the US budget.\n\nWhere would that money even come from? Most likely, government would cut a whole bunch of other safety net programs which help people a whole lot more than UBI would. They'd also cut a lot of agency spending that helps ensure we have clean water and food, fire services, safety in basic products even like shampoo, etc. We'd probably lose the ACA too, and we'd never have any hope of seeing universal healthcare or a single-payer system. We'd lose a lot more from UBI than we'd gain, and even then, it wouldn't be enough to pay for the program.\n\nFurthermore, if, as this sub often likes to discuss, we move to UBI in a post-work world, where's the tax revenue for the government to spend on UBI even coming from? No work, no salaries, no tax revenue. If people aren't making money, there won't be any money to use on UBI. UBI is a self-defeating policy. Issue with UBI is it's overly simplistic, whereas a true solution to the issues we face is going to be extremely complex. People like UBI because it sounds good and it's easy to understand the concept of, whereas most real policy makes people's heads spin. But it's a bad policy, and overall just a bad idea.",

This could help ensure that the experts are both highly qualified and broadly acceptable to the public. We can also implement mechanisms for regular review and the possibility of recall or re-confirmation could help maintain accountability.\n\nBut of course it doesn't completely resolve the issues you've highlighted, such as ensuring that the system remains dynamic and responsive without becoming bogged down. The balance of power and influence between these experts and the general public is another one, especially in contentious areas where expert consensus may not align with popular opinion.\n\nIt does introduce a new set of challenges that require consideration and innovative solutions.",

Keep in mind in most places you can select parties whos voting priority centers around a field of issues (like climate change or immigration).\n\nThanks, will look into it!\n\nAnd you've got a point about the meritocracy aspect. There's definitely a ton of brainpower behind the scenes. Maybe it's not so much about the absence of smart decision-making but more about how those decisions are communicated and perceived. Like, if decisions are made based on solid expertise but it doesn't feel that way to the public, there's a disconnect somewhere, right?\n\nThe strawman argument about lack of knowledge or merit in governance is an interesting angle. It's kind of a catch-22: you want decisions to be informed and effective, but the more you lean into expertise, the harder it might be for the average Joe to get on board or even understand what's going on. It highlights a real tension between expertise and accessibility.\n\nBalancing that, making complex issues digestible without dumbing them down or losing the nuance, is definitely a tough nut to crack. Maybe part of the solution is in finding better ways to bridge that gap, making the process more transparent and inclusive without sacrificing the depth of expertise that goes into it. What's your take on making this interchange less of a hurdle and more of a smooth road?",

Also, coming from a city notorious for doing just this, you end up getting a voter’s pamphlet and ballot the size of a telephone book. This does not drive voter engagement, it drives them away in droves. But yes, vote for issues, not personalities. In other words vote for the person who largely backs sensible public policies, and isn’t just in it for the fame and money. Good luck on that.",

For example, I live in a large metro area and I am no expert in agriculture. However, there are people who specialize in this. I suppose, that their voice would be more important on agricultural issues than my, yet me and a neighbor like me can easily outvote their idea.\n\nthere would still be a need for some department to decide on the options we can choose from. That is de facto like transfer of all the powers into hands of that institution, as they can only propose biased options. I think it would also be a system highly susceptible to disinformation or some kind of information cacaphony in which every vote = a different opinion.

            "comment": "First off, the point about politicians changing their stances is super valid. It's like trying to keep track of a chameleon in a disco—tough work. But, isn't that exactly why we need a system that demands transparency and accountability? Imagine a platform that not only lists these issues but also tracks politicians' stances in real-time. Every flip-flop, every nuanced shift could be logged, providing us with a more dynamic, honest picture of where they truly stand. Sure, it sounds like a Herculean task, but with today's tech, we're closer than ever to making it feasible. The real question is, are we ready to demand that level of openness?\n\nNow, onto the juicy bit about voting on issues. You're bang on saying many of us are far more independent than the 2 party system, but many folks also feel boxed in by the two-party system. It's like being asked to choose between vanilla and chocolate when what you really want is mint choc chip. But here's where I'm gonna nudge back a bit—wouldn't a focus on issues over personalities help highlight those hidden, common grounds we share? It's not about every vote leading to a kumbaya moment, but rather uncovering the nuanced, complex web of opinions that exist beyond the binary party lines.\n\nYes, the potential for a fragmented outcome is real, but that's where the design of such a system needs to be clever. What if, instead of diluting the vote, this approach forced politicians to form coalitions based on shared priorities on specific issues? We're talking about a more fluid, responsive form of governance, where alliances are built around solving problems, not just towing the party line.\n\nOf course, the devil's in the details. How do you ensure these issues are fairly chosen and not just the loudest voices in the room? It's a legit concern. This is where your idea of independent verification comes in clutch. Picture a mix of crowd-sourced voting to identify top issues, tempered by expert analysis to ensure we're not just chasing after windmills. It's a balance of wisdom of the crowd with the insight of the sage, aiming to keep the ship steady.\n\nSo, while the hurdles are non-trivial, they're not insurmountable. It's about building something resilient, adaptable, and transparent, capable of evolving as our needs and technologies do. What do you reckon? Could this blend of optimism and pragmatism pave a way forward, or are there angles we're still missing?",

Even scientists don't value the same thing in their own field. Politics is all moral questions. \n\nThis thought experiment challenges the traditional electoral cycle, proposing a more dynamic and responsive approach that aims to directly tackle misinformation, voter disillusionment, and governance inefficiency.\n\nYet, this raises several questions:\n\nHow do we ensure the impartiality of experts?\n\nCan we effectively balance economic efficiency with societal values?\n\nWhat mechanisms can protect the system's integrity against manipulation?\n\nIf you have on impartial expert you'll never get ride of misinformation from distrustful people. \nThat's an absolutely massive question that's never solved in a democracy. It depends who has the power and the values of society.

This phenomenon, where larger mammals like whales and elephants display a remarkable resistance to cancer, is known as Peto's paradox.\n\nThe paradox highlights a critical area of research in understanding how these animals' genetic makeup contributes to their natural defenses against cancer, potentially offering groundbreaking insights for human cancer treatments.\n\nSimilarly, the exceptional longevity of certain small animals, such as the tiny bats, compared to other small mammals like mice, underlines the diversity in aging mechanisms across species.\n\nBy examining these differences, scientists aim to uncover the underlying genetic factors that influence lifespan and resistance to age-related diseases.\n\nMoreover, the study of naked mole rats, which are virtually cancer-proof, opens another exciting avenue for biomedical research.\n\nThese creatures possess unique mechanisms that prevent cancer cells from proliferating, which could be replicated or adapted in human medicine to develop novel cancer therapies.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role in this exploration by analyzing vast amounts of genetic data from these animals, identifying patterns and genetic markers linked to disease resistance, longevity, and other desirable traits.\n\nThe integration of AI accelerates the pace of discovery, making it possible to synthesize and test hypotheses at an unprecedented rate.\n\nAs we continue to explore the genetic treasures hidden within the animal kingdom, the collaboration between geneticists, biologists, and AI specialists will likely lead to revolutionary advancements in healthcare, extending human healthspan and enhancing our quality of life.\n\nThese insights not only promise to tackle some of the most pressing health challenges of our time but also underscore the interconnectedness of all life on Earth, guiding us toward a more sustainable and harmonious coexistence with nature.:.",

This can take years if not decades. This goes for senolytics and whatever else as well, but so far this stuff is only proven in model organisms.

We can't even fix a handful ammount of genes, only one or at most a couple of them, and those treatment costs millions of bucks. In that case, we would need to fix thousands of genes, and I can't see how that can happen.\n\nYou are conflating two very different things.\n\nIn the latter case, you are talking about gene therapies that change genes. Replacing something that is in the body's existing DNA blueprint with something that is not in the body's existing DNA blueprint. For each thing you want to do, you need to figure out the new DNA blue print, and exactly which segment of existing DNA to replace, and how to replace only that. In short, it needs to be a customized therapy for each case.\n\nFor aging, we're talking about repairing genes. The information is already present in the body's DNA blueprint, you \"just\" need to fix transcription errors. That's not something that needs to be done separately for each segment or pattern of DNA. You need to create a single error-fixing mechanism, and it should work for all of those cases.\n\nAt most we can extend our lifespan by 10-30% in the far far future, well after gen Alpha have been passed away.\n\nThere's no \"far future\" for that number; that's just the present.

I wouldn't say it's unrealistic,  it's more so beyond the scope of current technology and research.  It might change in the future but for the next 20-40 years we need far better understanding of the human body and the brain before we can even hypothesize ideas for longevity.  \n\nWe do know that most things that would give us longevity also greatly increase cancer risks. So we might learn that longevity causes too many risks to be viable. Or maybe the risks are low but we end up living for an extra 50 years before cancer finally does us in. \n\nWe do know some animals live to 200 and some very simple animals live longer.\n\nIt's one of those \"content\" drivers for futurism. It drives clicks and views but research is very thin and overhyped.

We will have bad quality posts on here for a long time until the next big thing takes over. \n\nAI is much the same in that it's not well understood by laymen and the majority of people providing information on it are corporate representatives or involved in a product that they back.

Some of these drugs may be useful for profilaxis.\n\nWith all these methods on deck along side better biomarkers to support early preventative intervention (eg in your 30s to 50s), it's possible that people can stay youthful decades longer than today.\n\nThe hardest problem will probably be molecular aging long living essential cells. Neurons in the brain as you point out are particularly difficult.  However, the brain does reconfigure itself and regenerate to some extent, so who knows what the future might bring.",

The services are at various stages of progress, but they all share the same goal—to deploy drones the size of all-terrain vehicles, whose mission is to make the lowly infantry person’s load just a little bit lighter. Despite good intentions, the future of warfare makes it likely that the vehicles (even if adopted) will likely just maintain the heavy status quo.\n\nPlease reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1bc1uca/the_army_and_marines_are_both_pursuing_robomules/kucvg2x/",

Replacing those batteries will suck. Recharging them will not be easy.\nThey will break down\nThey are super easy targets\nThey will make more noise moving, even if completely silent, than a squad on patrol\nClearly none have seen Hohenfels Germany mud that even M1s get stuck in.\n\nHOWEVER, there could be some great uses for them. Larger flying drones could come in and carry wounded to a hospital far easier than a blackhawk could. They could also use those same drones to bring in supplies/ammo. These would be loud, sure, but they could literally fly 1' off the ground at 50+ mph and make a big impact.\n\nThe ground ones could be kind of like a mini-staging area, hanging 1km or so behind the troops, carrying food and extra ammo, and just not following them directly into combat. However, a toyota pickup could probably do the same thing for much cheaper with a much better range and speed.\n\nSo there are some good possible uses for drones in the army, plus any non-combat type roles I didn't think of, but patrolling with a squad is kind of ridiculous in anything but maybe urban operations (but even then are an RPG/Grenade magnet).",

Obviously that is easier said than done since you have to combine the calculation results and different processor units have different specificity i.e. one uses decimals but the other doesn't.

It shows with numbers something we kind of already know, there are huge advantages to \"integrated graphics\".\n\nYou might think that sounds odd, \"integrated graphics sucks right?\". Problem is that people are exposed to low end graphics when it comes to integrated graphics, standalone gpus gives you the option of an extra heatsink and using more space. Its less efficient, but you can easily and cheaply add more power. It is however limited by what typically is the biggest limitation to software, \"read/write between devices\". The article is pointing to that we have the technology to make better cpu-gpu-in-one units, and utilizing these is a good idea. Youll probably see improvements in datacenters first, I think cooling will still be an issue for domestic products.",

Even on-die GPU don't share data directly. The processors have their cache, L1-3 I think, or do we have L4 by now. Some is per core, some is per CCD or whatever Intel calls it. An IGPU uses the system RAM (not CPU cache), but a dedicated GPU can access it as fast as the CPU with DMA. They usually have their own, graphics optimized RAM, but thats one thing that makes them better than IGPUs, GDDR is better than conventional DDR for their specific application. Your Idea would probably require a whole new processor architecture (not x86-64) with something like a shared L3 or L4 cache. That would require a complete redesign of Soft- and Hardware. Plus, cache is usually extremely small (compared to RAM) and not usable for GPU applications. Making it bigger would immensely increase the complexity of the CPU and probably more than eat up any benefits.",
