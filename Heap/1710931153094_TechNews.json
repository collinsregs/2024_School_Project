If it's like the US where everything is terrorism or extremism or kiddy porn related then basically they'll only be unable to use it for traffic tickets... unless it's 'serious' traffic like where they need money.

So this is why it’s nearly impossible to say “does AI help?” Because you need a VERY specific and measurable question to ask. When you think about how many (literal millions? billions?) of clinical scenarios that can be asked of a radiologist everyday, you can see how daunting of a project it is.\n\nI can tell you from experience that I just finished residency, and through my 5 years, I saw some very small steps taken. Nothing that caused me to say, oh wow, that’s scary or impressive.",

A normal structure? Actual pathology? This is the problem. Maybe there was nothing there, but the AI tool thought so. Then the radiologist sees the AI flag something and thinks hmm, I can’t disagree with it because if it’s right and I’m wrong and I blow it off-I could get sued? So I’ll just say it could be something and if the biopsy is negative (like it was here) then everything is fine. But is it fine? Is it okay that it cost you anxiety, money, time for nothing?",
