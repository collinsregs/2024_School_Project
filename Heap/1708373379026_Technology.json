Other coworkers and I share the same concerns which are aligning with other employees from other companies within my industry - media.\n\nYes, the layoffs are in response to the pandemic-era over hiring. But, also, the mismanagement from the executive leadership levels.\n\nThe layoffs are a failed result because managers aren‚Äôt listened to when they stress to their directors the overview of their departments.\n\nCompanies hired thousands of employees during the pandemic to help handle the heavy workload. But mixed into that hiring season, executives approved head counts without first determining their business true need for additional employees in the workflow.\n\nNow, teams are handling more work because the employees that were once staffed are now gone. Companies paid out way too much revenue for more workers. Now, they need to save money.\n\nSpecifically for my company, executive leadership should have first restructured their departments. Yes, it would suck. But instead of laying off employees during the pandemic, you restructured teams to balance the work left by employees that resigned/quit. Then, you identify which areas need help. Then, you hire to fill in those gaps.\n\nWhat my company did? Over hire. Restructured. Then, laid off in massive amounts.\n\nThe end result today: teams have more work and not enough help. Employee moods are stressed. Our departments will not approve additional head counts.\n\nNow, where do we go from here?",

There‚Äôs also a current effort in place by the current administration to more than triple charging stations in the country.\n\nWhy not enact an initial deadline, say 2030/35, where no new ICE vehicles can be sold unless they are hybrids, then enact a second and later deadline where no new ICE vehicles can be sold at all.\n\nPublic perception of EVs is in the toilet despite very rapid advances in vehicle price, charging tech/infrastructure, and battery capacity. Oil companies are extremely good at what they do. Most people with a negative view of EVs usually aren‚Äôt fully informed of the capabilities and resources available. Lots of people have range anxiety even though the current capabilities are more than sufficient if you don‚Äôt commute 100 miles or more on a daily basis.

I think if it wants to do something, it's likely to plan out how and not give any reason for anyone to suspect it. (But again, I really don't think AI will have anything close to human motivations.

Cause if tech advances to the point where we can create such a Von Neumann machine, it only takes one person being malicious (or even just negligent) to completely end the planet. If there are intelligent aliens out there somewhere, and they are significantly more advanced, then how come one asshole didn't ruin it for everyone and create a grey goo scenario?",

If the governments regulate this then it just limits this activity to people outside those areas using tech that was either developed in countries which allow it or tech which was meant for another purpose.\n\nEtherium miners used to use whole rooms full of GPUs, for example. These would be pretty good at LLM training.\n\nFor me it's a question of 'do you want to be involved and have some visibility or do you want this to go on where you can't see it'.",

Maybe he is in the closet and scared to come out as AI after all this time. If he is an AI it would mean you could have a normal relationship. It would also explain the picosecond reflexes necessary to beat you at a video game.\n\nThat is still no excuse to beat you though and just makes him a liar. Call the cops and post updates OP.\n\nNTA",

I'd guess that the vast majority of reports are little more than user trolling, which in turn makes it a tool to make users feel worse. It's clear that reddit does not care if the thing is abused, and the first few times I got the message, I tried reporting it to see if anything would be done. The response I eventually got was that the use wasn't in violation of their policies, so nothing would be done.\n\nSo yeah, good fucking job reddit. And to the people reading this who send these messages thinking it's a joke: fuck you too. It's damaging, not funny. Suicide is a serious issue, not a toy for your amusement. Grow up.",

To do this we only scraped web pages which have been curated/filtered by humans. Manually filtering a full web scrape would be exceptionally expensive so as a starting point, we scraped all outbound links from Reddit, a social media platform, which received at least 3 karma. This can be thought of as a heuristic indicator for whether other users found the link interesting, educational, or just funny\"\n\nhttps://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf\n\nI still despise how popular chatGPT got, because OpenAI used to actually publish their damn research.

Here in America it's called penny slots and most gas stations in Nevada have them. I can walk in and loose a quarter any time I want. It's well known in America that if you want a lot of gamblers, you make the cost of entry low and increase the ROI of the machine to compensate. Eventually people get a few drinks in them and go to the machines that accept bills, and then start putting in bigger bills.\n\nI take it the author (assuming it's even a human that wrote this) has never flown into McCarran. There's penny slots as soon as you step off the plane at the gate. Great way to get a hot 5 win streak and win an entire nickel.\n\nAnd vice versa, for table games all the cards, chips and dice are marked and tracked with the cameras much like how banks track cash money now. Casinos were the first to adopt this long before real banks, because they could just reprint all their currency to make it viewable under the tables' cameras.

Households earning more than $180,000 would pay $92 a month.\n\nThis is on top of some of the highest per-kWh rates in the nation - $0.53/kWh peak rate.\n\nBecause when you're a monopoly, they just let you do it.

When we use the term ‚Äúfree market‚Äù we imagine it as if the market is operating completely free from intervention or guidance from the government, and without investment from public sources. But that is almost never the case. There have been heavy public investments into the advancement of solar technology. This has happened under many of the past administrations. If it weren‚Äôt for the investments from public institutions many technologies wouldn‚Äôt make it out the door nearly as quickly into the free market. Some of these technologies wouldn‚Äôt exist at all because early research can take decades without any possibility of profit. This is why public funding of new technologies is so important. It could take quite a while before the technology is actually worth selling on the free market. But when it does get there, into the free market, and it‚Äôs marketable, then the economies of scale can come into place democratizing the technology.\n\nNow, after all the public funding and public programs over decades, and another decade or two of time in the free market, solar is simply cheaper. And so the market will do its thing.\n\nI personally think it‚Äôs important that people understand what role the market plays in a large and complex society, so that the next solar billionaire that gets created out of the solar boom has trouble explaining how it was the free market that made him rich, not any of the public funding, research and infrastructure that made any of it possible in the first place.",

Where you can just do whatever and it is fine.\nOpen up a new store near a competitor and sell below production cost to drive others bancrupt to then jack up the prices. Make agreements with other producers to increase prices 2% every month untill it starts to affect income, use part of this income to prevent others from entering this market.\nSelling hardware that can only work with your software/refil ink or you make sure it breaks. Making agreements with suposed cometitors not to buy from certain companies.\nDividing up teritories, for example instead of competing soda brand 1 buys up all soda fountains/vending machines on the west coast from soda brand 2 and sells their east coast places to them.\nThen there is no longer cometition and they are free to set whatever price they want. This is what certain internet services are accused of in the US.\nAll these things clearly undermine the free trade of goods and services, the one thing that is suposed to make a free market self regulating.\n\nDeveloping technology doesn't really interfere with a free market as long as the patents are publicly available.

Most of the time you need very little or none of it, and all of the sudden, country is 25% short in its power needs (even more during the night). The only way to make it work is to pay for extra power plants even if they do nothing most of the time.\n\nSo yes solar is cheap, but once you add all the infrastructure to make it vaible on large scales, it start to add up.

Could even be a former industrial site. A group of people made crazy profits buying a large piece of mildly contaminated industrial land that could never be used for construction. Put panels there and had it hooked it to existing power lines that were there. With minimal investment they opened up a large solar farm on land nobody wanted anything to do with.\n\nGrid stability is an issue but isn‚Äôt as big of a deal with solar as long as you have the systems set up to do spot pricing (and I am pretty sure the US has this) during peak production energy prices drop or even go negative. This incentivizes power hungry industry to work when electricity is cheaper or free and this lets solar farms shut off when the grid is already getting an oversupply. Solar can be turned on and off nearly instantly.\n\nBut ideally you have a secondary thing going that can absorb a lot of power or make a deal with a company like that. You make a deal with them that when power price goes low enough they still buy it from you for what it costs to run the place and when prices go above a certain point you sell to them at a lower rate. This way you aren‚Äôt taking risks and banks are more likely to approve loans, but the maximum possible profit is lower.",

Excess solar from large farms isn‚Äôt a problem like excess hydro power is. You can just turn them off. As far as shortages go, well that‚Äôs also not likely to be an issue as nighttime energy demand is so much lower, other renewables or peak plants can cover it, but you need those regardless.

Historically because they saw it as a tool to nuclear proliferation as it was used to make plutonium.

Including disposal.\n\nCoal ash in the US is actually pretty damn radioactive too. More radiation than 80% of nuclear waste by volume. There is a reason why the US tried to extract uranium for the nuclear program from coal ash in the 70's (and then found it hard to do with the other nasty stuff in there). It would be even more expensive than nuclear energy.\n\nNuclear seems scary, people don't want it near them and there is no long term storage for it yet. Untill people agree to a place to store the actual highly radioactive (but easily contained) spend fuel rods it makes sense they don't want to make even more reactors.\nIt makes sense, just like providing healthcare and maternety leave makes sense but yet it is not being made because of a lack of political determination.",

Once net metering is replaced by net billing, it will take longer, but still its going to be a very reasonable 5-7 years.\n\nYou can also pay by \"giving away\" 33% of your total generated electricity, and in that case grid fees are 0.

For longer surges in demand they're good also as they use no fuel like peaker plants do. They use excess supply from other times instead. For overnight against the lack of sunshine they're not as good as other sources like wind because they are relatively costly. They're great for handling excess production also. Sometimes the grid power is overproduced for grid management reasons, usually producers who can't spin down for various reasons (nuclear or steam boilers). In these times the battery's owner can be paid to absorb the excess, and then later be paid to discharge it when it's needed also.\n\nWith enough batteries the need for peaker plants is reduced or eliminated. This is essential to make the grid fuel free, which stabilizes costs.\n\nGrid batteries rock. Home batteries are great too.",

The winter solstice is in December and so the days get longer almost all of winter. The coldness is caused by the darkness at the poles, which chills the air that blows in. As the increasing daylight hits the poles in early January the air expands and heads away from the pole. They cover this in meteorology class.\n\nThe user who provided the graph probably has their panels angled incorrectly, or has more cloudy days which does reduce power by 20%, or they're leaving snow on or something. If you're truly far North you can put the panels on the walls, vertical mount, for more performance when the sun is low. Whatever the problem, the solution is always just more panels. They're cheap.

Hence you think you need to adjust for solar panel efficiency. But the data sheet ratings are also incorrect, as the nominal ratings are done at STC‚Ä¶ or NOTC:\n\nhttps://solardesignguide.com/stc-and-noct-solar-panel-test-conditions-explained/\n\nAnd that is also incorrect. At utility scale, the projects have to account for vastly more, including tracking or fixed mount, angle to the sun, site specific irradiance and temperature, and so forth. Many have contracted PPA‚Äôs which is built into their financial calculations, so they can‚Äôt be that far off actual output. You can see the various items that go into capacity factor calculations in various reports.\n\nReports like these:\n\nhttps://www.osti.gov/biblio/1764908/\n\nhttps://emp.lbl.gov/tracking-the-sun\n\nThe capacity factor takes much more than simply module efficiency into account and the solar project capacity takes these into account, so that the project nominal capacity already has many more variables modeled to have a much more accurate representation of realistic power output.

Fewer than 50 kids per year are killed in school shootings in the US (and don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this isn't a problem and I'm not saying this shouldn't be addressed). Frankly, you should be far more worried about their trips to and from school - more than 5000 people per year in the US in the 15-24 age group die in car accidents.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying that we shouldn't try to address school shootings, but it's absolutely not something you need to be constantly terrified of.",

Hallucinations and making shit up are really the least of these services flaws.\n\nIt's a great alternative to a thesaurus; if you're writing an email and need an alternative expression or a synonym it's much quicker to ask ChatGPT.

With SADP/SAQP you can push iDUV down to at least 3nm with an equal number of exposures as would be required with an EUV. It‚Äôs not like EUV mono-patterning was ever really a thing anyways.\n\nGiven the complexity, stochasticity, power requirements, it feels like we are already hitting a wall.

How are you going to strengthen your tech sector by giving them money and then having them immediately pay you back that money?\n\nIt's also goes hand in hand with corporate greed and why Americans are getting the shaft right now. It's all related to the coming recession, potential war with China and the US desire to be at the top.\n\nSimply put the US is throwing its own citizens and allies under the bus in the name of capital gains and raking in as much money as possible. Many of our allies are starting to suffer problems and enter recession. But we really don't seem to care.\n\nWe spent the last few years making sure American corporations were flush with cash in the face of the next coming recession. So that when it happens we are the one keeping everyone afloat through loans. Not China like last time. The current economic model will allow that easily. Everybody else will be going broke while our corporations are sitting on large stockpiles of cash.\n\nChina grew fat off keeping everybody alive through loans last recession.

The cost is literally through the stratosphere.\n\nI honestly do not care for intel as a company. They couldn‚Äôt transfer everything they had outside of the US at one time, ungrateful heathens. That side of me says let them do their thing. If they make it great, if they fail, then that is their problem, not the US taxpayer‚Äôs problem. They couldn‚Äôt get out of the US fast enough when I was in college, so let them lie in their own problems\n\nThe other side of me understands the magnitude of the problem. I have a bs and ms in electrical engineering. I studied vlsi design and computer architecture. These are hugely in demand skills but it is incredibly niche. There are probably only a few thousand engineers qualified in that field world wide. That is a pretty small marketplace to get into and fish out of. I realize the cost of these products and the reason why wall street punishes their stocks all of the time.\n\nIs the national security concern real? Yeah, it is probably real to a degree. Intel has fabs and design groups all over the world. Is it overblown? Probably. China has been threatening Taiwan since the Chinese civil war in the late 1940s. Is it driven out of proportion to the actually probability of the threat? Probably. Remember, when it comes to politics, never miss a chance to go all in on a crisis.",

I do hope they get there with 18A, but again no shipped product yet.\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing pushes the edge of what is scientifically possible and attempts to do so in a repeatable manufacturing process with a supply chain that spans the globe.\n\n10 billion is a drop in the bucket.",

For example all of them are reliant on ASML in the Netherlands who provide the most critical step, only Cannon in Japan are even close to the same level and they were already the previous market leader. This is tech that takes 20 years to plan and make.\n\nAs for the actual manufacturing, it's just very expensive, needs a lot of expertise that just isn't in large supply, and takes a very long time to make it happen. The nm size that chips are specified in, currently most often in the 14-2nm range, is litterally counted in atoms, that's the size level we're talking about. Even a spec of dust can damage the chips.\n\nThere's very good reason why AMD, Nvidia, Apple, Hell even Intel is dependent on TSMC and sometimes Samsung for their chip manufacturing.\n\njust search \"why is semiconductor manufacturing so complex\" for more info, but in short, it's very expensive, takes a long time and is one of the most complex things to design there is.",

Engineers are expensive, really really expensive. You can‚Äôt just get people off the street and tell them what to do. I studied vlsi design and computer architectures in college and have a bs and ms in electrical engineering. My skills are complete sh*t because companies like Intel wouldn‚Äôt hire me at the time, so what I learned in school isn‚Äôt worth dick to them. These companies were all running offshore to East Asia. I break bread a different way now. My point is that you can‚Äôt take union labor and turn them into semiconductor engineers, it takes years and years of training to understand what is happening down in the semiconductor material. When something goes wrong, it takes more than a visual inspection. It‚Äôs hard for people to grasp the size and magnitudes that are being discussed. Problems at 2nm can‚Äôt just be fixed by looking at something for defects with your naked eye.\n\nA state of the art fab has multiple of these machines from asmr. Clean rooms are expensive because an atom of dust in the wrong spot ruins things. Design work is expensive.\n\nAsml machines are hundreds of millions. The design work is hundreds of millions. The engineers are probably $300k per years if not more, and you have to have a lot of them. People are a multi year commitment.\n\nNone of this is easy. Intel is currently going through the alpha process for their 16th gen CPUs. Their 14th gen was just announced and I‚Äôm not sure if it is shipping in quantity. So, you‚Äôll go thru a couple of years with you just spending cash, think billions, with no income.\n\nThere are probably some EEs in the semiconductor area that can explain this 1000x better than I can.",

Especially when both pieces of information look reasonable.\n\nThey were hoping to win this argument and basically make themselves immune to any issues with their chatbot by pointing back at this and going \"See? We can't be held liable for anything our chatbot says, heres the legal precedence for it!\" which would mean that they could replace customer service much more aggressively with GAI and not have to care if it lies, makes things up, or causes problems for their users. After all the money saved by not paying people would make up for the issues there.\n\nThey don't want to have to care if their chatbot is accurate or trained well or if it hallucinates answers to its users, they just want to cut down on customer service by replacing them with GAI as cheaply as possible. They don't want to have to vet the answers their chatbot gives. They just want it in place and \"working\".",

Simple example:\n\nNintendo is valued at $100.\n\nWith a new switch release you estimate Nintendo will be valued at $140.\n\nIf you wait until the day before the release, people will have already bought Nintendo up to $140 in anticipation of the release. So you need to buy it early enough before the release so you can actually make money. The earlier you buy, the more you stand to make, but also the longer you have to wait, tying your money up in the process.\n\nSo as time moves on, more and more of the new switches release gets baked into Nintendos value. So even without a release date or a plan, people are aware it‚Äôs on the horizon and have started to buy into Nintendo hoping to buy early enough to make money, but not too early that their money is just sitting there and doing nothing.\n\nWith a delay, or slower progress than anticipated, people are moving money out of Nintendo because it‚Äôs not going to raise as fast as they had wanted.\n\nIt‚Äôs not that Nintendo is a bad bet, it‚Äôs that they can use that same money to make money elsewhere before pivoting back into Nintendo.\n\nBasically the new Switch is already being baked into Nintendos value slowly. The more time goes on, the more it will have an effect.",

Thus, I have an incentive to buy now and sell later when the stock price has increased, but by buying now I already increase the demand for your company's stocks and as more investor think like me the stock price of your company rises toward the expected value we think you will have once you got the new oranges.\n\nHowever now you announce that the new oranges will only arrive in 1 year. I could wait or I could sell now (just driving the price of the stock down as more people are selling) and do the same calculation with another company selling grape juice that will soon get some new high quality grape.",

If there is emerging market for them i think that they are overvalued. They are not offering unique or irreplaceable products. Good products but not 80 billion valuation brand.\n\nIn Porsche case they got macan ev coming that might be a hit. But taycan is not doing well.

I believe that software as it is today wasn't deployed to solve these issues because software that handles data is very rigid... at the end of the day it needs a pattern of data that conforms to a data contract for further processing and storage.\n\nWe can add rules to the system by adding gates to invoke operations based on various conditions... but that gets expensive and isn't as agile as we'd hoped it would be. Inevitably, conditions start to contradict themselves unless they're scoped into more and more granular decisions.\n\nAll in all, managing the complexity is burdensome and requires large amounts of time to implement and specialized skills to implement and maintain systems.\n\nWhat a person brings to the table is the ability to reason about the data and make decisions on what the best next steps are and what resources can be deployed to resolve an issue.\n\nAI is a good middle ground here because it works on probability. Given a weighted set of conditions it can follow a logical set of instructions based upon the probability score.\n\nIt won't be correct all the time, but it will eventually perform to the level of the person (who is also not correct all the time); and eventually it will win the overall correctness race.\n\nI think we will see AI become the tool that can finally start offloading jobs that needed to perform some data rationalization... specifically if that rationalization was in regard to what steps need to happen to resolve problematic data. That being said, jobs that need to rationalize or create new things (imagineering if you will) and physically interact with the world will be the most AI resistant.",

That's a lot of empty real estate and leftover money and supply. After this age/era space has to be explored and humans need to colonize other planets\n\nNext step though is unifying the whole Earth with one system, economically, politically, blah blah etc\n\nUntil then let these lunatic rich people enjoy their fake money , real life is going to get real for rich people to actually solve and participate in issues , sure they're trying global genocide hear and their but that's not ethical at all with fake wars, disease, drugs, vaccines, food poisoning, cancer, etc\n\nWhy I say? Okay, let's look at history. This is already a done deal. It's not even made up. Just look at all the past events. All those big events, especially into an illness, health and war. This is already common sense. It's just to curb the population from growing too fast because they know that we can't really handle having more people supplying enough food for billions of people and we will run out obviously of resources. Remember resources are scarce. There's no such thing as an abundance. Every planet has a burn rate of resources\n\nTo bring my points further in is that although there's going to be less people in the future unless we start colonizing sooner, the needs of an economy is to just be able to get people to work towards goal that other people that know what should be done and when that is done and it's fulfilled. The next step is still only keep a few people at the end of the day. It's just going to be a game of survival, kind of like the show 100.\n\nSo what does this have to do with? Like AI wrapping up in this valuation. It's simple the turning point of this era is coming soon and after this A I bubble crash or whatever that new era will start\n\nThe real people in charge of this world think decades ahead and probably centuries and already have plans and you and I.

It also outlined the benefits of having a healthy grass lawn. 1 acre meets the oxygen needs of 64 active adults each day, cleans the air, creates a microclimate in the immediate area where air is cooler & more humid. All can be done naturally, with no chemicals, no regular watering. I've always heard lawns are such a waste of resources, so costly, unfriendly to the environment. All lies. It just takes a little planning to do things right",

But, as noted by the NYT, it also adds that ‚Äúthe structure of the N.L.R.B. violates the separation of powers.‚Äù\n\nIn other words, Amazon is claiming that the NLRB has too much power for a single entity because it‚Äôs capable of creating rules, investigating violations, and determining whether a company broke laws.",

            "comment": "Let's cut right to it. This is the \"administrative state\" that is in the sights of the US Supreme Court. The sharks smell blood in the water and are moving in for a big kill.\n\nThe N.L.R.B. was created by an act of Congress in 1935. To quote that wikipedia article, the act guarantees the right of private sector employees to organize into trade unions, engage in collective bargaining, and take collective action such as strikes.\n\nCongress can and does pass legislation using broad strokes for such goals, and delegates power to make specific rules that accomplish those goals to the executive branch.\n\nThere was concern that Congress was giving too much power to the executive and so 11 years later Congress passed the Administrative Procedure Act to put more general guardrails around all the new agencies created out of FDR's New Deal and subsequent agencies that would be created in later years. Quoting wikipedia again: it is one of the most important pieces of United States administrative law, and serves as a sort of \"constitution\" for U.S. administrative law.... and functions as \"a bill of rights for the hundreds of thousands of Americans whose affairs are controlled or regulated\" by federal government agencies.\n\nSo, Congress sets broad goal(s) and creates an agency, giving the executive branch authority to use that agency to achieve the stated goals. When there are violations, the cases are heard by administrative law judges. Last wiki quote: In the United States, the United States Supreme Court has recognized that the role of a federal administrative law judge is \"functionally comparable\" to that of an Article III judge. An ALJ's powers are often, if not generally, comparable to those of a trial judge, as ALJs may issue subpoenas, rule on proffers of evidence, regulate the course of the hearing, and make or recommend decisions.... In American administrative law, ALJs are Article I judges under the U.S. Constitution. As such, they do not exercise full judicial power, essentially, the power over life, liberty, and property.\n\nThe upshot here is that we have remedies and control. If an agency is no longer serving its purpose or the purpose itself is no longer desirable, we can lobby and/or elect a new Congress to repeal what it created (or to modify how those rules are enforced by ALJs).\n\nThere is no real separation of powers concern here. Companies like Amazon, SpaceX and Trader Joes want to neuter laws Congress has passed that hinder their ability to make profits.",

The problem with this, of course, is that Congress does not really want or have time to spend drafting, debating, and voting on _every federal regulation that exists_. Agencies operate with congressional mandates, and this is a materially effective way of functioning. It allows Congress to tell the FDA \"keep disease out of the food supply\" and the FDA can determine the safe limit for the percent of your ground beef that is really rat meat (or bugs, or straw, or plastic...). Regulations are updated and refined as studies are conducted (or lawsuits won by corporations, sadly); and are not static common-law mandates.\n\nRequiring all regulation to be passed by Congress would effectively halt all regulation for a while--and when there's no law about how much salmonella is allowed in a sample of beef before it's sold off the supermarket shelves...well. Lots of people will get salmonella.\n\nHistory is full of this kind of awful appeal to the past, and the groups who wield such arguments tend towards extremism and tend to make things materially worse for a lot of people.",
