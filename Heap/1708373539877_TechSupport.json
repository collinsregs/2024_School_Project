Get an Arris modem, and then get a router or mesh network like an Eero. It'll auto use 2.4/5 as needed, and give you no more problems.\n\nSometimes the answer is to stop relying on free shit from your provider and use something that is actually going to be useful.\n\nAlso, it's not free, because you're leasing the modem/router from them and are paying a monthly fee.",

From there you can see if it's enabled, and if it is, you can disable it. Be aware it takes some time because it will go through and decrypt everything.",

Fair enough. But I don`t get the expensive office chairs like the Herman Millar that cost substantially more and are made from mesh.\n\nLike, when I`m in front of my desktop, I am here for 10 odd hours usually.

If you don't have any zip software installed, right click on the folder and select Send to → Compressed (Zipped) folder.\n\nUpload to any easy to use file sharing site. Reddit keeps blacklisting file hosts so find something that works, currently catbox.moe or mediafire.com seems to be working.\n\nWe like to have multiple dump files to work with so if you only have one dump file, none or not a folder at all, upload the ones you have and then follow this guide to change the dump type to Small Memory Dump.

Even though for other appliances, the difference isn't big enough to make a difference.\n\nSome people in places with power issues use UPS (uninterrupted power supply - essentially a battery) to iron out some issues with power. They are supposed to give you a few minutes to save your work and shut down during a power outage, but maybe they could help \"charge up\" from the low power to start the machine, then once it's running there is enough passive power to keep everything running?\n\nThe PC will use peak power when under load, tho. So it's possible that this wouldn't really help too much.\n\nIdk, I'm really not sure if that is a good idea, and it probably wouldn't be a cheap experiment either.",

A computer without enough power to run properly could cause damage to itself or be unable to check if there is a fault.\n\nThe only way to test if the power supply is \"working\" under these conditions is to compare it with a power supply you know is undamaged, or to use a multi-meter to probe the connections to see if they are outputting the correct voltages.\n\nIf the motherboard isn't getting enough voltage to even give an error, then you won't be able to tell the difference between a broken PSU and not enough power without testing the PSU directly or replacing the PSU with a known working one.",

Or it could be related to the bearing(s) on the spinning disks.\n\nI would suggest backing up any important data on that drive immediately. Run CrystalDiskInfo if you want to see the health of the drive, but it sounds like it would be a good idea to replace it. A faulty drive could competely fail tomorrow, and you'd be looking at a very expensive bill from professionals if you wanted that data recovered.",

This could be malicious, but usually just means whomever didn't feel like paying for a certificate, or it wasn't worth it to do so. Everything from your printer, to your wireless router uses these untrusted encryption certificates.\n\nAn HTTP site is just a website that doesn't use encryption.\n\nTLDR; untrusted or non secure sites don't mean anything really.

The actual writing speed relies more on the storage cells which for cheap flash memory cells haven't even passed the old 2.0 speed. That writing speed is to be expected, the initial surge is either from your PC caching write operation or the drive itself has a built-in write buffer (it's faster to buffer write operations and do them in one go, which also improves the cell's longevity). And yes, read operations tend to be faster, because it's just a measurement process, unlike write operations where they need to change the cell state.",

The current 1TB HDD uses the sata interface to connect to your laptop's motherboard...\n\nTo use a second M.2 drive, you'll need to buy an adapter (ie sata to M.2). Search Amazon/ebay or equivalent to buy one...",

Dump files are crash logs from BSODs.\n\nIf you can get into Windows normally or through Safe Mode could you check C:\\Windows\\Minidump for any dump files? If you have any dump files, copy the folder to the desktop, zip the folder and upload it. If you don't have any zip software installed, right click on the folder and select Send to → Compressed (Zipped) folder.\n\nUpload to any easy to use file sharing site. Reddit keeps blacklisting file hosts so find something that works, currently catbox.moe or mediafire.com seems to be working.\n\nWe like to have multiple dump files to work with so if you only have one dump file, none or not a folder at all, upload the ones you have and then follow this guide to change the dump type to Small Memory Dump.

If that pattern holds it could mean you have a faulty CPU core. Two isn't enough to make me confident that's the problem so please do make any new dump files available for comparison if the crashes continue.",

It can persist through a factory reset. Firmware is the low-level code that initializes hardware before the operating system starts, and it's not typically affected by a factory reset.\n\nWhile the chances of your machine being affected in this way is slim. There's always a possibility.\n\nLessons should be learned. Don't download sketchy programs from untrusted sources.

Since that doesn't work, I guess you could try booting a Windows installation medium, opening a command prompt with Shift+F10 and running the command \"mbr2gpt /convert\". This will convert the drive to UEFI booting, but isn't completely risk free, there's a very small chance you'll lose the contents of the drive. I've used this tool many times though and it has never happened to me.\n\nMoving a drive to a different system isn't officially supported and may not work. You'll have to see how things go, but you may have to reinstall anyway.\n\nThe reason you can't install Windows on the drive is closely related to why this doesn't work, the drive is configured for legacy booting with an MBR. The Windows setup is booted in UEFI mode and Windows knows you can't boot from an MBR drive (without CSM enabled).",

Most likely the cat pee is causing the problems, not a random SSD failure unless you got something like a weird brand like those cheap Chinese ssds like kingwin or timetec or something.\n\nSlowly start eliminating the components that could go wrong with a separate working PC. Problem is you need a spare PC to investigate your problem.\n\nIt probably isn't your power supply that is damaged. Not your GPU. Maybe your ram and maybe your CPU. I think it is probably your motherboard based on the weird behaviors you listed. If you had more consistent errors I would narrow it down to a specific component like an SSD, ram, CPU, GPU, power supply, etc.\n\nAnd the wire for your power switch could lead the cat pee directly to the multiple power reset HDD activity pins on your motherboard.",

(No I don't know how they work lol).\n\nThe point is that most casual Internet users don't host things and therefore will never realise or care that they are under CGNAT. If you ask, some ISPs will give you a publicly addressable IP in order to facilitate hosting (the \"normal\" IP you mentioned). This depends heavily on the ISP, some do it for free, some will charge you extra and some outright do not support \"normal\" IP addresses anymore. Definitely worth opening up a support ticket with your ISP to see if they can accommodate your needs. (I just saw in another thread that you intend to host some applications).",

Also, if your ISP does employ CGNAT, there can then be immensely more problems vis-à-vis your own port-forwarding (NAT within your own router).\nTo be reliably found by others outside of your premises, you need a Static IP Address. Otherwise, your address will be constantly changing from time-to-time. (BOGON addresses are totally unreliable, often blocked, and technically highly illegal.) Or, you need to be going through an additional service that keeps track of your always then current address (like, say, just for simple conceptual reference, GoToMyPC; there are many others).",

I remember on my first day some dude asks me about toasters, I'm like \"oh sorry I'm kind of new I'll let my colleague help you\" I assumed he had been trained on them or something, after he helped the customer he was like \"dude I don't know any more about toasters than you lol, you gotta bullshit whenever a customer asks yout about stuff.\" I would then just bullshit and say the most obvious shit like \"oh what's your price range\" \"mid range\" \"oh well if you're looking for a mid range toaster this one is great, it does this and this\" and just read off the box. Some people are just indecisive and want you to make a decision for them.",

I have a Asus TUF personally which I bought about 2 years ago I think. I can play helldivers 2 on the highest settings.\n\nWhat is absolutely vital is that it has a dedicated GPU - remember that, it's extremely important. Either Nvidia or AMD. I have an NVidia 3070 RTX. I don't know the AMD models that well. But you can compare them with Nvidia. You need to have at least a 3060 imo. 3060 being towards the lower end, 3070 mid. Keep in mind that this is an older generation. The newest generation of Nvidia are the 4000 series. So the equivalent of 3070 is now 4070. Sort of, the newer one is obviously more powerful, but usually by not that much.\n\nI also recommend a minimum of 16gb of ram and a good cpu, so at least an i7. My laptop has the above specs (16 gb ram, i7, 3070) and never had issues running any game in 2 years.\n\nIf you find something and you're not sure, best to ask here. Someone with more knowledge can help. I'm not an expert either, but I have a general idea. Good luck!\n\nEdit: better yet, check this subreddit r/GamingLaptops these guys are pros",

Maybe someone needs it for work or school, you could sell it as such. And then look into the ones I've mentioned.\n\nAs to what's cheapest, that's very hard to say. But I don't think you can find something decent under 1k. Maybe 800 if you're really lucky and find something 2nd hand. But as you don't have any experience, I wouldn't buy 2nd hand. GPU can be fried, or RAM might be missing, all sorts of problems\n\nSo if you want cheap, 2nd hand I guess. But I personally would not buy a gaming laptop 2nd hand. I highly recommend that you don't do that.\n\nIt's not easy, you would have to do a lot of research online. Your best bet is to try and sell it, even underpriced and buy a new one",

I have an older model (a 910 iirc) with an i7 that a client never came to pick up that its pretty much a super expensive paper weight because the charge board got busted, and the replacement is stupid expensive for what it is (around 180 USD for the part only, and thats in USA, here in Mexico they dont sell it at all).

Then check prices of computers with those requirement and a bit higher (future proofing) to see if your budget allows.

Just based on your post it doesn't seem like you're very computer savvy - and unless you've suddenly become really motivated to get into the hobby and learn, it's just going to be cheaper, simpler, and ultimately more rewarding for you to just play console games. I'm not discouraging you from getting in to it - PC gaming is a great hobby, and it has opened a lot of doors for me - but it isn't for everyone.\n\nIf you do decide to continue down this path I would seriously recommend that you start with an online course on the basics of computing, or a \"for dummies\" book, or something along those lines. Stumbling your way through buying or building/maintaining a gaming rig can (and likely will) result in much costlier mistakes than this one.\n\nYou could potentially explore buying an external GPU if you're determined to game on the Yoga, but that doesn't seem like a great option to me. If you can return it or sell it and you want a quick alternative, you could probably find a Lenovo Legion of some variety for around the same price point, which is a gaming laptop. Good luck!",

Since you don't know about pc's I'll explain.\n\nThat has an integrated gpu (igpu). Which means it's their to show images on your laptop screen. Every computer needs a gpu in order to see an image on a monitor or a display. In the old times you needed a dedicated gpu. Now they have an igpu. Which means that it uses some part of cpu as an gpu. So it can give a display out to the laptop. It's good for normal tasks but not for gaming.\n\nIt lacks vram, most of them have 128mb.whichnks not enough to play modern games even at low settings. Older games may work very because of the good cpu. For modern games at least 4gb is recommended. It means 4000mb in vram. See the difference. Most dedicated gpus at least have 4gb of vram minimum.\n\nSo return that laptop and get your money back",

For 1400 you could easily buy a hybrid of used and new parts for a sweet pc that will smash most games. Because of the work I do, I have a 4k monitor that I play games on with a Ryzen 3700x and a 3060 at around 60fps on low to medium graphics and its great for me. I've seen similar complete setups for as low as 700 Euros and the dollar price is usually about the same in the second hand market as far as I can see.\n\nThere always seems to be something scammy about buying prebuilts and laptops from chain markets. There always 1 or 2 scam parts or things missing. Cheap power supplies, celeron processors.\n\nI tried to upgrade a second hand HP laptop I bought from a guy that said he bought it at one of these places.

There will be a momentary disruption in network connectivity while the hardware resets. Reason: The network driver requested that it be reset . This network interface has reset 4 time(s) since it was last initialized.\n\n\nThat happened shortly before that crash.\n\nThe next dump file has events suggesting Windows blocked calls from Chrome for security reasons:\n\n[Microsoft-Windows-Security-Mitigations/KERNEL_MITIGATION_TASK_PROHIBIT_WIN32K_SYSTEM_CALLS/]Process '\\Device\\HarddiskVolume3\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe' (PID 24124) was blocked from making system calls to Win32k.sys\n\n\nThe next dump file has events that suggest diagnostics were being performed followed by networking related function being called - possibly due to a network adapter being reset.\n\nThe last dump file also has events about blocking calls to win32k.sys shortly before the crash.\n\nDoes Reliability Monitor show a pattern of problems starting after a network driver was updated, perhaps?

This can re-introduce a buggy setting that has been giving you grief, as this process assumes you want to re-apply all core OS settings you have backed up to iCloud.\nWipe the phone and set up your phone fresh, BUT delay hooking into iCloud until after the wizard ends and you are dumped to normal phone operations. This ensures that core phone settings are set to default, and that anything iCloud syncs back down will be for third-party programs and your own personal data (Photos, files, downloads, etc.). This allows you to eliminate core OS glitches from being re-applied to a fresh setup.\n\nIt’s been a while since I have had to do № 2, for either myself or clients, but I haven’t come across any indications that it doesn't still work like this.",

Most of the time, they don't even have any thermal management, just a bare die.\n\nGiven several assumptions, I think this is the inside of your laptop, with the PCH circled. Bare die, nothing to suck away heat. Because it's not supposed to need heat management. If it's getting so hot that your laptop is shutting off, then something is broken. There's a short somewhere on your motherboard or in the PCH chip, and too much power is being drawn. It could theoretically be cheaper to do component level repair rather than to replace the whole motherboard, but that requires specialized skills and equipment. Someone like Northridge Fix could probably handle it. Otherwise you're looking at a motherboard replacement.\n\nYou could theoretically attach a tiny heatsink to the die, and that'd probably get you an extra couple of minutes before the system shut down. Problem is, you need airflow across a heatsink for it to work well, and laptops don't have much.\n\nYou could also stack up several copper shims to the right height so that the PCH can sink heat to the bottom of the laptop, the same way that the NVMe drives do. You'll need some thermal adhesive to attach the shims together, and to attach your newly made copper block to the case. And a thermal pad to interface the block to the PCH die. That might work long term, especially if you get a cooling pad to blow air at the bottom of your laptop.",
