The amount of funding it takes to develop an airliner ain't even funny, even if they do it you can count of years upon years of testing where they're making zero money before FAA/EASA would let one fly. Even if they develop batteries good enough for this, you'd also need airports equipped to service your plane, extensive pilots and mechanics training, it'd be a massive gamble for an airline.\n\nI have a feeling this is less a serious attempt at making one, and more an attempt at just making some kind of tech that's good enough to sell their company to an established manufacturer where it'd probably go to die unfortunately.",

And we do that together with renowned research institutes,” Wolleswinkel says.\n\nElysian is working with German aerospace center DLR as well as Royal NLR, TU Delft and Twente Technical University in the Netherlands. “The idea is to make sure those projects give us the green light to go into detail design. We want to finalize these projects by the end of 2024 or early 2025,” he says.\n\n“We’re in risk reduction now. We are doing research on the hot potatoes, a list of elements that during the conceptual design we said are the technical challenges that can maybe make or break the design, but at least have a large impact,” de Vries says.\n\nso they're planning to make a plan on how to plan the airliner",

It can not tell you anything about what it is like to experience those emotions beyond vague generalities.\n\nHow does the \"angry\" I feel when I'm cut off in traffic compare to the \"angry\" I feel when I found out a close friend lied to me? What's the difference between the \"sad\" I feel when I see a freezing beggar and the \"sad\" I feel when my cat dies?\n\nWe like to pretend that understanding the underlying physical phenomena that drive emotion gives us understanding of emotions themselves, but my friend... if that is the case, why do humans still struggle with depression? Heartbreak? Rage? Jealousy? Why do we still have school shootings, why are our divorce rates so high, why are suicide rates climbing?\n\nWe really need to stop conflating findings of the scientific method to capital \"T\"\" TRUTH. It conditions us to think much too evaluatively about the relationship between ourselves and the universe at large. If something can't be measured or defined or objectively observed, it might as well not exist. I'm not sure how to peer-review what it feels like to catch a baseball, but I could walk out into my backyard and experience it right now if I wanted to.",

        "comment": "I recommend watching talks by Peter Ziehan. While Automation and AI are going to play huge parts in our future, Demographics will likely be the big shift over the next 5-10 years.\n\nFor the United States.\n\nBaby Boomers are retiring, half have already retired and the vast majority of the other half are going to retire by 2030. They were the largest generational workforce in American history, they were the largest (or 2nd largest, behind their children, the Millennials) but they were also a generation where women working was very common.\n\nGen Z, the up and coming Generation is much smaller. The difference between the Baby Boomers retiring and Gen Z entering the workforce age is a deficit of about 400,000 people per year and will actually ramp up. Accoridng to Zeihan it will be nearly a million per year by 2030.\n\nEver since the Boomers have entered their working ages in the late 60s (when the oldest boomers were in their early 20s) there has been a huge abundance of labor. Companies were built around the mentality that labor is easily replaceable. For as long as Boomers have been working (certain the younger half, who are now hitting their 70s), you could easily replace employees.\n\nThis new shift is changing that whole labor ecosystem. That whole \"no one wants to work!\" mentality is going to get much worse and its really that our existing corporate and business leadership doesn't have any experience in an ecosystem where there is a labor shortage. This labor shortage is going to get worse and worse. Eventually businesses are going to have to be in a position where if they want to keep talent, they are going to have to pay them well.\n\nThere are something like 100 mega factories either being planned or are already under construction in the United States. There are also many going in with our partner country, Mexico. In order for America to keep our level of consumption, particularly with technology, we have to replace SE Asian manufacturing with Mexican manufacturing. We will still be trading with Japan and Vietnam, but China and South Korea are facing demographic collapse. These 100+ factories are going to each employ thousands of people.\n\nThere is not going to be America vs Mexico. We are all NAFTA now. Its AmericaMexicoCanada with a few other partners vs the world. We are now on the same side. Organized labor is likely going to have the greatest amount of leverage in the 2030s since like the 1950s. That whole \"Grandpa had a good factory job in 1955 and afforded a family and a comfortable lifestyle\" story, well his great grand kids are going to have that in 2035. Much of this is going to be involved with solar, wind, batteries and all of the products that go with them and the US South is going to be a HUGE player. Look at what is going on in Georgia right now with their major factory investments. The Texas Triangle is going to be a huge power player in the future.\n\nWe are probably going to have to spend hundreds of billions or even a trillion dollars on massive infrastructure upgrades which will bring Mexico into the American system. Heavy rail lines to link up Mexican industry to American industry, highway construction, and maybe even some high speed passenger rail to link up places like Monterrey to the Texas Triangle.\n\nEurope is going to be a total fucking mess. The largest manufacturer, Germany, is heading towards mass retirement with a tiny replacement generation and is overly dependent on Russian energy and raw materials. The UK has left the EU and needs to do whatever they can to make a trade partnership with the US.\n\nThere are going to be many industries disrupted. Much of them will have to do with fossil fuel consumption. A lot of mechanics will be disrupted (granted, they will be fairly easy to retrain for working on other equipment, we are going to have a shortage of people who can fix and maintain things). Automation is going to replace jobs, AI is going to replace jobs, but we need so much more production in the US that its not going to matter. We need to more than double the US industrial output.",

Batteries are being developed to work from cheaper chemistries.\n\nThe demand for batteries, in both automotive, stationary storage, and home storage is enormous. There are 100 million households in America and every single one of them is going to need a home battery. Even at some fairly low margin that can still be a $100B profit.\n\nI think there is also an overestimation for how much solar power we need. The sunbelt needs on the order of 8kw per person (for all commercial and residential including transportation, but probably not industrial). About 800 square feet. When you whack it up, really not that much. 1 square mile of solar is enough for about 40,000 people.

People think of the US playing world's policeman as invading various countries, while that was part of it, and a really ugly part of it. The real US Global Police man has had the job of securing the world's oceans. This way any country could get their goods anywhere else using secured shipping lanes.\n\nChina in particular got wealthy from this. Nearly all the wealth China has now is because the US made it safe for them to ship things to the US and Europe. Shipping from China to Europe is a very long route, and is full of many places where lots of things can go wrong, pirates or state actors could easily start seizing Chinese cargo ships. But it is the same for everyone. Look at the Suez Canal, its one of the most important corridors in the world, and without the US Navy, security becomes a big issue.\n\nThe US is stepping back from that role. A lot of routes are going to be difficult to insure. Australia is in a good position that it can ship things to the United States, or South America, and it would be very difficult for any hostile actors to be lurking around the pacific ocean.

Then it was going to be OS 10, but it wasn't ready and the development was getting progressively more complicated and difficult so Apple started looking outside the company for the next OS. They considered options like buying the company that made BeOS, but ended up buying Next and getting NextStep (which became OSX) and Steve jobs in the process.

That group of users needed something right away, and Zoom was the least bad option for them.\n\nOn my end during the pandemic, I attended hundreds of teams meetings,a few Cisco WebEx meetings, but not a single Zoom meeting.\n\nI deal with some of the most well known manufacturing companies in the world and still never once a Zoom meeting, but I'm in half a dozen teams meetings every week if not more to this day.\n\nSkype was a technology buy, they bought it to integrate it into Teams.

MS culturally isn't comfortable with that much risk and have a fuller commitment when they go for a project, plus there is a very very strong legal culture to 'protect' MS but actually seems to stifle innovation. MS also largely exited consumer products space. I'm really excited that since Satya has been leading the company they seem involved with much more innovation and forward looking products. Here are a few: https://startuptalky.com/microsoft-failed-products/ - but the difference is that most of the internal Microsoft failed projects are cancelled during testing by management without being launched as an 'alpha' product. They have a well established internal test community and only viable products make it out - where other companies are more comfortable with 'betas' going out to the public.",

I haven't investigated this deeply enough to say with any authority. Of course, even if it were true, the Xbox brand is still going strong, which could net them a profit in the future. Having some control over the gaming industry is probably also somewhat beneficial to the profitability of their other products, but I have to imagine that portion would be pretty marginal at best.",

It allows the producer to market its products – currently priced similarly to premium conventional beef – in the country, with plans to roll out at restaurants and, eventually, retailers.\n\nWith the greenlight, Israel joins a very short list of countries to allow the sale of cultured meat – only Singapore (Eat Just in 2020) and the US (Upside Foods and Eat Just in 2023) have done so. But these approvals were all done for cell-based chicken products, meaning Aleph Farms is the first company permitted to sell cultivated beef.\n\nPlease reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/19937fi/israel_becomes_first_country_to_allow_sale_of/kib92dy/",

Activating anything with electricity is forbidden because it's considered the same as lighting a fire?

Orthodox Judaism forbids \"carrying\" items from a private area to a public one. However, by using string or wires, a larger amount of space can be combined into one area for the purpose of this tenet, allowing people to bring their keys, canes, etc. when they leave their house on Shabbat.",

However, further research is required as this is an incredibly green field of study.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that these is any severe nutritional impact as the composition of the cell and the proteins used to grow them are near identical",

It allows the producer to market its products – currently priced similarly to premium conventional beef – in the country, with plans to roll out at restaurants and, eventually, retailers.\n\nWith the greenlight, Israel joins a very short list of countries to allow the sale of cultured meat – only Singapore (Eat Just in 2020) and the US (Upside Foods and Eat Just in 2023) have done so. But these approvals were all done for cell-based chicken products, meaning Aleph Farms is the first company permitted to sell cultivated beef.",

It could enable same sex couples to have biologically related children and allow extremely large groups of people to make equal genetic contribution.

It could enable same sex couples to have biologically related children and allow extremely large groups of people to make equal genetic contribution.

During the same process, DNA methylation, or epigenetic patterns are reset to factory default, with some imperfect cleaning. You do inherit some adaptations your parents acquired during their life, notably responses from excess stress. When you make a clone, you can't use meiosis because even if you are your own father and mother, recombination will just make you the most inbred organism possible, and not an exact copy. To make an exact copy you need to stick to mitosis, so you end up inheriting old DNA, as u/g0ing_postal described.",

What about when cloning goes wrong. What about the implications of starting the ball rolling towards mass production of humans, eugenics, starting a new class of people intentionally, it’s just an insane can of real worms before bringing god into the mix. Its not so much that it feels wrong I’d say it is objectively wrong on many levels but our world is built on wrong so it depends if there’s just enough reason to counteract that wrong",

Generalizing, that means about 15% of each generation have the skills to eventually contribute to a project that would greatly “benefit mankind”.\n\nDoubling the 15% to 30% to be more lenient towards other majors and such, that still means a majority of jobs don’t contribute to the betterment of mankind, regardless of how greatly skilled someone needs to be to work them. For example, electricians are greatly skilled, but their impact is not global i.e. they’re not bettering mankind as a whole.\n\nIn fact, many of the problems our society faces is impacted by overpopulation and over-corporatization including climate change, academic decline (increasing student to teacher ratio), increasing food costs, access to clean drinking water, difficulty upkeeping infrastructure, etc…",

This is why I said cultures.\n\nLike every other culture I have encountered (and I have encountered more than the average bear) white American culture can be further broken down into more specific lineages)\n\nSub cultures are a thing, as are melting pot cultures. Most North Americans of danish decent I know are more a product of melting pot culture than sub culture. Although those two aren’t discrete or distinct characteristics.\n\nIt’s still culture. Even if it isn’t “pure” (not that there really is a such thing as a pure culture anyways, except for possibly the North Sentinalese)\n\nHell I know Danish culture quite well. And that definitely is not a pure culture either. You have sub cultures, like Fynsk culture for example, or Jutlander culture, and then you also have the influence of the Germans, English, and Dutch, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, and Faroese, who readily and often integrate into Danish culture.",

Point in case - I know a fair amount of Danes that aren’t white, but absolutely are culturally Danish. So… Are they a part of white culture? If you’re a white person, you could be proud of a specific cultural heritage, or multiple cultural heritages, but… white culture? Just seems like their families didn’t keep track of their history. I have never experienced any animosity towards specific white sub-cultures, except from other white people. Ie. French people and Germans. Swedes and Danes ragging on each other, etc. but I sure do hear a lot of animosity towards people that identify with a monolithic “white” culture. Mostly because those people tend to be clueless and casually awful, bordering on willfully ignorant.\n\nPS. Not going to lie. Was surprised when you whipped out Fynske Culture 😂 Obviously I live in the states, but that’s where I’m from. Where are you from/how do you know about Danish regional cultures?",

As well as the ancestral Danes with very little to do with the culture.

Many people still struggle with being comfortable around people that \"feel\" or look different than them.

In more recent history, as recently as 1959, land was stolen or acquired through warfare against the people already living there ie Hawaii, Arizona and New Mexico. Mexico, with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, lost 55% of its territory as a conquered state. I understand people back then being on board with land acquisition through warfare but can't you, in 2024, see more nuance than \"I beat you so this is mine\".\n\nThe idea that \"white people\" have a right to maintain a homogenous, white ethno-state to the exclusion of people who were there before or who were even brought in and abused is fundamentally racist. It's not replacement, it's making space for people that aren't white, Christian and English-speaking.",

Plus a lot of the Spanish that settled Latin America weren't even 100% European themselves, which is why there's very often traces of north African and other regions in the DNA of people in Latin America.",

The backlash to that was Trump being elected, which further drove the GOP into a more hardline white christian nationalist movement and the Democratic Party into the described multicultural state. And this is what the current fight in US politics is about because white non-christians have largely aligned with those minority populations, while white christians, now in the numerical minority (as opposed to the cultural or institutional minority) struggle to win national elections and are turning to other non-democratic mechanisms to hold power.",

Politically, the way they vote will be nearly indistinguishable from the way other Americans vote. Chinese and Indians will be \"Sorta White\" in the way Jewish Americans are already (Jews being a group that in Europe were traditionally considered \"white\").\n\nEvidence: It's already the case that Latino's are trending away from voting democrat. Many of the most famous Latino politicians today are republicans (think Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, probably the two highest profile Latino politicians in the USA). Also, Latinos tend to be socially conservative (most are devout Catholics or Born Again Christians). Plenty of Latinos don't see current GOP anti-immigration rhetoric as a reason not to vote GOP. Finally, most Latino countries have the same racial dynamics as the USA, only with a larger indigenous/Mestizo population. Most Latinos in the USA today are white, and it's not surprising that they'll align with being white in the American racial system, seeing as they had such a status in their native country's \"system\".\n\nFinally, as to Chinese/Indians becoming white adjacent, there's a very large well-integrated Indian/Chinese community in the USA today who are 2nd or even 3rd or 4th generation. Many are business owners or elite professionals, and their politics end up being roughly similar to Jewish Americans who also match that profile IE favouring liberal tolerance/being against christian dominionism as in the GOP, but being otherwise being pro-establishment/pro-capitalist/anti-socialist/centre right. If the GOP shifted away from the Christian Right, you could imagine the Republicans capturing these voters fairly easily. You can already see this with a figure like Vivek Ramaswamy, Elaine Chao, or Nikki Haley(born Nimarata Nikki Randhawa). In fact there seems to be more Indians in the Republican Party then the Democrats...\n\nTLDR: I don't think the democrats should be betting on changing demographics guaranteeing them political power for the next century. It assumes that those minorities are not going to assimilate into the \"white\" majority.",

Racial dynamics there is also quite similar to the USA, with a fairly hard racial division between Black and White Brazilians, this is likely down to both countries having extensive systems of Slavery. In most Latin American countries the people you describe as \"Mestizo\" are de facto white (though it's really more of a spectrum, rather then an American style binary). Most importantly, politically, Mestizos in Latin America behave like whites in America, IE they're as likely to vote right wing as not and they're part of the \"mainstream\".\n\nFurthermore, White Latinos make up a disproportionate proportion of the Latino population in America compared to Latin America(as they are wealthier and better able to migrate). In 2010, 50% of American Latinos categorized themselves as White. That dropped to 20% in 2020, but I think that's more of a temporary blip due to the divisiveness of the Trump years. People just don't \"see\" White Latinos because they don't stand out the way, say, Mexicans with an indigenous background stand out. Most look like Penelope Cruz or Antonio Banderas, both 100% Spanish.",

Poorer immigrants are able to migrate and incentivized to do so because of how close the US is, and the bad situations in many Latin American countries. So we often get more uneducated and poorer migrants than the migrants we get from Asia or Africa since they need money to successfully make it here more often than not. I’m skeptical about whether 50% of American Latinos are truly white, the majority are mixed. Especially since the majority come from Mexico and Central America, where the people have more indigenous ancestry. I still think they’re gonna assimilate because they’re still half European on average and cultural compatible with US Christian culture, but they aren’t European",

For example, if you saw Lin-Manuel Miranda walking down the street, you could easily assume he's Italian. You only notice the Latinos who look different (who are a minority).\n\nAlso, Latino immigrants are fairly educated, about a quarter of Latino immigrants have a college education. The poorer less educated ones arriving at the border are simply the most visible, but most immigration into the country arrive via airports (and most of the educated migrants come that way).\n\nFinally, I think being less educated/wealthy actually makes it more likely that they'll assimilate, not less, not necessarily in the first generation, but in the second generation. As a comparison, educated Chinese immigrant's children will tend to learn Chinese, and read significant amounts of it and travel more frequently to the home country. Less educated, less wealthy Chinese immigrants don't have the resources to do the same for their children, and so their children end up more assimilated. I think the same would be true for latino immigrants, especially as you pointed out due to the cultural similarity. Other then language, the culture of Mexico is not dramatically different from the USA.",

According to findings published in Nature Cities, the populations of some 15,000 cities around the country could dwindle to mere fractions of what they are now. The losses are projected to affect cities everywhere in the U.S. except Hawaii and Washington, D.C.\n\n“The way we’re planning now is all based on growth, but close to half the cities in the U.S. are depopulating,” says senior author Sybil Derrible, an urban engineer at the University of Illinois Chicago. “The takeaway is that we need to shift away from growth-based planning, which is going to require an enormous cultural shift in the planning and engineering of cities.”\n\nAlso from the article\n\nThe authors analyzed data collected from 2000 to 2020 by the U.S. Census and the American Community Survey, an annual demographics survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. This allowed them to identify current population trends in more than 24,000 cities and to model projections of future trends for nearly 32,000. They applied the projected trends to a commonly used set of five possible future climate scenarios called the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. These scenarios model how demographics, society and economics could change by 2100, depending on how much global warming the world experiences.\n\nPlease reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/198wc86/thousands_of_us_cities_could_become_virtual_ghost/ki9wyc0/",

It sucks to build on, especially for road, water, and sewage infrastructure. You can't farm on it. The only really productive things you can do with it are mining and sometimes forestry. Maybe with climate change Hudson Bay will turn out to be good for access to the ocean, but I wouldn't count on it.\n\nIn the west, the Rockies are sparsely populated for the same reasons they are in the USA.\n\nThe north sucks for reasons that should be immediately obvious, and climate change won't help that. Russia's north shares those same reasons with their 'vast tracts of nothing', and we can see how well that's working.\n\nThen we have the Interior Plains, the next best place for people to live. We can do agriculture there, though with different crops than the USA portions. One problem there is access to oceans for trade. Hudson Bay is undeveloped, and has that pesky Canadian Shield problem, and the St. Lawrence seaway only grants ocean access to the westernmost portions of Lake Superior. We don't have the same large rivers the US plains do. The other problem is the awful cold winters, which despite the overall warming of the planet, don't seem interested in abating in the near term.\n\nCanada has a treasure of fresh water, mineral wealth, forestry resources. But, good places to put huge numbers of people to live and work? Not so much. The places with increasing density in Canada, are really the only viable places to live, and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.",

The actual population growth is only 1.7%\n\nDo some reading on age demographics and you'll change your tune right quick. A huge chunk of Canadians are approaching aging out of the workforce. The boomers are fat and old. We do not have enough young blood to keep things going without bringing in productive people. We aren't shooting for old folks with immigration. It is targeting working age people and those people are net contributors to society.\n\nWhen you look at that demographic, you see the growing 65+ crowd and that is a problem. They are no longer income earners and drag down the rest of us. We need a healthy working population to sustain that.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Canada\n\nNotice the huge deficit around 20? We aren't going to solve that without bringing in fresh people. New 20 year olds take 20 years to exist.\n\nBesides, immigration is how we have always grown Canada. It's our thing.

All I see is concrete, glass, artificial lighting, huge apartment complexes, hundreds of miles of roads, and a couple of trees brought from somewhere with a truck. People are stuffed in containers and need to have literally everything brought to them with hundreds of energy slaves, while their own physiological potential is at best used to lift weights at the gym.\n\nIt all relies on a huge and complex system of supply and infrastructure, which demand huge amount of energy and effort to even maintain itself. In rural areas, there at least is a possibility to live in a sustainable manner. In urban areas, it's physically impossible.\n\nA sustainable city is just a myth, perpetuated by the single notion of supposedly lower emission per capita, completely ignoring the big picture where cities are these colossal machines of which growth is not tied to the carrying capacity of its environment, and rely on bringing in an ever increasing amount of the things these people need, from somewhere far away.\n\nI guess you could make cities more sustainable. No single housing, but entire families living under the same roof. Vastly less varied nutrition, requiring less international shipping. Less material goods and amenities. Less electricity and water supply per household. Less lighting everywhere, including apartments. Less organized garbage disposal. Less freedom of movement by limiting personal and public transport.\n\nBut who would like to live in a city like that? No one. Cities need to be unsustainable in order to be viable and attractive.\n\nAnd what comes to \"non-individualist\" and \"communal\" lifestyles in cities, they merely offer a surface-level illusion of them. Individuals come and go, whenever they graduate or find a job elsewhere or get a family. The only thing that ties them together are the circumstances and shared interests, in the sea of irrelevant and unknown masses all around.",

Do you feel like there need to just be less people, or do you think that the current population could be living differently and have less impact than they do in cities?\n\nFrom what you are saying I get the feeling that it is the former. Personally, I hope the world doesn't go down a path where we ever see that demographic shift.\n\nAbout community - it is really annoying that there is this migrant class of people in the who have to go wherever the jobs are. It's also frustrating that modern life makes it so that you don't need to depend on anyone else besides your employer to live your life, and communities are mostly based on mutual entertainment. I am part of that and I hate it. But I am still able to make so many more connections in the city than in the country. Everyone I would want to see was 40 minutes away. There are no places to meet people. You really mostly just have your family, so you have to hope you were dealt a good one. And yeah there are lots of people who will stick around in small towns and live their whole lives in one place, but there are many people who stay rooted to cities as well.

According to findings published in Nature Cities, the populations of some 15,000 cities around the country could dwindle to mere fractions of what they are now. The losses are projected to affect cities everywhere in the U.S. except Hawaii and Washington, D.C.\n\n“The way we’re planning now is all based on growth, but close to half the cities in the U.S. are depopulating,” says senior author Sybil Derrible, an urban engineer at the University of Illinois Chicago. “The takeaway is that we need to shift away from growth-based planning, which is going to require an enormous cultural shift in the planning and engineering of cities.”\n\nAlso from the article\n\nThe authors analyzed data collected from 2000 to 2020 by the U.S. Census and the American Community Survey, an annual demographics survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. This allowed them to identify current population trends in more than 24,000 cities and to model projections of future trends for nearly 32,000. They applied the projected trends to a commonly used set of five possible future climate scenarios called the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. These scenarios model how demographics, society and economics could change by 2100, depending on how much global warming the world experiences.",

Some businesses would close from a lack of customers, but if cities have less traffic, if there's better public transport, you might see more people from rural areas going into cities more regularly.\n\nAs it is though, this is like 80 years out, and they even say in the article \"if you had looked at Michigan 100 years ago, you probably would have thought that Detroit would be the largest city in the U.S. now\".

American investors are writing off trillions in plant and material in China and rebuilding a lot of it on-shore. This isn’t just in the US, following the war in Ukraine and china’s behavior around that, lots of countries are reassessing if they want inputs towards national or economic security to come in via China, never mind Russia.\n\nThe world is changing architecture. Where previously everything would be made in a single China based supply chain and distributed globally via US guarded shipping routes, the world is dividing into economic bubbles, where each bubble will have both rich countries that can pony up large scale demand, and countries that have low cost labor to carry the bulk of the manufacturing. The separation will not be hermetic of course, lots of stuff will still move between bubbles, it’ll just not be the volumes of today. The US and Mexico are one such bubble. Australia, Japan, South Korea, (maybe) Taiwan, together with Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines make up another. The Saudi Arabia/Israel/Turkey/maybe Egypt part of the Middle East is a third.\n\nEach bubble will largely need to pay for its own maritime security, and companies that make everything like Unilever and P&G will ultimately have independent factories in each bubble, not one for the entire world. You’ll find more in Europe, South America and maybe maybe Africa.\n\nWe’re already two years into this new architecture, and the trend-extrapolating prediction in this post doesn’t flow from the reality we’re in.",

Discovery is probably like 40-50m of that, and if the drug is not going to make its investment cost back, like it's for a rare disease, then nobody is prepared to drop the remaining 750m on it.\n\nGovernment might reclaim the parent but they will still need a ton more money or another investor who'll want rights to it if they want to do anything with it.\n\nIt's like when a movie studio buys the rights to a novel. They're not obliged to act on it and make a movie, and if anyone else wants to they'll have to stump up to buy the rights off the studio to take it further before they can even start.",

This was a quick check, I don't know if this high or low in general.\n\nSo yeah, even without the subsidy, insulin is about 5 times the price in the US.

So... idk what u are talking about in all honesty.\n\nDid u read a lot about cancer yourself???",

Of course as technology develops, and as mode of productions develop, there will be increases in science. but if certain structural economic features make it so that marginal growth and increase isn't necessary and can just be solved with one fell swoop, then that's preferable. for example in the capitalism argument they say it solves poverty marginally every year, but if we just planned the economy differently, there would be no poverty at all. So you can see how framing is pretty big here. Technology and to a lesser extent MAYBE capitalism can explain better medical results, but capitalism can also explain the suppression of \"insta cures\" by these same economic incentives. Again, if there was a cure for it, it would not be good for profit. Overall your main error is associating medical institutions and/or economic systems with genuine intent to help humans, when other structural motives exist to preclude the human need. Same with firms, there's a structural motive to decrease wage, in order to make profit. So in my opinion, true scientific inquiry can only really be met via a removal of economic success just being seen through \"muh quarterly revenues\" and \"how many people i can keep on pills and chemo until they inevitably die in debt\".",

I’m 100% in agreement with the fact that it’s tons of independent people acting in their own self interest as opposed to some large organized group.\n\nBut to nit pick, it’s pretty much always in their best interest to fuck us. This is legitimately just how capitalism works. If you can get more money for something you’re going to do it. If a couple people die because they can’t afford insulin, they still make more money by charging more. These are real people making real decisions. They are aware of the impacts their decisions have, they are aware of the consequences, they are aware that they are pricing people out of the ability to live. It’s not some conspiracy, like I said I agree with you there, but it’s still fucked up.\n\nThe incentives almost never align. Proponents of capitalism always say the market forces will correct these misaligned incentives but in reality they nearly never do. It doesn’t matter how fucked up the decision and its consequences are, most companies will pursue most avenues they can to make more money. They assess these risks often, and again the decisions are rarely in favor of comfort, quality of life, or lives themselves.\n\nAnd I’m not even staunchly anti-capitalist. Capitalism can be a pretty great system when it’s reigned in. But you can’t look at the decisions some of these companies make and say that fucking us is counter to their interests. Their interests is money at any nearly cost.\n\nBoeing is trying to force their planes through without meeting FAA safety criteria. Pilots can’t use the de-icing features on some of their newer planes. Panels are popping off of their fuselages mid-flight. There are ways to mitigate these kinds of issues, but they aren’t mitigating because mitigating costs more money and the dollar is king.\n\nYou can say the alternative is not having an airline industry, or the jobs leaving to another country, or this excuse or that excuse. So now our economy is being held hostage for the ability to risk actual human lives instead of implementing safety features. It’s bullshit.\n\nSo in the end, yes, they’re trying to fuck us. They nearly always are. That is the incentive in a capitalist system. Make money, make more of it, make it faster.",

Promising medications start off pre-suppressed.\n\nIn some cases they are suppressed by regulation that says a drug has to go through crazy expensive trials before it can be approved. In other cases, they are suppressed simply by the burden of proof: even without the government, doctors aren’t going to prescribe something they don’t know is safe and effective, and they’re not going to know it’s safe and effective without studies, which as I may have mentioned are crazy expensive. In still other cases, the medications are suppressed by medical conservativism: most doctors very reasonably don’t want to use a drug unless they know other doctors they respect are using the drug, so unless the drug impresses itself onto the consciousness of the entire medical community at once it will fizzle out.\n\nWhat drug companies do, as best I understand it, is put billions of dollars and millions of man-hours of effort into un-suppressing those particular drugs it is in their financial interest to un-suppress. They are doing a great service. It’s just a very selective one.",

This is 99% of the times because not enough people will buy it at the price needed to go positive and since a very rough estimation can be made in advance they just aren't researched, basically any orphan disease (stuff that is too rare or only common in extremely poor countries). Any cure for something serious enough that already has a treatment would make them a fortune + investors would rain and throw money at them, the whole \"duh they only want to sell treatments so they hide a cure\" makes absolutely no sense from an economical point of view (which is the only point of view that administration boards of literally any company take into account).\n\nOther times treatments are developed and produced, but keeping up the production and distribution isn't as profitable as ditching it entirely, so they usually sell the patent (or simply stop paying for it and not care about that anymore, because trust me it's unbelievably expensive to keep a patent going). So, for the same reason, they just move on and use the plants for something else.\n\nIt also doesn't make much sense saying \"the pharmaceutical companIES\", since one cannot just say \"nope, you're not doing research on that\" to the others and any time a better med is discovered that's another advantage over them and happy investors and all the usual things that apply to any company. Weaker competition means higher market share.\n\nTL;DR I have no specific examples, just the general rule that no company can magically masks the competition not sell a product, they benefit from selling an improved treatment (and even more from selling a cure to something that is only treated) and many times products are abandoned and topics not researched on because in general focusing on that would make them lose money.",

So either you're biting your own tail or you are dumping the costs of research exclusively on the end users, which is socially undesirable and also probably not economically correct.\n\nSo at the end of the day it is worth asking if we really are saving money and actually benefiting people more with this scheme, especially knowing that research is a bad free market due to positive externalities, that our current method to account for those, being patents, is full of abuse, and that simply subsidizing corporations to account for externalities is also notoriously full of abuse.",

Most people in the government are average-to-good at achieving the goals they were hired for.\n\nThe typical sources of the incompetence meme are:\n\nFirst and probably most fundamentally: the average person at the average job is not a paragon of competence and efficiency. They're mediocre. They perform at the median. But \"expectations\" are typically a fair bit higher than the median. Nothing about this is unique to government, but when applied to governments, it becomes a meme. Amusingly, pretty much every industry has its own memes about this, if you look more closely. Call center workers are incompetent. Managers are incompetent. Fast food workers are incompetent. Teachers are incompetent. Delivery people are incompetent. If everyone is incompetent, then it seems that's not \"incompetence\" that's just \"being a normal person\". But for psychological reasons, each of these memes persists independently and simultaneously with the others, without getting connected and \"resolved\" into a consistent worldview.\n\nSecond, it is not uncommon for people from the outside to misunderstand or be misaligned with the actual purpose of a job. Again, not exclusive to government, but comes up often in government. A DMV worker, to take a \"classic\" example, is not hired to make lines go as fast as possible; that is not the primary purpose of their job.\n\nNotably, there is a specific subset of government that is extremely misaligned with external expectations on a regular basis - \"politicians\", that is, the top of the legislative and executive branches. There, the issue is usually that the ones you think are \"incompetent\" are simply pursuing fundamentally different values from yourself.\n\nThird, and more specific to the modern US and US-influenced media, there is a built-in incentive for one of the major parties to actively propagate the \"government is incompetent\" meme, because they explicitly campaign on that basis.",

It's just a bunch of anecdotal evidence like \"I've heard\" or \"it totally makes sense (in my head) so it must be true!\".\n\n​\n\nTo answer your question OP, it is just a really, really stupid conspiracy theory. There is a mountain of evidence that it is bullshit but people like clinging to their conspiracy theories because it gives them comfort. When someone gets diagnosed with an untreatable disease they can blame it on some company. It wasn't just bad luck or poor live chose decisions that gave them or their loved ones a disease, it's some companys' fault they aren't healthy.\n\n​\n\nIf you want some evidence that suggests the opposite of these conspiracy theories then look at:\n\nThe national vaccination programs in various countries. We have basically eradicated several major diseases. What used to be a major threat like diphteria is basically gone, and as a result people don't think about it. The things we do cure end up being forgotten, so it gives the illusion of no progress because we only see the ones we haven't cured yet.\nThere are plenty of super-rich and powerful people who have died in various diseases we don't have a cure for, including people working at medical companies. Imagine thinking that someone would rather die or have their child die, than to cure a disease because... money?\nIt is a very US-centric view of the world. In a lot of countries, it is in the best interest (even financially) to keep people healthy. Our doctors in Sweden don't benefit from people being sick. Their paycheck is not determined by how many people they cure. In fact, their employer loses money whenever someone gets sick.\n\n​\n\nAs soon as something goes even slightly wrong in the healthcare sector, people are extremely quick to blame doctors and such for doing things wrong. Yet when safety precautions are put in place people say they are just letting people die or they don't get treated seriously.\n\nIt's very easy to come up with reasons for why your belief is correct, and people who believe in conspiracy theories generally only look for evidence that supports their beliefs and never question or look for evidence that contradicts them.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nEdit:\n\nBy the way, the NIH website currently lists 19,727 different clinical trials that are gearing up to accept test subjects. There are another 65,793 different trials looking for participants to test various medical treatments. It is absolutely insane to think that we are spending all this time and effort to finding cures, vaccines and treatment, and that somehow a multi-national conspiracy is taking place to not release a potential cure if it's found.\n\nIs it really so hard to believe that medicine is an incredibly complex thing and even though we spend trillions upob trillions of dollars on it, it still takes a lot of time, effort and sometimes luck to find solutions? And that we need to be extremely careful as well because failures could have horrible consequences that sets us back many many years. Just look at how anti-vaxxers have spread in the last decade, mostly based on a single bad study.",

        "comment": "Professional Neuroscientist, my work focuses on neurodegenerative diseases. What I have learned as a researcher is: drug approvals are a predilection to the masses. There in lies the rub.\n\nIf you are tasked with making a drug, plan on getting it approved, then your goal is to identify a home-run target or something that targets a very specific variant. Everything is a numbers game and time and disease complexity are variables that do not benefit drug manufacturers.\n\nTo this point, drug approval requires testing, one needs to readily be able to get a sufficient number of individuals/ a good model to even justify making a treatment.\n\nIf all dollars are equal, as a company making a drug, I either need to guarantee success or cast a real wide net to get a good risk-to-reward. Ultimately, the goal is to optimize the likelihood for success and therefore, I need to make sure my work is profitable. Now consider that government backed research has been basically stagnant for 30+ years and half of the US doesn’t trust that scientists are doing things for the greater good (See the Covid vaccine; the fastest, best vaccine to fix an immediate threat, and met with half the population saying they know better than the scientists that have dedicated their lives to help people with their research). So private companies dictate what gets fixed because they need to stay in business.\n\nUnfortunately, certain diseases/disorders, such as neurodegenerative disorders, require a really long timeline to generate proof of concept for a medication. Individuals diagnosed with the disease have also largely already started to succumb to neurodegeneration and thus, drugs are stuck being developed to treat a disease at a time of diagnosis after substantial disease onset. These medications may or may not treat the underlying disease and instead the observed symptoms. However, it may also already be too late. Individuals who display Parkinson’s disease symptoms have already lost a substantial portions of their brain that regulate movement and the underlying disease as an example. Thus it’s hard to design a drug to treat a disease when it cannot be diagnosed early enough to actually treat the underlying symptoms.\n\nSo, what this means is, assuming altruism, a company might scrap a potential treatment that could work in a portion of individuals because: 1) They cannot get the treatment to work in a majority of those tested, even if it works for a specific set of the population 2) They cannot create a reliable model to test a drug, even if they have evidence of it working in humans 3) the company cannot turn a profit. This means studies too long timelines are highly unlikely to happen because of the cost to run them. IE why test drug X over 10 years if I could get drug Y approved after a 1.5 year long study. 4) the drug doesn’t sufficiently treat a disease relative to when the disease is diagnosed.\n\nThe silver lining is that personalized medicine might fix this problem moving forward. Why give you an approved drug for the masses, if I can sample your fibroblasts, turn them into neurons, and screen a library of drugs to identify a specific treatment. It’s not that far off, we can already reprogram cells, but the cost is prohibitive.\n\nFor better or worse the drug approval process over scrutinizes drug candidates. The outcome is high quality treatments for approved drugs but also a subset of drugs that might otherwise be beneficial to a subsection of individuals left on the chopping block.",

I don't think anyone is really holding back a cure they already spent R&D on short of lawsuits and patent conflicts. They are price gauging and maybe not funding the best R&D. You'll find many stories of bright people with good ideas who can't seem to secure funding. There's also some funny business with them influencing third party companies that are supposed to test the efficacy of their drugs. Also funding to influence politics, or get around situations caused by negligence like what happened with pain meds and the opioid epidemic.

Usually hospitals with high pedigrees mobilize experimental treatments and after proven success the treatments will trickle down slowly to other places to be used more frequently. That doesn't mean it isn't still experimental. Data has to be collected over thousands of cases and then the data has to be sifted through to prove efficacy in the scheme of all of the other treatments and biological factors an individual has. Cancer is more complex than simply 'eat this vitamin' or 'take this cbd'. While the system of the FDA and for profit pharma effect what ideas rise to the top, the goal is ultimately to cure the disease and prolong life. Any contrariot can simply use this as an example, the longer you are alive, the more medicine you will buy, and the more profit they will make 🤷🏻‍♂️.

This leads to spending R&D money on nice-to-have drugs instead of life altering medicines more often than not. But it’s not a conspiracy, it’s just how things respond to the environment they exist in.",

It sidesteps the need for expensive infrastructure.\n\nThe continent's energy requirements are expected to increase considerably in the coming decades.\n\nAn additional investment of $30 billion a year is required.

There already were landlines and telephones. But nowhere near as much as what had been built in the developed world.\n\nI live in Zambia and I can tell you the main source of electricity here is hydroelectric power. But the process of electrification is ongoing. There aren't any gas-fired or nuclear plants.\n\nSo if/when solar is cheaper than coal (or hydroelectric) new customers might be getting their electricity from a brand new solar plant.",

You are artificially lowering supply, because you won't buy from carbon intensive sources. As a result, the price will invariably be higher than a non-green package.",
