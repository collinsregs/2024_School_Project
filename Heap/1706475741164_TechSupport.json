Drivers are software components that interact with hardware, disk drives are hardware components that store your operating system, applications, data, etc. SMART is Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology, a feature of modern disks that warns of impending failure. The most common configuration is a single drive, but multiple drives are also possible. Drives may be either mechanical (spinning disks) or solid state (SSD). SSDs are much faster than spinning disks, but cost more per byte of storage. Generally, replacing a disk is a simple operation, but then you need to install the operating system, drivers and applications which is not trivial given that you say you \"have barely any knowledge...\" It's hard to say much more without knowing what hardware you have.\n\nRepair vs. replace is always a question when a computer fails. First question would be whether the PC is old and under powered or new and powerful. Cost vs. time is the next consideration. Labor cost would probably be higher than parts cost for this repair.\n\nI'm assuming you are running Windows, but what version? Version 10 is going out of support October 14, 2025, and older hardware may not support version 11. I wouldn't yet recommend replacing working hardware that doesn't support Win/11, but broken hardware is another question.",

Dump files are crash logs from BSODs.\n\nIf you can get into Windows normally or through Safe Mode could you check C:\\Windows\\Minidump for any dump files? If you have any dump files, copy the folder to the desktop, zip the folder and upload it. If you don't have any zip software installed, right click on the folder and select Send to → Compressed (Zipped) folder.\n\nUpload to any easy to use file sharing site. Reddit keeps blacklisting file hosts so find something that works, currently catbox.moe or mediafire.com seems to be working.\n\nWe like to have multiple dump files to work with so if you only have one dump file, none or not a folder at all, upload the ones you have and then follow this guide to change the dump type to Small Memory Dump.

You can get a used Hp ProDesk 600 G5 for around 300 bucks its a desktop so you will also need a display, but it will run Window 11 any generation 9 or newer intel processor will run windows 11. I picked up one as my daily pc. By no means will it run any graphic intense games out of the box, but you can increase the memory and put in a video card. I picked up the SFF one and you have to use a low-profile video card and you can get a RTX2000 small form factor card for it. I am running also 24 gigs of memory. I can play Skyrim and MechWarrior 5 with no issues on this box. My cost to set up this pc was under 500. You may even be able to find a used windows 11 laptop for cheap by the time windows 10 is retired. I still have 3 desktops that my kids use running windows 10 but I am not worried. I ran XP for a few years after support for it was retired and Windows 7 as well. Follow good safety procedures and usually you won't be a victim. One of the first things I do I only use the pc with a non admin account. I create a dedicated administrator account for installing and troubleshooting I use the pc with a standard account. I put strong passwords on all accounts. Minimum password length should be no less then 10 but 12 or 14 characters is better. And have a mixture of lower-case, Upper-case letter's numbers and symbols. A 14-character password with a mixture of letters numbers and symbols will take years to crack. Hackers are looking for easy targets. You can always get a cheap Chromebook and use Office online.",

        "comment": "As someone who has supported numerous VPN connections over the years this can often be down to your ISP. There are several different protocols that different VPN software uses to connect. Some ISPs will block certain protocols, and if they are blocking the one you try to connect with it will fail. This would also fit with being able to connect via a different ISP (your cellular)\n\nIf you go into NordVPn and access settings > connection, you can adjust the protocol used. I'd suggest trying each of the protocols to see if any work over your ethernet connection. Failing that you might need to call your ISP, explain that your VPN traffic is being blocked and often the ISP will enable something at their end to allow that protocol over your connection.",

They will also have quite sophisticated management hardware for temperatures, voltages etc.\n\nThere are a few reasons why fans in a sever might be unbearably loud:\n\nOne or more fans is broken/missing so the others are compensating\nThe first reaction of most servers when they detect a fault is \"fans to max\"\nThere is some unsupported hardware involved (PCI devices etc) which make the server go into warning mode\n\nAnother issue is that unlike consumer devices, servers often have no dedicated CPU fans and instead rely on significant airflow through the entire case. This is amplified in smaller (1u) cases by having tiny ~40mm fans which whine like mad.",

This will let you get your files off the machine either be uploading them to the cloud or transferring them to your external drive. You use your second computer to make this media. You can use this OS like you'd use Windows as it provides a user-friendly graphical interface.\n\nIf the drive of interest isn't soldered to the board in your ASUS you can just remove it and place it in a working machine or purchase a SSD enclosure and plug the enclosure into a USB port on your working machine.",

That doesn't mean prior to that anyone had access to your machine.\n\nIts possible that whatever you ran could have harvested some data, but equally it might just be a straight up 'look here, send us money' script which looks bad, but is really just a crappy advert.\n\nHowever perfect paranoia says its possible data might have been harvested, so as others have said:\n\nReset your passwords, use unique whenever possible\n\nImplement MFA\n\nIf you have active accounts like Outlook you might want to log into those cloud services. There is usually an option to sign you out of all active sessions. Worth doing, check key sites like banking and make sure they look ok\n\nRun anti-virus scans on your system (windows defender, maybe something like MalwareBytes)",

You'd need something like a Roku or other box to decode the data stream and output a video signal appropriate for your projector.\n\nProjectors need a brilliant light source, and that often means at least a little heat and fan noise, but often a lot of heat and fan noise.\n\nSetting all that aside, without a proper screen and light control, a projector won't live up to a TV for picture quality, people walking in front of it block the image, and it will need to have the proper throw and lens to achieve the picture size in focus for your room. It also has to be positioned in a way that keystoning can be corrected and doesn't cause the picture to be noticable brighter on the nearer side of the image. This means some research to find the lens and project that works in your application. They're not all alike.",

This is ICS (internet connection sharing).\n\nEssentially your linux machine gets its internet connection and uses your router as its gateway. The linux machine then shares that connection to the rest of your network. Usually it does so by creating a new 'private' network, and the Linux box would get an additional IP on that network, so your linux box would exist on both your home LAN (the router) and a private network simultaneously. Any machine using that shared connection would have their gateway set to this Linux additional IP.\n\nTraffic goes from the windows box to the linux private network. The linux box then routes the traffic to your normal home LAN and directs traffic out via your router. All outgoing connections from your windows box are logged on the the linux machine, so when traffic returns from the internet the linux box can determine whether they are local (returning traffic for itself), or traffic for the shared network. In the second case it uses its own internal routing to get the traffic to the right host on the private network.",

It pretty much is apart of my other question about unplugging all other peripheral devices (other then mouse and keyboard). I've seen a lot of BSODs being caused by drivers, especially network drivers/devices being a main cause.\n\nFeel free to follow up if the BSODs consist.

That could be the issue if the crashes are seemingly random but im not sure why the BSOD issue would have started happening to you 3 weeks ago unless you got new RAM around then?\n\nAlso wouldnt hurt to reseat your RAM/only have one stick in at a time in different slots to see if it helps.\n\nTry to brainstorm anything that you have replaced, adjusted, and updated around that time frame if you can think of anything.",

In the general section where Windows puts what it thinks went wrong, there is nothing there of value. No suspects. Because these are minidumps, Windows tries to shave off as much data as possible to bring the size down which means that all the DPC queues for other cores are empty. You can think of DPC as the CPU's time schedule. Drivers and processes \"book time\" at certain priorities and wait for execution.\n\nWithout seeing the other DPC queues it's a lot harder, the only other active driver I see is the network driver, but it's a real shot in the dark with this little information.",

Assume above is false, your mobo is more than likely supporting dual channel ram configuration, which increases memory's performance. 3rd stick won't be part of this configuration and therefore will have worse performance. This means whenever your system will utilize that 3rd stick it will do so at lower rate, marginally impeding performance.\n\nConsiderations for gaming: Dual channel benefit in gaming is negligent. Benefit of 48GB for gaming is even worse as most games (if any) won't come even close to utilizing it.\n\nIn summary, unless your need for 48GB RAM out-weights need for speed then by all means go ahead and do it.

Basically could be FN+ f5 or f7 or f8. Should have a little antenna symbol or plane symbol for airplane mode. Alternatively, there should be a sticker on the bottom of the laptop(or etching) with a model number.

If something's wrong with the RAM and it can't initialize the RAM then the BIOS may try to solve things by power cycling the machine in hopes it will come up correctly the next time it's powered on.\n\nIf your Windows isn't booting with the RAID storage driver for some reason then you can try setting it to boot in safe mode and then turn RAID back on. When you start in safe mode Windows will try multiple boot storage device driver and that can solve this. After your system boots in RAID mode you can turn safe mode off again, it will store the working storage device driver for subsequent booting.",

Closing the lid disables the built-in display, letting the laptop only need to worry about sync-ing game framerates to the external display.\n\nhttps://www.pcguide.com/monitor/how-to/fix-screen-tearing/",
