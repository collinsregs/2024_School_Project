In fact it will be used to enhance the training set, the more difficult you make the training data the better the trained result.\n\nAlso as someone who works in the field trying to solve whatever issue the model has is way more interesting than just filtering images, and I'd bet other researchers think the same. So it's guaranteed that instead of a workaround ignoring images researchers would be pretty excited to try to tackle this problem head on.\n\nAnd IMO the actual usability of poisoning images is pretty dubious. It's very model specific, and it relies on our current misunderstanding of large dnns. Basically right now were in the baby hitting a toy hammer phase of these dnns, what we're doing with training is very inefficient and basically brute force, causing issues like the network being lazy and focusing on differences between pixels instead of the image as a whole. Eventually this problem will be solved. Heck it can probably be solved right now by just compressing the image a bit, but again that isn't an interesting solution. The fundamental problem is that dnns don't understand anything.",

They are the most vulnerable to a threat of making a deep fake public. They aren't mature enough to navigate through that kind of social nightmare and see through to the other side.\n\nAs an adult though, I couldnt care less if someone wanted to waste their time generating pictures of me doing whatever...

You would file a civil lawsuit for harassment or defamation? Cool cool, well that's not even a route for most revenge porn victims at the moment (something that actually is regulated to an extent, unlike AI porn), not to mention it's financially prohibitive for many others.\n\nYes, of course minors are a concern. So are other vulnerable people, probably the ones who aren't quite like you and are at bigger risk of being professionally or socially punished for sexual material being disseminated or falling into the wrong hands.\n\nThis is like the revenge porn discussion all over again. You are exactly like the people who used to argue that we really shouldn't do anything about it or craft any new legislation to create recourse for victims, because it might create slight inconveniences for people who consume lots of porn online lol.

When in all reality they‚Äôre noobs still.\n\nMore self starters are needed. Because when in fact many people with degrees can barely tie their shoes. Colleges are accepting more and more students that aren‚Äôt cut out for it. And frankly, plumbing, electrician, handyman, etc. can make great money with zero debt.\n\nI now after yrs of hiring experience prefer hiring from trade schools, ya know why? Those people have gumption. They don‚Äôt want to be great students, they want to be great workers.\n\nIt‚Äôs a huge catch-22. If you‚Äôre going to go into debt for college, at least pick the hardest degree possible. Comp Sci is just a liberal arts degree, electrical engineering is that same degree, but far more rigorous.",

The issue is that colleges are earning money by educating students in degree fields without promise. As for you - Finish your degree in underwater basket weaving, find a job, any job, pay off your student debts before literally everything else and all the while focus on growing your future career, which most likely will have nothing to do with your first job.\n\nMany of my best programmers that have led teams at Amazon, Google and Facebook were not comp sci majors, but math majors. They picked a hard degree and then decided they enjoyed programming.\n\nDon‚Äôt sweat it, there‚Äôs tons of money out there to be made, you‚Äôre going to do great, but remember you have to reach out and grab it.

Meta thinks effectively that everything available on the internet falls under \"fair use,\" because AI models like Llama do not exploit or reproduce copyrighted works.

An Ars representative said the photo, showing a pizza and captioned ‚ÄúI love pizza,‚Äù was removed by Ars staff on December 16 after being tipped off by email from an unknown party.\n\n‚Ä¢ The Ars profile used an embedded URL that pointed to the image, which was automatically populated into the about page.\n\n‚Ä¢ Buried in that URL was a string of characters that appeared to be random‚Äîbut were actually a payload.\n\n‚Ä¢ The campaign also targeted the video-sharing site Vimeo, where a benign video was uploaded and a malicious string was included in the video description. The string was generated using a technique known as Base 64 encoding.\n\n‚Ä¢ The campaign came from a threat actor Mandiant tracks as UNC4990, which has been active since at least 2020 and bears the hallmarks of being motivated by financial gain.",

I wrote an amicus brief to her in the Twitter merger case explaining that Musk was abusing her court to fix litigation and evade his accountability to both the FTC, as well as a case called John Doe v. Twitter which was a CSAM case. I also went to Wilmington the night before the first hearing in the Twitter case and tagged up messages around her courthouse and all through the city protesting the deal.\n\nThe judge apparently used my argument to convince the \"sides\" they had to conclude their business without abusing her court. She does not like fixed litigation because the Court of Chancery is extremely prestigious and costly (about $15k/day just for the judge and court resources). The FTC confirmed to me an acknowledgment that my letter to them was entered into their database which is used by international law enforcement agencies to help stop CSAM & phishing on social media.\n\nI helped convince some bankers to back out of the Twitter deal which forced Musk to pay more money into it which partially came from this Tesla compensation package, pushed advertisers to pull out, and organized employee walkouts which Musk blamed on a \"ghost employee.\" This enabled the FTC and international law enforcement agencies to investigate the company.\n\nIt's good to see this story come full circle and have the honorable Judge McCormick provide the necessary smack down on the world's \"richest man,\" to bring justice.",

For example, I'm in Oregon and I have to pay $50 to incorporate in Oregon to the Secretary of State every 2 years.\n\nThe reason companies choose Delaware is primarily because it allows you to create a business where the owners are not known. Meanwhile here in Oregon if you look up my name in the Secretary of State's systems you can find every business where I'm an official officer.\n\nBecause Delaware makes it possible to keep anonymous, it's popular for shell businesses or other owners that want their privacy respected.\n\nI can attest first hand that keeping this information in the public record sucks - any time you file a new business you get a new wave of junk mail and the occasional attempt at a fraudster stealing your identity. For this reason, in a place like Oregon (and many other states) people will hire a lawyer to do this paperwork and maintain the incorporation, keeping the owner's name out of public records. This often costs at least $500.\n\nThe real money local governments make is on sales taxes and income taxes. The income tax is paid wherever you have employees living and doing work.",

Shareholders elected them so that is what the company wants right?¬† Fiduciary Duty is a duty that someone as by law if they accept a position of trust over some financial entity. That is they have promised to do something for a beneficiary of a trust. In this case, the board of directors has a fiduciary duty to the share holders of the company. In this specific case it has to do with the board being good stewards of the assets of the company on behalf of the shareholders. Part of that would be challenging the CEO on their pay package to ensure that the money spent is worth it. A shareholder thought that the board breached it fiduciary duty to shareholders with Musk's pay package. The Court found the board didn't do their duty at all and essentially zero resistance was put up to the pay package. This is why his pay package was over turned despite the board approving it and the board being appointed by the share holders.\n\nIt would be like if Uncle Jimbob raided Nana's inheritance and someone said, but Nana made Jimbob the executor. How could that go against the deceaseds wishes if he was appointed by them? Well, Jimbob is in charge of a trust, the estate, and is expected to split up the estate via the best intentions of the deceased. There is a fiduciary duty there. This is why we have wills. To make that duty explicit. Boards likewise have that duty. It is likewise made explicit it law, and in the shareholder agreement.",

The best he's come up with so far is to remake a new version of Twitter, but that effort seems to have stalled out.",

Their fiscal year closes at the end of January instead of December (because retail & holidays). Every January, there was a \"purge\" of people that were let go in an end of the fiscal year RIF. This is so the books look great at year end & they can show the stockholders how THD is running lean. They look at everyone as just a line item on a spreadsheet & each department is given a number to hit, so they cut people based on their bottom line impact (salary, benefits, bonus, etc.). VPs make the cuts & then Directors have to make a case for someone they cannot afford to lose, but in the end, the VPs decisions will be final 95% of the time.\n\nHow do I know this? I was a product manager for an online program that I had taken over & was bringing in $18M in revenue a year. In 2 years, I had grown the program to over $75M in revenue, automated the process for running it, and was even put in charge of the largest online sales on Black Friday. Seems like I was on track for success, right?\n\nI was \"purged\" the January after THD had it's largest online revenues ever to date. I was expendable because I had made the process so automated, that they figured an analyst with 10 other things on their plate could run it instead of having a dedicated middle manager such as me.\n\nSo, I lost my job & I have since watched my old program wither into a shell of what it used to be because it was about more than just the process of generating sales. There was finesse that went into it. But I guess my meager salary was too much for a program that was generating $75M a year in revenue.",

Contrary to the belief that RTO boosts company value, the analysis revealed that RTO mandates are more likely in firms with poor recent stock performance and have had no significant impacts on firm profitability or stock-returns. Moreover, a notable drop in employee job satisfaction was observed, further questioning the efficacy of these mandates.",

Even when owned the math is far more complicated then \"butts in seats is savings\" or something. Here and there it's probably a contributing factor but real estate is not driving RTO.\n\nMy personal observation and thinking is companies push RTO because upper management are generally self-selecting extroverts who are energized by in person contact and already have flexibility in their work life by virtue of their position. Charismatic extroverts please \"up\", and work their way to upper management at a higher rate then introverts. They're therefore the group most miserable with mandatory WFH - they've gained nothing and they've lost their social environment. The ones who go by \"gut\" project their own social demands upon the rest of the company, truly believing that everyone will also benefit and work better with constant social contact the way they feel they do.\n\nThere's reason to think that ADHD prevalence may be higher among executives, and I say from personal experience as someone with ADHD that just being at work does provide some help with focus, because you're visible and there are less non-work distractions (of course there are distractions - your coworkers, but office cooler talk is not seen as a negative by them). Some of these executives may personally be struggling when WFH with attention, and again project that onto their entire organization - \"I work better in the office therefore you all must also work better in the office\".\n\nUnrelated, I'm reading this study and it seems flawed to me, though parts I only skimmed. They start by giving three possible motivations for RTO mandates of their own creation, then seem to assume those are the only possible motivations. They don't seem to have any evidence backing this assumption up that those three reasons are the only reasons. Then they take the empirical fact that RTO mandates don't increase company value and state therefore management must not be mandating RTO because they think it will increase value. Problem is humans are not rational actors with 100% perfect knowledge, but they don't, as far as I can find, show any evidence that knowledge of RTO effectiveness in increasing company value was widely known by management over the past three years. Just because it's not going to work doesn't mean someone won't try it anyway expecting it to work, for any variety of reasons.",

Usually you want some kind of analysis before layoffs to make sure you don't let go of key people and the highest performers. Doing a blanket \"come back to the office or else\" is a very blunt tool that's going to risk a lot of your highest performing employees jumping ship, as they are also most likely better positioned to find another job quickly.",

I had a person I had worked with in the past I wanted to refer, but he would need to be remote. We interviewed him in early September and my boss gave me the green light to move forward with him. HR dicked us around until December and had me spend about an hour a day checking our hiring portal to review, and interview candidates. Their reason being they \"needed more data\" to see if a remote employee was the way we needed to go.\n\nMy referral probably saved them 20 grand, HQ is in a very high cost of living area and my referral and I live in a very low cost. In reality what ended up coming to light is each year they have a self imposed \"remote employee allocation\" and they go above that they need approval from the c-suite. From what I heard they would have gotten it as soon as they asked cause CEO doesn't care, but HR is chicken shit. So they waited until Dec so the start date would be in the new year.\n\nIts just dumb that you were willing to lose a great candidate who has been plug and play due being a referral all because you want an ass to fill a chair.",

I was doing data integration under him, but had nothing to do with all the reports he was working. This was in IT, but at a manufacturing company.\n\nMy current company I'm a manager and am in the weeds every day. I'm moving away from some of the lesser things (integration errors, new customer implementations) now that I have a new hire and focusing in on larger system architecture and data base things. My boss is not in the nitty gritty generally, but he's capable if needed. He is doing his job to support our team so I dont have any issues. This is a CPG company, but on the IT side.\n\nI guess my point is that mileage may vary on how in the weeds your boss can get.",

They tend to promote people who network (read:suck up) with the boss instead of the people actually doing the work. I've always been a hard and very skilled worker, and watched the bosses buddy get promoted over me multiple times. At one point I was doing the supervisors job when we didn't have one, and they decided to promote someone from another department to the position. And it's not like I had a bad attitude or anything, the DoO just wouldn't let me be promoted because I was valuable where I was.",

Complex entities cannot work when 90% of the budget is for managers, administration, offices, and anything not immediately related to the actual job being provided.\n\nWith the way technology has advanced in the past two decades, I argue that most office jobs are useless and can be done by software now - most companies do not need a dedicated billing department anymore when a properly configured self-serve app will allow the customer or sales rep to enter all the necessary information for SAP to compile into accounting reports. Most companies can go entirely paperless, very few industries actually require formal written communications or notifications and those that do often allow e-forms in their place. And even for highly technical jobs requiring a dedicated workstation and equipment, like pipefitting, most of it can be done by a computer now although it requires the technician to be both literate and a tolerable programmer .. which most companies won't make the investment in. In my opinion, all of this is due to a skills gap - business management colleges don't teach anything about technology, and laborers aren't expected to work with anything but their hands. The intense specialization compartmentalizes knowledge and prevents optimal business strategies from being considered.",

These metamaterials typically feature lightweight, complex patterns such as lattice or minimal surface structures. Conventional tools for investigating these microscale structures, such as scanning electron microscopy, cannot easily probe the internal features of these structures, which are critical for a comprehensive assessment of their mechanical behavior. In turn, we demonstrate an optical confocal microscopy-based approach that allows for high-resolution optical imaging of internal deformations and fracture processes in microscale metamaterials under mechanical load. We validate this technique by investigating an exemplary metamaterial lattice structure of 80 √ó 80 √ó 80 Œºm3 in size. This technique can be extended to other metamaterial systems and holds significant promise to enhance our understanding of their real-world performance under loading conditions.",

        "comment": "Some of the major issues highlighted by the author:\n\nI‚Äôm pretty sure Apple does not want to be known for creating the ultimate surveillance machine. But to make magical things happen inside its goggles, apps need loads of information about what‚Äôs happening to the user and around them. Apple has done more than rivals like Meta to limit access to some of this data, but developers are going to keep pressing for more.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a tension between having these types of experiences and your privacy,‚Äù says Jarrett Webb, technology director at design firm Argo, who has been exploring developing for the Vision Pro. ‚ÄúIt has to get this data to get an understanding of the world to invoke these experiences.‚Äù\n\nAnd once developers have data, it‚Äôs hard to ensure they don‚Äôt also use it for purposes that might feel like a violation.\n\nOn some issues, Apple has drawn a line in the sand ‚Äî at least initially. To combat people being surreptitiously filmed with the Vision Pro, there‚Äôs an indicator on the device‚Äôs front screen when it's shooting a photo or video. Apple also isn‚Äôt allowing third-party Vision Pro apps to access the camera to capture photos and videos. That would, in theory, also prevent third-party apps from doing creepy things like running facial recognition algorithms on people while you‚Äôre looking at them.\n\nBut privacy researchers tell me photographs alone aren‚Äôt the biggest concern here. We have, since the days of Google Glass, come to terms with the idea a smartphone could be filming us at any time.\n\nThe new problem is what else the device is gathering: a map of the spaces around you. The device needs to know the contours of the world around you so it can know where to insert digital things into your line of sight.\n\nUnderstanding what‚Äôs in the room around you can be even more invasive than having a photograph of it, says Joseph Jerome, a visiting professor at the University of Tampa and the former policy lead on sensor data at Meta‚Äôs Reality Labs.\n\nVision Pro apps have the ability to access this data, if a user grants permission ‚Äî like how an iPhone app asks for your location. These worldview maps might just look like a wireframe mesh to a human, but to a computer it reveals a lot.\n\nOn a basic level, the Vision Pro might know it‚Äôs in a room with four walls and a 12-foot ceiling and window ‚Äî so far, so good, Jerome says. But then add in that you‚Äôve got a 75-inch television, suggesting you might have more money to spend than someone with a 42-inch set. Since the device can understand objects, it could also detect if you‚Äôve got a crib or a wheelchair or even drug paraphernalia, he says.\n\nAdvertisers and data brokers who build profiles of consumers would salivate at the chance to get this data. Governments, too.\n\n...\n\nInformation about how you‚Äôre moving and what you‚Äôre looking at ‚Äúcan give significant insights not only to the person‚Äôs unique identification, but also their emotions, their characteristics, their behaviors and their desires in a way that we have not been able to before,‚Äù says Jameson Spivak, a senior policy analyst at the Future of Privacy Forum.\n\nApple has addressed the privacy around one extra-sensitive organ: your eyeballs. The Vision Pro tracks your eyes so you can select things with your gaze like you might move a mouse on a computer. But Apple says it doesn‚Äôt share where users look with apps, websites or even itself. Instead, the device only reports what you‚Äôve selected with your gaze after you tap your fingers together, the Vision Pro equivalent of a mouse click.\n\nThis is a solid place to start. But what about the rest of the body? Developers tell me apps can get access to a stream of data about users‚Äô movement, right down to the wiggle of a finger.\n\n...\n\nMixed-reality devices are ‚Äúvery exciting with huge potential,‚Äù says Berkeley computer science Professor James O‚ÄôBrien. ‚ÄúBut I also think that privacy considerations need to be primary design criteria, not afterthought.‚Äù\n\nThese are some important considerations that need to be made, especially as AR/VR devices become more commonplace. There are a host of parameters that can be tracked with these devices, both of the user and their environments, and having proper privacy frameworks and policies in place will be increasingly important. Ideally policymakers will have been looking in depth at these issues already, but given their inability to understand or manage the privacy implications of other devices now being widely used/deployed, it's unlikely that this will be happening anytime soon without significant amounts of public pressure.",

Anyone trusting Jetbrains these days is an airhead and naive.\n\nJetBrains is essentially a Russian funded and run company even though it is based in the Czech Republic\n\nAs of 2019, the company has offices in Prague, Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Munich, Boston, Novosibirsk, Amsterdam, Foster City and Marlton, New Jersey\n\nMoscow office is now \"closed\" after the war started and sanctions hit. However they stayed in Russia for over a year after the war started and MOST developers were still in Russia up to then. It was the entry point for the biggest hack in military history with SolarWinds. It is now banned in most secure systems and should be looked at as potentially leveraged.\n\nRussian companies/oligarchs front lots of companies in seemingly less hostile but still leveraged places like Czech, Malta, Cyprus, Brazil, China etc and even Western ones that are layered. This is for plausible deniability. Many times they are good for decades and then activated with all that past data/intel.\n\nNo one would use it if it was based in Russia.\n\nI love JetBrains technology and they were once needed, not any longer and you can't trust telemetry from access to all your code and potential holes over to Eastern Europe (Russia).\n\nDev tools and CI are two of the biggest targets for cyber espionage and attacks nowadays, see SolarWinds which was partially through Jet Brains TeamCity...\n\nDevs are really, really naive to this whole situation as they are easily culted/marketed into platforms that are surveillance tech. JetBrains and other sketchy backed tech has heavy turfing and marketing pushes, more than many things almost because of the value of access to intel on what developers/companies are working on right now, sometimes months/years before market.\n\nEssentially JetBrians has been activated like Kaspersky was. If you don't trust Kaspersky, you probably shouldn't trust JetBrains. Doesn't matter if it is solid or simple tech, that is how they get you.\n\nUsing JetBrains is not good opsec at the current geopolitical state, unless you are trying to sell investments to BRICS countries and you want them to see.\n\nIt sucks because JetBrains is awesome tech, but it is too risky depending on what you are working on.\n\nSolarWinds Hack Investigation Now Points to JetBrains as a Possible Weak Link in the Cyber Kill Chain, New York Times Reports\n\nJetBrains TeamCity: Hacked by Russia to Hit SolarWinds, U.S. Government? - MSSP Alert\n\nSoftware Development Teams: Are You Using JetBrains‚Äô TeamCity?\n\nInvestigation Launched Into Role of JetBrains Product in SolarWinds Hack: Reports\n\nWidely Used Software Company May Be Entry Point for Huge U.S. Hacking Russian hackers may have piggybacked on a tool developed by JetBrains, which is based in the Czech Republic, to gain access to federal government and private sector systems in the United States\n\nSealed U.S. Court Records Exposed in SolarWinds Breach\n\nThe New York Times on Wednesday reported that investigators are examining whether a breach at another software provider ‚Äî JetBrains ‚Äî may have precipitated the attack on SolarWinds. The company, which was founded by three Russian engineers in the Czech Republic, makes a tool called TeamCity that helps developers test and manage software code. TeamCity is used by developers at 300,000 organizations, including SolarWinds and 79 of the Fortune 100 companies.\n\n‚ÄúOfficials are investigating whether the company, founded by three Russian engineers in the Czech Republic with research labs in Russia, was breached and used as a pathway for hackers to insert back doors into the software of an untold number of technology companies,‚Äù The Times said. ‚ÄúSecurity experts warn that the monthslong intrusion could be the biggest breach of United States networks in history.‚Äù\n\nUse at your own risk.

They force nomads to settle down for the sake of legibility. To a bureaucrat, order is what looks like order, grids, hexagons, and the like. They are far removed from actual realities of living, breathing, living life in the places that they manage.\n\nIt's not as if it's a new thing that living things have been reduced to an algorithm. A willow, which provides bark for medicine, whose branches provide thatching, whose fruits nourish the critters in the forest canopy, is completely reduced on a paper ledger to a single number, to mark the amount of wood available to the state of some Enlightenment era monarch.\n\nIn the US, John Oliver did a piece about people who the system thought were dead, also by same name mistaken identity. They had a hellish time trying to convince some stuck up bureaucrat that they were alive. It is a comedy that would put Kafka to shame, but no, that is reality.\n\nWhen Bee presented the evidence, the officials agreed there was an algorithmic error but said that her application could not be considered because her total family income exceeded the eligibility limit even though that was not the case.\n\nThis is not merely a question of a computer making mistakes. You can make mistakes with paper and pencil just fine. It is the fact that we believe the computer is infallible that causes us to go wrong. This is perhaps a question for sociologists or psychologists to examine, on the subject of human beings and authority. This is not merely a technology problem, but a bureaucracy problem, of officials that are unwilling to use common sense and do their jobs. And that, is a far harder problem to solve.",

Maybe the card to connect the PC to the equipment uses an ISA slot, maybe the software doesn't communicate properly with the hardware when run in an emulator, maybe there's something fucky with IRQ and COM port configuration, maybe if the CPU is too fast, it breaks something...\n\nObviously we want to use newer stuff (when a motherboard dies in a 30-40 year old desktop, it's a bitch and a half to deal with), but sometimes it's not feasible due to technology incompatibility.\n\nBeyond that, here are two more stories of upgrade failures:\n\nStory 1: Replacing all Win XP computers with Win 7. I wanna say this was in 2014, give or take a year. Win XP machines connect to manufacturing equipment. Cost per system to replace the desktops is $$$-$,$$$ per system, so $$$$ total. Easily doable as part of the greater effort to replace all the desktops at the site, which was $$,$$$. Well, the software that communicates with the manufacturing equipment didn't work on Win 7 in testing and the software vendor informed us we'd need to buy new software, which would cost $,$$$ per computer. However, that new software didn't work with our current manufacturing equipment so we'd need to get new manufacturing equipment, which was going to cost $$$,$$$ plus the $,$$$ it would cost us to dispose of the old equipment (or we could throw it in the back of a warehouse and forget about it, which was usually what they did with most things). The business opted to just keep those computers on XP, and segment them from the rest of the network.\n\nStory 2: Replacing two Win 7 PCs with Win 10. This was in 2019 into 2020. Similar story to above - Win 10 didn't work with the current software, new software that works with Win 10 didn't work with the current equipment, so they'd have to purchase two new PCs plus two new software licenses plus two new pieces of equipment. Total cost $$,$$$. They had the money and decided to spend it. When it came time to decomission the Win 7 equipment and old hardware, they then decided \"wait a minute, now we have 4 PCs that can [do the task] and 4 [equipment] so we can increase our throughput of [task] by double!\" and opted to run the Win 7 machines and Win 10 machines side by side.",

The two most common cases are DE-9 or DB-25 connections to some piece of equipment (manufacturing, inserting, imaging, milling... whatever process is being done). Most modern desktops don't have an onboard serial or parallel port to connect to those so you need to buy a PCI-E expansion card, which may or may not work, or you can buy a USB-serial adapter, which also may or may not work.\n\nAnother edit - Oh, that reminds me of the time I couldn't get something working and determined it was because the serial connection was some proprietary re-pinned version of a DE-9 serial port where I had to take it apart and rewire the thing and that actually got the device to communicate with the computer but then it was sending the data wrong and that was a whole 'nother thing...\n\nEdit - Oh, and if the software was written in 16-bit, you can probably get it working on a 32-bit OS but not on a 64-bit OS, so a 64 bit host OS running a virtualized 32 bit OS running 16 bit software is... well, \"fun\" isn't the word I'd use, that's for sure.\n\nIf it doesn't work, trying to figure out WHY it's not working is a pain and it's not uncommon for the effort to be fruitless. In each of these examples given above, I've -TRIED- to make this shit work and wasted many, many hours of my life playing with driver settings, adjusting COM port settings, etc.\n\nSometimes, the software won't recognize the equipment when it's run in a VM (I've had several software vendors flat out tell me \"the software doesn't work in a VM and has to be run on bare metal\" and sometimes I've gotten it working or kinda working that way in spite of that claim, but they won't support it or help you at all so it's very much a \"you're on your own\" kind of thing. (Edit: Assuming the software vendor still exists and hasn't either been acquired by someone who doesn't support it anymore or just flat out gone out of business 10-15 years ago)\n\nIf you go way WAY back to DOS and 3.1 and some 9x stuff, you get into situations like the one I mentioned above with needing an ISA card, which... I can't remember the last time off the top of my head I saw a NEW computer with an ISA port but I'm pretty sure the year started with a \"19...\" The DOS (Microsoft DOS, Data General RDOS, whatever it is) system connects to the equipment with these ribbon cables that I've never located anything even resembling \"modern hardware\" that I've gotten to work with them. Those things stay plugged into a UPS and exist on fumes and prayers. If they ever fail on us, I think the disaster recovery plan is to hand the board off to one of the electrical engineers and hope they can figure out what component of the board failed and repair it.",

I could've written up a 10 page essay on every design choice they made and why it was fucking dumb as rocks.\n\nThe whole thing was far, far slower to use and with the awful desk/seating they had combined with the forced, constant non-stop mouse usage, I developed got carpel tunnel pains within like 2-3 days and quit.

A spokesperson for the FBI and the Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen Western nations first warned about Volt Typhoon in May, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the hacking allegations were a \"collective disinformation campaign\" from the Five Eyes countries, a reference to the intelligence sharing grouping of countries made up of the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the UK.‚Äù",

The only one I can see is for gaming immersion.\n\nMicrosoft tried to say it would be better for 3d artists and modelers but they all disagree. Hands are not precise enough and there are too many manipulations that are done using data input that need to be precise. If you want to extrude something by 2cm, it's easier to do with a keyboard and mouse.\n\nYes, we could have a lot of real life information available through AR when we go out, but scan a qr code on things that actually interest you and that's better handled instead of being bombarded with info you cannot care about that is pushed on you more or less aggressiveley depending on how much money the company spent on advertising.",

Microsoft's HoloLens has already shown us that the segment is presently an irrelevant niche. AR will only be viable when they can be successfully integrated into something as inconspicuous as a pair of glasses so we still have a very long way to go.\n\nIn light of that all, there are far better options on the market with none of Apple's inherent limitations. Several other headsets feature quality OLEDs and several achieve much higher refresh rates, something I'd argue is more important than maximum resolution.\n\nPersonally, I'm most interested in is the Bigscreen Beyond. It has decent displays, but its most compelling aspect is being one of the most compact headsets on the market. On that front, the Vision Pro doesn't even come close.",

The issue is isn't immature technology it's the fact that VR itself doesn't revolutionize everyday life.

Then you'll need volumetric captures instead of standard 180/360 captures, so that you can move your body naturally inside the event rather than being locked in a straightjacket. Finally, this needs to be tied together with photorealistic avatars and realistic audio propagation so that you can have an audiovisual experience that is basically indistinguishable from the real thing, and one that is highly social thanks to the avatars.",

You won't need glasses while wearing the headset.\nCosts will come down like all tech\nSolved when AV become ubiquitous.\nEasily solved when tech matures and they have built in venting or other fog mitigating features. Also, most people don't use TV or monitors in unconditioned environments, so for just monitor replacement it is a non-issue.\nSolved when projection, refresh rate, and latency becomes in indistinguishable from real life. Also, not a huge problem when uses as monitor replacements.\n\nDespite monitors being just displaying flat 2D images, you usually use them in a 3D environment. For example you use your monitor in conjunction with you desk with whatever is on the desk.",

As someone who has never owned a Mac or Ipad it's next to useless for me compared to the Quest 3. I purchased a quest 3 which has most of the same features just miles behind. It has the hand tracking, voice recognition, mixed reality, and utility features present in the Vision pro. Albeit the hand tracking and mixed reality is absolute garbage. The display is also garbage compared to the vision pro's but still better than most TV's out of sheer necessity.\n\nWhat the quest 3 does have, is the ability to connect to my PC and laptop. Games that can be played on board. Actual controllers to use instead of hand tracking and a USB-C port to charge with whatever battery pack you want. Theoretically I can just hotswap batter packs all day. Although I did get a bobovr headset that includes a battery. Despite being miles behind in technical features the Quest 3 is miles ahead in actually useful features for most consumers.\n\nPerhaps if the Vision Pro can get games and apps that are present in other VR spaces it might be more useful but as it stands right now it is unlikely. Even youtube and most streamers are avoiding it currently. Not to mention, most early adopters for apple products are obnoxious AF just because they can be. I just have no interest in dealing with them. I agree with others when I say I look forward to the Vision Pro a couple of versions now when it's just overpriced and not obnoxiously unaffordable.\n\nI do look forward to seeing what other industry leaders create in response to this. 200,000 units sold at $3,500.00 or more is an attractive number regardless of what the margin is.",

And have fabric bands will stay clean for 2-3 months until it starts to get quite dirty. I'm not sure you would like to have a dirty band for 2-3 years at the office.¬†\n\nWell, it's going to be exactly like the 3d tv. Not enough content, not user friendly enough (a family of 4 that want to do a movie night in VR/AR in the same house is looking at 14000$ USD of equipment, lol). So, I understand this is a \"concept\" product, there's no way it will be other than niche for the next decade at least. VR headsets are still very niche at 500$ and I own one and nobody in the house is really interested to use it. I've put maybe 200hr combined in the past 3 years.

Time doesn't actually make technology progress by itself, it's investment over time that causes advancement.\n\nSo if the market has only had 10 years of actual progression, that's not very long. It took 15 years for cellphones, consoles, and PCs to take off, even longer to hit most homes, and even longer still to modernize and have their current UX.",

        "comment": "Two of the more interesting reminders from this article:\n\nTo worship at the altar of mega-scale and to convince yourself that you should be the one making world-historic decisions on behalf of a global citizenry that did not elect you and may not share your values or lack thereof, you have to dispense with numerous inconveniences‚Äîhumility and nuance among them. Many titans of Silicon Valley have made these trade-offs repeatedly. YouTube (owned by Google), Instagram (owned by Meta), and Twitter (which Elon Musk insists on calling X) have been as damaging to individual rights, civil society, and global democracy as Facebook was and is. Considering the way that generative AI is now being developed throughout Silicon Valley, we should brace for that damage to be multiplied many times over in the years ahead.\n\nThe behavior of these companies and the people who run them is often hypocritical, greedy, and status-obsessed. But underlying these venalities is something more dangerous, a clear and coherent ideology that is seldom called out for what it is: authoritarian technocracy. As the most powerful companies in Silicon Valley have matured, this ideology has only grown stronger, more self-righteous, more delusional, and‚Äîin the face of rising criticism‚Äîmore aggrieved.\n\nThe new technocrats are ostentatious in their use of language that appeals to Enlightenment values‚Äîreason, progress, freedom‚Äîbut in fact they are leading an antidemocratic, illiberal movement. Many of them profess unconditional support for free speech, but are vindictive toward those who say things that do not flatter them. They tend to hold eccentric beliefs: that technological progress of any kind is unreservedly and inherently good; that you should always build it, simply because you can; that frictionless information flow is the highest value regardless of the information‚Äôs quality; that privacy is an archaic concept; that we should welcome the day when machine intelligence surpasses our own. And above all, that their power should be unconstrained. The systems they‚Äôve built or are building‚Äîto rewire communications, remake human social networks, insinuate artificial intelligence into daily life, and more‚Äîimpose these beliefs on the population, which is neither consulted nor, usually, meaningfully informed. All this, and they still attempt to perpetuate the absurd myth that they are the swashbuckling underdogs.\n\n...\n\n‚ÄúOur enemy,‚Äù Andreessen writes, is ‚Äúthe know-it-all credentialed expert worldview, indulging in abstract theories, luxury beliefs, social engineering, disconnected from the real world, delusional, unelected, and unaccountable‚Äîplaying God with everyone else‚Äôs lives, with total insulation from the consequences.‚Äù\n\nThe irony is that this description very closely fits Andreessen and other Silicon Valley elites. The world that they have brought into being over the past two decades is unquestionably a world of reckless social engineering, without consequence for its architects, who foist their own abstract theories and luxury beliefs on all of us.\n\nThis article serves as a useful summary for us about some of the philosophical and/or political underpinnings of a good number of Silicon Valley's power brokers and their supporters. It's good to question regularly both the logic and the motives of those pushing these kinds of narratives, and measure them against what we might want for ourselves and our society. But to do this, there also need to be compelling visions about the basics of what we might want of our cultures and societies.",

It was so much fun!\n\n...\n\nNot.\n\nI plug in the OQ2 and turn it on, it boots up, and I have to (again, the damn thing never moved locations) set the boundaries of where I'm at. I see the world around me. No menu appears. I click all the buttons, nothing happens.\n\nTurn it off, turn it on again.\n\nOkay, now I get the question if I want to link it to my PC. YES. It failed. Now, I have the OQ2 interface and menu with no way of getting to my PC. So I go to settings, find that connect setting thing, click it, and turn it on again, and now I'm in a DIFFERENT menu.\n\nIn this 2nd menu I can click \"desktop\" and I finally see my desktop. For some reason, all kinds of other menus are in front of my desktop, so in order to get to my Steam menu item I have to stand up or clumsily move things out of the way. Something that doesn't ever work the way you expect it to.\n\nI felt like Peter.\n\nOkay. Steam is up. I click ACC and click launch. Yes launch it in Oculus VR mode. The game boots up. Except it's in screen-mode, not VR mode...\n\nClose the game. Try again. Same shit. Turn off headset.\n\nOkay, now I get the question if I want to link it to my PC. YES. It failed. Now, I have the OQ2 interface and menu with no way of getting to my PC. So I go to settings, find that connect setting thing, click it, and turn it on again, and now I'm in a DIFFERENT menu.\n\nIn this 2nd menu I can click \"desktop\" and I finally see my desktop.

This time it's in VR mode! Yay!\n\nAll of this took at least 30 minutes to get going and my face is sweating inside the OQ2, the left lens is getting damp, and when I turned it on the last time it only had 60% battery remaining (from 100% at the start.)\n\nSo I get to racing, kinda, a bit. Despite the best possible connection (I tested it, I got the right cables, I changed all the relevant settings, I searched Reddit and GPT and Google to refine it all)... it's just a low-res mess with a low framerate. It's nice I can look into the corner but man, at what cost? Still, I race a few laps and I forgive the OQ2 for replacing my (very good) speaker system with its own (very bad) built-in \"audio\" system. My position in the car is a little too high on one camera setting, a little too low on another, and too far back in the 3rd...\n\nPlus, the left lens is sweating more than my forehead by now.\n\nSo I unplug the damn thing and throw it to the floor without giving it a second look. Back to my 32\" 4k 144Hz screen.\n\nBliss.\n\nThere's a reason almost no pro sim racers use VR.\n\nThere's a reason people will throw money at Apple for their Vision Pro headset. Because preliminary reviews already show: the damn thing is just plug & play, replacing masks, lenses, headbands, etc. is as simple as gently putting the thing near the magnets inside it.\n\nThe Apple Vision Pro looks like what Oculus dreams it could be 15 years from today. And Apple is setting the bar.",

It's literally war level profiteering and your political parties are absolutely captured by the \"doctors\".\n\nShit just ending the war on drugs would allow the US to extend health care coverage to everyone who needed it (of course undermining private health insurance thus destroying the iron grip employers have over employees).\n\nThe expenditure for law enforcement, judicial and prison costs for 50 states is approximately $3-9b per state just on illicit drugs.\n\n$300b per year plus.\n\nPlus the huge benefit of making illegal drugs legal so people can obtain health care, rehab and other treatments. For example ibudilast blocks TLR4 allowing opiate \"withdrawals\" (their withdrawalsto be greatly reduced). This sort of thing would result in massive productivity gains, reduction in accidents and what not.\n\nAnd the hundreds of billions the sale of MDMA, LSD, Mesc, cannabis and other drugs would net if sold in a safe and controlled system.\n\nAccess to cheap clinic provided heroin, like the methadone and Buprenorphine programs (utterly proven to work programs by the way) would reduce the huge sickening death toll in the US due to the contamination of illicit drugs with fentanly and other synthetic opiods.\n\nGiving people heroin has been straight proven to getting people off illegal drugs, massive improvements in health and staggering decreases in theft and robberies.\n\nBut hey keep throwing drug users into jail, keep letting cartels and the CCP and North Korea profiting from synthetic fent and keep enabling your cops to be the biggest losers, 50 years of unrestrained policing, unlimited budgets and these losers in blue keep failing.\n\nAnd for the health system, lol, you guys will never be able to stop the insurers, hospitals and doctors from robbing you blind.....",

The US probably has capabilities that they would prefer not to talk about even to lawmakers who a lot (not all) are inherently stupid, corrupt or both. An example of this is undersea detection sensors which all costs money to maintain. If you look back at the OceanGate sub incident the Navy knew what had happened as they picked up the implosion the moment it happened but stayed quiet and allowed the search to happen.\n\nNot saying any arguments are right or wrong as we'll likely never get an answer but just wanted to add something that I feel is always missed on these UFO discussions.",

Absolutely believed we spent too much on stuff even though it wasnt even HIS money as he wasnt even a taxpayer in the state he was working in... We had a opportunity to go in with Verizon on running fiber between all of our buildings for a significantly reduced cost... I am talking 2 million to cover fiber runs from street to network room and between 15 buildings in 2004... that was unheard of at the time.\n\nSaid no it was a waste our 10 Mbps DSL was fine...\n\n3 years later we are spending 8 million to do EXACTLY the same thing we could have spent 2 million on because 10 Mbps WAS NOT FINE. To boot we are doing all the setup work once its in the building ourselves, terminating the fiber, etc... all stuff Verizon was going to do for us.\n\nThen there are the pet projects that go absolutely fucking nowhere because X person gets influenced by some moron lobbyist, and then 4 years later all of its sitting unused waiting to be thrown away because they dont want to take the time to sell it and re-invest that money into things (or cant because of bullshit rules.)\n\nGovernment can work, and can work efficiently... but there are far too many players and party people and influencers who make it their mission TO not let it work efficiently, because if it did, then they could not campaign on Government is Broken... just look at the USPS where they were only in debt due to arbitrary and ridiculous pension funding rules... or the IRS where they had literally the textbook PERFECT case of a government project done right with their data warehouse, not just done on time but significantly under budget and started earning back the money to justify it within a year... completely sabotaged because it started going after high level tax cheats.... so parties within the government basically shut it down and stripped the IRS of people to force them to target lower and middle class where the money wasnt... and could not get the funding to go after your million and billionaires and major companies.",

It's common sense that they have serious data on these things. These incursions are not rare and often occur around military assets.\n\nSo then you're left to interpret the actions of those who do care; congress and the Senate. Well given the UAP disclosure act seems to have been more or less written by Grusch it's clear Schumer takes him seriously. He's stated openly on the senate floor that multiple credible sources are claiming that information regarding UAPs is being illegally withheld from congress (I can find the cspan clip if you want).\n\nSo basically the top lawmakers driving this are sure they are being lied to and writing bills that force disclosure of \"non human biologics\" (in the bill's own words). It's clear were moving more and more towards the conclusion that a lot of the so called \"conspiracy theories\" may end up as conspiracy fact. At the very least it's unequivocal that the conversation has shifted from\n\nAre UFOs real?\n\nTo\n\nAre UFOs aliens and do we really have secret reverse engineering programs\n\nSince 2017.",

The AARO dog and pony show has been such a disappointment to watch. It's not speculation to say that Kirkpatrick knows more than he's saying. Numerous whitnesses have stated publicly that they spoke to AARO. Yet Kirkpatrick reports they have no credible whitnesses to this stuff. Word on the street is this was why he was let go.\n\nEven just watching the UAP shoot downs last year; how can anyone buy that they don't have images of things they're shooting missiles at. I mean come on? Were we born yesterday? Meanwhile pilots were telling CNN that the objects jammed they're systems. Doesn't sound like a hobbyist balloon to me.

Spy balloon? Here's high res images and video. Everything else? Radio silence. Let the hobbyist balloon rumor circulate.\n\nWhat's odd to me is that numerous US and Canadian officials avoided calling it balloon. Months later we get absolutely no information. The last story I heard came from the journalist who brought Grusch forward. He claimed that there was a UAP sighting in which jets were scrambled in Alaska days before the shoot downs.\n\nBacking up for a second; there's also the observation that our adversary's advanced spy tech was a balloon. So... Does that mean the UAP we've been witnessing aren't from China or Russia? Because we've been told out pilots are seeing next generation technologies. So if they're not from China or Russia, and they're not ours...",

It would be highly unusual for somone to come up with something in Physics that was entirely at odds with everything else we know. Where, at present, there are disagreements it's not that there two things that are both true to the exclusion of the other, like Relativity and Quantam Mechanics, but rather two things that are true that we don't know how they fit together yet. In both cases we know them to be true, or essentially as close to truth as we can express, and both were hinted at and suggested by previous knowledge before they were ultimately adopted as mainstream... Its Einstein's Theory of Relativity, after all, because his was the one that stuck and not the dozens of other Relativistic theories proposed before and after him.\n\nSo if YOU are going to argue, \"idk, maybe the aliens have FTL capabiltities\" its up to YOU to prove that that is possible.

C. incident. At 8:52 PM (11:52 PM Washington) on July 19th 1952, three bright, transient point sources of light were imaged at Palomar Observatory. These three point sources then vanished permanently within the next 50 minutes, and have not been observed subsequently. [39][40] The team also revealed a second coincidence with five bright transient sources coinciding with the Washington UFO flyover, on the 27th of July 1952 (00:47 AM Washington D.C. time). The five transient sources had an unusual alignment with a probability of 1 in 10 000 and appeared and vanished within 50 minutes.",

Not saying everything in science fiction is possible, but having even a fictional example can give someone something to strive towards and create that otherwise might have been thought of as impossible.",

If the Soviets refused to negotiate a point, they were intransigent and belligerent; if they appeared willing to make concessions, this was but a skillful ploy to put us off our guard. By opposing arms limitations, they would have demonstrated their aggressive intent; but when in fact they supported most armament treaties, it was because they were mendacious and manipulative. If the churches in the USSR were empty, this demonstrated that religion was suppressed; but if the churches were full, this meant the people were rejecting the regime's atheistic ideology. If the workers went on strike (as happened on infrequent occasions), this was evidence of their alienation from the collectivist system; if they didn't go on strike, this was because they were intimidated and lacked freedom. A scarcity of consumer goods demonstrated the failure of the economic system; an improvement in consumer supplies meant only that the leaders were attempting to placate a restive population and so maintain a firmer hold over them.\n\nIf communists in the United States played an important role struggling for the rights of workers, the poor, African-Americans, women, and others, this was only their guileful way of gathering support among disfranchised groups and gaining power for themselves. How one gained power by fighting for the rights of powerless groups was never explained. What we are dealing with is a nonfalsifiable orthodoxy, so assiduously marketed by the ruling interests that it affected people across the entire political spectrum.‚Äù\n\n‚Äï Michael Parenti, Blackshirts and Reds: Rational Fascism and the Overthrow of Communism",

In Massachusetts, where I am, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any move to get rid of net metering (but I know the utilities are up to no good around here)‚Ä¶but the state does now have a program that will pay anyone with a grid tied battery to allow the grid to use it in summer evenings as part of a distributed battery solution. The payment structure is actually quite preferential‚Ä¶and will pay for the cost of the battery over 10 years.¬† ¬†\n\nI‚Äôve been looking into it. I have a natural gas powered house generator‚Ä¶and it would actually be quite easy for me to tie a battery, my solar and a generator together and go off-grid entirely - with the gas generator only turning on to recharge the battery when it gets below a certain threshold. Enphase, who makes my solar inverters, makes a unit that handles the switching. But with net metering here, it‚Äôs slightly more economical to just leave it all connected.",

We simply cannot let state and private interests fragment and undermine energy security of our country. A public investment in a national nuclear power grid with a hundred year planning horizon will contribute to a stable economy, domestic energy independence, and long-term international economic competitiveness.\n\nRooftop solar in America is like trying to save the environment by banning plastic shopping bags. Its environmentalist virtue signaling without really accomplishing anything significant, except enriching some greasy solar sales companies.\n\nThat said, solar makes a LOT of sense in China which has a huge land area with a loosely distributed rural population.

My dad was working for a US company providing technology for poly production, and most of the projects were in China, especially, IIRC, Xinjiang, Gansu and Shanxi which were traditionally poorer more desolate regions. Looking at where a lot of their farms are now though, those areas make some sense as there‚Äôs just more space. But there was a serious mad dash at the time, with a lot of projects that didn‚Äôt make sense; my dad had also worked with SMIC on trying to turn their waste silicon from chip production into panels.\n\nOn a side note, I remember going to a meeting between my dad and Richard Chang, founder of SMIC. We went to his office on a summer Saturday. There was no AC, lights were off, windows open, and Richard was wearing a pair of cheap plastic shower flip flops. Dude was notoriously cheap and weird.",

WHY, yeah cheaper cars due to less regs and such, but mainly, china built a fucking charging network when everyone already knew the future was electric, and so their auto industry jumped on it, while ours creamed \"there is no demand\" yeah when people dont know where to charge, that dampens demand. We just started to build ours after the competition already had to bend the knee and buy into elons network, since we were too stupid to build our own.\n\nbut we did help elon build his... instead of building our own.\n\nWE hardly invest in this country anymore and the only time we can get minor shit done is when the dems have all three branches of the right wont let us fund shit. Biden managed to push through subsidies in the inflation reduction act to help people put solar on their homes. Much like Obama did, china and the EU are doing and trump did not. right now due to inflation reduction act, which was the biggest green act we ever did and not really inflation. you can get up to 30% off of panels and installation.\n\n(dont forget it was republicans who ripped the solar off the WH)",

While the U.S. is still playing catch-up, China is blazing ahead, capitalizing on its manufacturing might and less bureaucratic red tape. It's not just about the sheer number of panels either. It's about the commitment to a sustainable future, and clearly, China is betting big on solar. Sure, they've got their share of environmental issues, but this move is a solid step in the right direction.\n\nOn the other hand, the U.S. needs to step up its game. Not just in terms of installation but in manufacturing as well. Relying on imports for solar tech isn't going to cut it in the long run. We need a dual approach, boost domestic production and ramp up installations. Only then can we hope to match or exceed the pace set by China in the renewable energy race. And let's not forget, this isn't just a numbers game. Every panel installed means less reliance on fossil fuels, a smaller carbon footprint, and a step closer to a cleaner, more sustainable planet. So, kudos to China for leading the charge, and here's hoping the U.S. takes note and accelerates its efforts.",

Up to a certain ratio at least, due to their natural fluctuations.\n\nAnd that ratio will continue to climb, as grid storage has finally hit the critical point in its exponential growth curve. If lithium prices continue to rise, there are now multiple viable alternative technologies that can take over as the predominant grid storage types. And all of these battery types continue to get better and cheaper at a rapid pace.\n\nIt's also worth noting that not even China is investing much into nuclear power. They are building a few new reactors, but their overall share of nuclear power is stagnating at around 5%. They also made some pretty bad experiences with modern reactor types in recent years and may very well even reduce it. Nuclear is simply too expensive and too slow to build, even in countries with much lower planning and regulatory hurdles and without much care for environmental groups.",

            "comment": "Power requirements rise and various power plant types take different amount of time to build. Here they are in a small list with pros and cons.\n\nWind and geothermal, while can be built offsite, it takes some time to build and can obviously be only in specific places. Wind is also loud and it heats up local climate. Can be very cheap and easy to maintain.\nSolar requires a bit of space and it can take a long time to set up, because installation requires a lot of labour. While it's \"setup and forget\" kind of infrastructure (at least compared to power plants) it is sensitive to supply chains because it requires a lot of solar pane specific electric infrastructure. It is also hard to build in countries with a lot of freedom of property, because in most western countries you can't order property owners to build solar panels, meanwhile in china you can force it in new buildings. Solar panels themselves are dirt cheap, main cost is installation and it's hard to make installation cheaper though mass scaling. Major advantage is that it's resistant to price changes because material costs are negligible.\nCoal. Even though it requires bigger infrastructure, it is extremely space and material efficient, and does not require advanced infrastructure. It's best option for fast build up, and the fuel is basically infinite. Major disadvantages is local health effects on population because coal contains toxic and radioactive elements so the better the healthcare and more valuable labour, the higher the additional costs.\nGas. Much cleaner than Coal, but requires piping infrastructure or use of tankers. Low density of gas makes it more expensive to transport and buildup of plants takes longer time. It is also orders of magnitude more rare than coal.\nNuclear. Immense costs of research and safety make it doubtful to be cost effective. Costs and time to build the plant are usually too high for private enterprises, that is why it was generally build for self sustainability or by governments for a source of plutonium and because governments were able to absorb the big costs. My personal favorite.\nWater. Currently cheapest way to generate electricity (geothermal can go lower sometimes). Takes a long time to build, but gives biggest gains after the buildup. Likely cheapest upkeep compared to any other power source. High density of power, perfect for big cities and easy to scale power production when needed. Still unknown effects on fauna and flora, but less important for less agrarian societies.\n\nWhen it comes to energy storage, it is extremely useful for every single type of power, except water and geothermal. Even when in combination with coal or gas, it decreases use of fuel, but disadvantage is extremely high costs of manufacturing and no market use. Energy storage can't be used in such a big scale anywhere else so it has to be manufactured specifically for energy storage and the current infrastructure already depends on lack of use of energy storage. Makes it non cost effective to make batteries for stationary storage, although TESLA is planning on making iron phosphorus, low energy density batteries for that purpose.",

Grok is literally less than useless.¬†\n\nElon could have made a free speech AI that gives the most honest answers possible while not instructing people on how to do anything illegal. The reason he didn't is because he's smart enough to know that there are many layers of lies that also underpin his own public perception and the class to which he belongs.
