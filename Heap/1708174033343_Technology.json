If that was accepted it would mean they could continue with this plan and any time bot gets it's wrong they would already have a precedent that it's not their fault, it's bot's. As insane as it sounds.\n\nBut judge effectively told them to screw off and that it's their software running on their site so they ARE responsible for it being accurate.\n\nSo they had to shut down the whole thing as it's only a matter of time for more errors like this popped up - after all LLMs are known to hallucinate. They will list policies that don't exist (like in this case), they can also tell you your flight is canceled or delayed, you can probably convince one to give you 99% discount too.\n\nSo it's not a battle for 800 CAD.

Meta frames boosts as a tool that many \"small businesses\" use, but it's also being used by celebrities, brands, and individuals looking for more eyes on their content.\n\nWhen Meta adds Apple's surcharge to boosts bought through its Facebook and Instagram iOS mobile apps, users will be able to easily avoid this buy simply buying boosts on a web browser, like Safari or Chrome, instead.\n\nThe fee can be avoided through mobile browsers too, meaning users don't have to be on a laptop or computer. They just need to leave the iOS app itself.\n\nBoosts purchased through Meta's iOS apps will also have to be paid in full in advance when the Apple service fee takes effect.

There's someone wrong on the internet, I've got to do something about it!'\"\n\nMark Zuckerberg has entered his Posting Era.\n\nApple's Vision Pro might be the first time the two companies are directly competing, but their bad blood goes way back. Apple and Facebook have been beefing since Ping.\n\nSome of this back-and-forth is playing out on Meta's own Threads, where Meta executives and employees are highly active, and a handful of rank-and-file employees have grown large audiences.\n\nNot infrequently, those employees are complaining about Apple.\n\n \n\nThis is a business strategy.\n\nMeta faces big challenges — not just competition to its VR headset business, but the ongoing existential problems that have long plagued it: shifting consumer habits away from public posting, competition from TikTok, lawsuits from states and cities over its products' potentially addictive and harmful effects on teens, lingering distrust by the public as a result of a decade of mistakes and bad decisions about the safety and integrity of the product.\n\nIt's tempting to compare Zuckerberg's new zest for posting with that other keyboard-happy tech CEO.\n\nBut Elon Musk's X habit is more like the impulsive spewing of what's inside his mind — often coming with significant negative costs to him and his companies.",

The reason is that the compiler or library can make multiple versions of a piece of code, each optimized for a certain processor and instruction set, for example SSE2, SSE3, etc. The system includes a function that detects which type of CPU it is running on and chooses the optimal code path for that CPU. This is called a CPU dispatcher. However, the Intel CPU dispatcher does not only check which instruction set is supported by the CPU, it also checks the vendor ID string. If the vendor string says \"GenuineIntel\" then it uses the optimal code path. If the CPU is not from Intel then, in most cases, it will run the slowest possible version of the code, even if the CPU is fully compatible with a better version.",

The reason is that the compiler or library can make multiple versions of a piece of code, each optimized for a certain processor and instruction set, for example SSE2, SSE3, etc. The system includes a function that detects which type of CPU it is running on and chooses the optimal code path for that CPU. This is called a CPU dispatcher. However, the Intel CPU dispatcher does not only check which instruction set is supported by the CPU, it also checks the vendor ID string. If the vendor string says \"GenuineIntel\" then it uses the optimal code path. If the CPU is not from Intel then, in most cases, it will run the slowest possible version of the code, even if the CPU is fully compatible with a better version.\n\nIn this recent case, they purposefully targeted the benchmark so when it ran, the benchmark would run faster. The particular instructions they used to make it faster are not used in any other kind of application, only for that benchmark, so it has little to no real world reason for the compiler to do that.\n\nIn layman’s terms, SPEC is accusing Intel of optimizing the compiler specifically for its benchmark, which means the results weren’t indicative of how end users could expect to see performance in the real world. Intel’s custom compiler might have been inflating the relevant results of the SPEC test by up to 9%.\n\n\"The compiler used for this result was performing a compilation that specifically improves the performance of the 523.xalancbmk_r / 623.xalancbmk_s benchmarks using a priori knowledge.\"",

China's fight against Biden is laughable because they really think a psycho like Trump wouldn't try to confront them directly with weapons, when Trump would just cut deals with Putin to isolate China diplomatically .. which is the core of multi-polar political theory.\n\nThe election will be divisive and damaging for America\n\nThis narrative works better outside the US although it might work on Trump/MAGA type populations, but they already believe the election isn't real anyway so the idea of a \"competition\" being promoted here falls flat. This is done almost exclusively for foreigners who know nothing about American politics, voting, Federalism, or what the \"bill of rights\" does because their countries don't have it. The actual spread of this propaganda is in places where they think these are real campaign posters by political parties .. like the ones America sponsors in their own countries.\n\nThis is especially viewable with the \"chronic death\" / civic decay themes, which don't work well in the US because Americans never expected much from their big cities anyway .. which is why most own suburban homes instead. Again, this is another play to the third world and people that aren't American who think the entire US is a superfund site full of armed tweakers.",

By which I mean that when you post content on Reddit, you --with \"you\" here referring to the poster of the content-- then you still own the copyright to the content and are legally allowed to sell it.\n\nYou could ask an LLM to choose a topic and find the most important three thousand posters on that topic and then contact them directly asking them to license their content. Reddit would still have to host all the content because that's their business model --publishing other people's content.\n\nHit me up if you want to buy the u/Ahfoo archives. . .\n\nI'd point out, for instance, that my archives are edited. . . by me and I have a professional degree in editing. Ask your AI what the average literacy rate of my comments is. Sorting users this way can help dig out some of the best content. Most of the content at Reddit is cruft but not all of it.

I was very grateful that all of my calls were recorded by the insurance company, and even more grateful that they didn’t have some “random glitch” during the call when the employee incorrectly stated my surgery would be fully covered.\n\nThat previous comment, where they used “a billion $” as an example would be so extreme that a reasonable person (customer) would have every reason to doubt the employee’s claims.

You want a high valuation from investors so you can sell the smallest amount of the company for the most money.\n\nBut for the 409A team, you sell them the downer picture. Tons of risk, unproven market, no clear path to profitability, etc. You want to depress the 409A valuation as much as possible because the fair market value price anchors your stock option strike prices.",

The main hiring frenzy was in hiring anyone with a sales baclground to essentially act as old navy cashiers working through the glut of companies rushing to digitize their operations.\n\nWith those huge sales numbers came postsales staffing needs which were very difficult to accurately predict. So companies overhired there as well since they were flush with the sales revenue.\n\nThen, the middle/end of year 2 of covid hit. Sales slowed to a trickle and all those sales people had nothing to do. Postsales worked through their backlog as well.\n\nYear 3 january layoffs were a direct result of the ass end of that wave.\n\nThen ai hit hard.\n\nNow companies are reevaluating after their kneejerk year 3 layoffs by reorging around ai related job functions. That means more layoffs in some areas and actually hiring back sales/postsales in other areas.\n\nThis will continue for this year then well see another large reorg in q1 next year at most tech companies, especially enterprise saas.\n\nOver the following 10 years, well likely see a lot of massive companies unable to effectively transform their operations to keep up with their industries who are taking full advantage of ai.

Suddenly there's understaffing everywhere and all those people stressing out are simply told that they have to swallow it or else there's plenty of people out there willing to take their jobs for less money.\n\nI have an issue when these companies are doing it purely to please shareholders and there really isn't any other reason. Yes, I know the shareholders invested, but if we make everything always about shareholders, then these companies shouldn't be surprised that they get no loyalty and no one willing to go above and beyond for them.\n\nI also have a deep issue if any of these kinds of cuts are some kind of underhanded tactic to give more power to employers. To create artificial levels of job scarcity. So now everybody is scared and will stop asking for remote working privileges or shorter work weeks or work life balance.\n\nIt's hard to really gauge if layoffs are really necessary or just underhanded tactics. I also have to agree with others that if executives are going to be this reactive and make big mistakes like over hiring people they had no work for, then those executives should also be on the chopping block.\n\nLike others, I get really tired of management seemingly immune to consequences for their actions when average people would be fired.",

It was a huge change. No more suffering to try to hit it big.\n\nThen they started to change the rules to negate a lot of the jackpot.\n\nEither way I do feel people do have to consider the position they are taking. If the company or the job seems thin/hard to justify then it's fine to take the money but plan B better be close at hand. Make sure you can land on your feet if things end abruptly.\n\nIn the end, these companies did pay people well for two years for work that I guess they didn't even need. That's nice if you're the kind who likes to be paid. It's a pretty serious economic stimulus, doubly so if it's going into your own pocket! It's not all downside if it can't continue forever.",

        "comment": "One of the most important things to realize is the difference between what matters to a company and what matters to the people running the company.  The company doesn't get a say in what happens.  The people running it make the calls.  For the most part, they aren't interested in a moral imperative or long-term plan.  They care about next quarter or maybe next year.\n\nStock goes up and stock goes down.  The company doesn't really benefit much from short-term changes.  Even longer term trends aren't all that relevant to the company's day to day.  You don't have more computers and more workers one day because the stock is up 1.3% and you don't have fewer tools and staff the next day with its 2.6% drop.  Only a few very significant things a company can do matter w.r.t. stock -- and those are generally undertaken by the leaders if they have a very good near-term benefit.\n\nCities are pushing to get workers back into the office.  They're offering incentives.  Companies are forcing people back into the office to get that money.  It's a good way to get an uptick for next quarter's earnings.  Whether it's more or less productive doesn't factor in to it.  Nor does the fact that once the current crisis is over, cities are going to go back to charging employment taxes and other revenue streams because there are too many cars/people/whatever commuting into the city every day.\n\nAs an executive, you come on board and hope the stock is down and goes down just a bit more.  If you believe it'll go back up, the lower it is today and tomorrow, the better.  Any near term losses you blame on your predecessor.  Then, the market turns around and stock goes up.  Your compensation is primarily in stock and so you're making bank.  Plus, your resume looks amazing now that the company had its turn around while you were there \"making an impact\" -- by which I mean, creating a lot of busy work while folks learn how to satisfy your demands while doing the thing the company actually needs to survive.\n\nYou take credit, get a great offer with even more money at another company that's in a lull, and bounce before the bad policies you insisted on actually crumble the company.  The morale tanks, the skilled labor exits, the company starts to fail... But, you're already at your next gig waiting for the market to recover.\n\nThis is a jaded perspective.  I'm not sure that it's entirely wrong.  I think companies whose compensation came in the form of annual dividends paid out over the life of the company rather than in stock the executive dumps as quickly as they can to diversify would go a long way towards aligning incentives.  Maybe the executive whose retirement depends on this company being around and successful in 20 years will care about tech debt.\n\nUntil then, those good employees who care more about the actual company and its needs, who work extra hard and long to do what's actually important while also trying to tick the boxes for optics, and who get relatively little in return are the only reasons companies make it.  When they go, the company goes.\n\nMiddle managers everywhere are judged for promotion or hire based upon the size of their organization.  Their incentive is to have bloat.  Hire, hire, hire.  Hire someone who's good at growing their team under you so you benefit from their efforts.  Hire folks who make arguments that sound good and can get funding.  That's the ticket!  Don't keep a lean organization filled with people passionate about the company and knowledgeable about its needs.  That'll get you nowhere fast.\n\nExecutives and middle managers see the company as a means towards their own ends.  If you're confused about why things are the way they are, this is likely why.  You're thinking about the company and the values and goals it has.  You're not thinking today, what can I do to make my boss richer even if it means destroying everything.  That's the power of misaligned incentives.  Zuckerberg lays folks off to balance the detrimental effects of those leaders and their inherent need to grow their orgs.",

I definitely understand there are times when companies are shrinking and layoffs are required. That does not seem to be what’s happening now. My own company didn’t meet its revenue growth expectations. They made plenty of money they just didn’t grow the revenue to the degree that they projected. For this their stock price paid a heavy price. Immediately afterwards they started several rounds of layoffs that I would describe as random at best. At their next earnings report though their stock price was rewarded because they beat their projected revenue. Stock price hasn’t returned to its all time high but I’m sure after a couple more layoffs it will. We’ve had unending meetings since where they pay themselves on the back for righting the ship. This is all while my team has literally lost some of the most important people we have and it took several months before top level bosses became concerned that customers were being told that features they were promised will not be delivered. The developers working on them are gone though so it’s not difficult to parse out why. I’m not saying all of these companies don’t legitimately have reasons for layoffs. Just that what they tell investors is usually something crafted to bring comfort to the investors, themselves, and the people who were laid off. I think he rarely resembles the truth.",

Rich people are eliminating labor, and therefore the capacity of working class to obtain value from their labor, and pocketing the money they save to make themselves even richer. At a certain point, there won't be enough jobs left for the population to support itself.\n\nPeople will be pushed into low-paying, precarious, gig economy work, for one, and when those job fields become saturated, then they'll be essentially no way for unskilled/uneducates labor to make a living. It's already bad for them as it currently is, and it can get immeasurably worse. Even skilled positions that require eduction will be filled by people willing to be paid a small fraction of what the work is actually worth. Extreme competitiveness in the job market will lead to extreme downward pressure on wages.\n\nThe wealth disparity will shoot up exponentially, and it's already currently at levels that haven't been observed since the Great Depression and the French Revolution.\n\nWhen there are not enough jobs to allow the general population to consume/purchase the goods that are now being produced through non-human work, there's bound to be a huge economic crash.\n\nWe're headed for a potential crisis along class lines that the world has never seen before, and that our institutions will be entirely unable to handle.\n\nThat's the problem.",

A chatbot is nothing more than a script that will simulate a conversation with you. Expecting it to provide you with reliable accurate information is incredibly naïve though.\n\nI think the problem is that most people have no fucking clue what an LLM does or what its actual goals are. People have just up and decided that they're sentient beings or some crazy shit, when in reality, they simply predict the next word or series of words given the preceding text.\n\nEg - \"I like big butts and\" will almost certainly be followed by \"I cannot lie\", so that's what an LLM will most likely fill in. If the Top-P setting is low enough, you could get some other responses that might make sense, or they might just be nonsense.\n\nBut if you present it with something truly novel, it's just going to formulate a response that sounds correct, but it has no way of verifying if it is correct. Which is how we get things like having a customer ask it how to receive a bereavement discount on their flights, and since it has no clue what the policy is, it just provides an answer that sounds correct.\n\nWhat's hilarious is seeing people trying to convince an LLM to research and verify its answers, when it has no capability to do so.",

LLMs are good enough that it doesn't need that level of understanding to output functional, useful results in no time at all, especially when it can cross-reference and link to sources when requested. If it doesn't output anything useful then you can tell from the output, and all you've done is waste a few seconds on a project that will take much longer.\n\nI can sit here and figure out how to write a script to do a task from scratch, or I can just ask an LLM. The LLM's result may not work the first time, but I can just tell the model what error I got and it will likely fix it and explain what it (or I!) got wrong - it's interactive unlike any other technology. If it can't, I still have a script that is 90% of the way there to debug which takes a fraction of the time. It's very rare for it to spit out code that is complete nonsense, and it absolutely will make things that haven't been made before.\n\nThe models can be tuned for minimal creativity, which reduces hallucinations. They can also connect to other services to figure out stuff the model could struggle with, such as Wolfram Alpha for maths calculations.\n\nThey're usually good at summarizing text because it has a set of hard facts to work from, and can read a whole book or email archive in seconds. For research it can be much more nuanced than a Google search (such as finding studies of a certain sample size or a particular method), but again, a human would need to verify the output. I was wasting loads of time trying to find old emails with dates of insurance claims, turns out Bard can do that instantly (with references).\n\nThe models are so good at prediction that it outputs perfectly usable results in most of these cases, and giving it a 'true' set of facts to check against (such as pages on the internet, which goes from Wikipedia to official docs to Stack Overflow) hugely improves accuracy. Tom Scott pretty much mirrored your view, until he tried it for a coding task - I'd suggest watching his video. They aren't useless, they just can't operate independently.",

On the other hand, that amount is irrelevant to substantial operations.\n\nMuch of the time, scammers aren't even using their own money. Instead, they're using financial, banking, or credit card credentials previously extracted from *other* victims. And we're not talking about a paltry $5 or $10. We're speaking hundreds, thousands -- or even lifetime savings. Fake crypto scams, advance fee scams, pin/verification scams, tech support, fake payment scams, recovery scams, etc.\n\nThat's just scammers. Bots operate in a similar fashion. That introduces volume and scale. Again, $8/mo is meaningless. Ten accounts for $80/mo? 100 accounts for $800/mo? Meh... Chump change to some of these operations. Whoever is behind a particular bot network typically isn't paying for it. Their client is. Whether it's to boost (fake) engagement, spread disinformation, or whatever -- it works. For the client, that may be sufficient bot activity to promote/spread their agenda.\n\nWhether bots or scammers, there's little motivation for Musk to shut them down. Why? Again, it's ego with the numbers game. Prior to being forced to buy Twitter, Musk pulled a claim out of his ass how Twitter had ~20% bots. This was versus previous ownership's citation of 5%.\n\nHeck, it's become a meme to summon bots. Configure a post with particular keywords and bots will dogpile in the responses. Sometimes ChatGPT bots become ornery and will begin spitting out invalid prompts.\n\nAbout the blue checkmark thing... Scammers and bot owners are thankful for that. Innocent and naïve people can easily be duped because they believe these accounts are verified. Without aggressive enforcement, Twitter itself is profiting from these grifters.\n\nMusk claimed he was going to solve the bot problem. Now that he owns Twitter, he's finding out he needs the bots to keep these engagements/impressions up.",

Digg users reacted with hostile verbal opposition. Beyond the release, Digg faced problems due to so-called \"power users\" who would manipulate the article recommendation features to only support one another's postings, flooding the site with articles only from these users and making it impossible to have genuine content from non-power users appear on the front page.[citation needed] Frustrations with the system led to dwindling web traffic, exacerbated by heavy competition from Facebook, whose like buttons started to appear on websites next to Digg's.[19] High staff turnover included the departure of head of business development Matt Van Horn, shortly after v4's release.[20]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg",

Post the exact same thing and the first few posts are negative about the thread's content, then you'll see a lot more like-minded, negative takes, while they make it harder for supporters/positive opinions to take hold.\n\nIt's kinda crazy, and I see all sorts of suspect threads and comments these days.

The death spiral already started, but choosing to farm fake engagement during one of the biggest brand/advertising moments will have lots of places not wanting to deal with the platform for at least the next year",

Unless the manuscript they’ve been given was different to the one published and lacked the images (which would be its own issue), I really don’t understand how this got as far as it did. I think everyone’s had reviewers pick up on much more minor issues than this before.\n\nOn the bright side, I’m sure this’ll be a useful example for teaching if nothing else",

Were you really expecting big tech to magically solve one of the biggest issues facing our generation overnight or something?\n\nImage/video/text generation just turns out to be easier, and returns more on investment. Humans gain the ability to dream about waifus well before they gain the skills to tackle climate change. So in retrospect it's not too surprising that AI will take a similar path.\n\nOr were you expecting AI to somehow learn how to save the planet without even learning to see, first? How can we expect a machine to learn to solve problems no human has been able to solve before (and no, everyone just deciding to do better isn't a solution) before it's learned trivial concepts like \"that glass fell, it will probably shatter\".\n\nI suppose you'd have all that money spent on charity or human researchers. But that already happens. But people are betting more on the \"climate scientist in a box, also it makes me $$$\", and I think that makes sense.\n\nI just don't understand this strange narrative that big tech could've easily replaced all the sucky jobs first, or solve world hunger, or whatever, and they're only putting out technology like this because they just really really hate artists and having fun.\n\nEDIT: Completely forgot about Google DeepMind's recent weather forecasting research. Probably a much better example of how AI research can benefit climate science.

Our political system is designed to resist democracy and sustain the power of the class that already owns everything. Politicians refuse to make policy and projects that will actually deal with the climate crisis on anywhere remotely the timeline necessary, even though a strong majority of the people want it.

It's like juggling. They need to keep things moving, but may not accomplish much to actually help the customer.\n\nIt can also be frustrating for some support staff if they know how to easily fix the problem but they're forced to follow a script. On the one hand it creates a baseline of support to measure against. Management love that sort of thing. On the other hand, for people who know more than the job requires it would be like wearing a straightjacket.\n\nIn some circumstances you may even not be allowed to help solve the customers tech problem. You may be forced to say it is some other companies fault. Then the customer gets stuck in the middle with everyone blaming everyone else and nothing gets done.\n\nSome telesales and tech support companies treat their staff worse than dirt. They're often overworked, understaffed and very expendable. They'll fire them for stupid, petty reasons.",

Hold for Me can only be activated once you’re already on hold and waiting for customer service to take your call.\n\nPlus, while Hold for Me is only supported on Pixel phones, Talk to a Live Rep is available on all devices. In addition, because Talk to a Live Rep asks you for the reason of the call, the customer service representative will already know why you’re calling the company, removing yet another step in the process.\n\nI was wondering the same.

I don’t know how I got rejected the first time but I thought I checked all the boxes. Was thoroughly heart broken to not even get an interview. I thought, if they won’t even interview me, how am I going to find a better fit. It seemed literally perfect. That’s what motivated the follow up letter.

Eric Lippert, a member of the ECMA design committee back in the 90s, eloquently summarized early JS in this memorable quote:\n\nJS was designed to make the monkey dance when you mouse over it.\n\nIt served its purpose pretty well back in the mid 90s. The implementations varied and thus sucked to work with, but that was not the language's fault. Then some years later, in 2004, Google released Gmail. It was a fairly full featured application that just loaded in your browser, no downloads or plugins needed. Of course that was because they had the audacity to write its UI in the monkey dance language! The code was unbelievably awful, I remember looking at it and shuddering. Meanwhile the utility of these new universal \"web apps\" was obvious. Google released more web apps, proving the feasibility. Others joined in.\n\nAs the decades passed JS had a lot of features tacked on to try and cater more towards web apps and the way the language was now being used. But, they are all backwards compatible, and so you still have a lot of legacy decisions that will never quite disappear.",

No matter how much training or brown bags they do…they still don’t understand the needs of the business. And I faced that at my last firm. I constantly had to meet with TA and HR on the type of candidates they were sending me. Frustrating to say the least. It’s what you get when you have 22-26yr olds with English lit degrees deciding how much experience a candidate should have…when they couldnt tell you the difference between JIRA and Salesforce….much less a technical skill.",

For those who don't know, there is a language in web that is JavaSCRIPT and its absolutely not the same as java.

A lot of those systems can be really finicky with how they interpret resume formatting, as well as what they're specifically looking for in terms of keywords.\n\nLike, if you put in a little extra work to make your resume look nice visually by formatting it differently, used \"non-standard\" subject headings or put them in a weird order, or even if the straight export to PDF was a little off and didn't tag the document correctly (which is something 99% of people aren't even going to know to check), it can lead to the ATS straight up not reading it and trashing it instead.\n\nSimilarly, if you aren't matching the language in the job description in your own experience bullet points (e.g. the description says \"Apply trend intelligence and an understanding of both historical and current market dynamics...\" and your response point was \"Applied conclusions from data-driven insights along with current and historical market dynamic context\"), the ATS could say that it's not similar enough to the language used in the description (especially if you're just slightly off in the same way throughout) and throw it out as not a good fit. Same thing applies to not including enough raw numbers or metrics from your past work (e.g. \"Increased engagement by 350% over 5 years\") - a lot of those systems look for specifics, and if they don't see any, you're out (though I'd say that adding in specific metrics is just a good practice anyways).\n\nWhen I was laid off 4 or 5 years ago, I think I had sent out 100+ resumes and gotten maybe 3 callbacks before I learned about all the right formatting stuff. Once I started tailoring my resumes to the specific listing, it jumped to closer to 30% callbacks and I had a job within the next two months.",

Sure the store is not as polished or feature rich as Steam, but atleast it's competing, compared to Microsoft whose Xbox store for windows is so bad I dont know why people even bother using it for game pass. Oh I know, I guess because it's cheap.\n\nFor the first time in PC gaming history have I seen people defend a monopoly this hard, just let Epic compete, they are no different from Sony or Microsoft or Valve, they are there to make money, if having exclusives is what they have to do to make money then let them.\n\nDon't use if you don't like it but don't pretend that using steam gives you some kind of moral high ground. I primarily use steam myself, but also recognize the benefits of using Epic's ecosystem as a game developer, and avid game enjoyer.\n\nHere is one guy who is taking on Apple, Google and Steam all alone and winning somewhat, and all people do is hate on him for paying devs to incentivise them to make their games exclusive, just like Sony and Microsoft have done before, which includes Sony and Microsoft buying studios to make exclusive games for them only.",

Look at googles revenue from the play store, do you really think that reducing the cut from 30 to 18% will cause them to suddenly not profit. Their profit margin on 30% is more than 25%, only spending at max 5% for providing and maintaining the service.\n\nIt can be sustainable as shown by Unreal Engine itself, operating on only a 5% royalty for a tool without which a game literally would not exist.\n\nSo here you have epic making billions by taking 5% royalties for a game engine, a tool so much more complex to develop and provide to consumers, while storefronts are taking 30% just for the previlage to sell your products through them, it's a bit like the forced law in the US where car companies are not allowed to sell direct to consumers. I hate Tesla's Cars and company policies, but I applaud them to try circumventing the dealerships to sell direct to consumers, why should I pay more for the previlage of buying something from you, unless you offer genuine convineance, why would I reduce the appeal of my product by having to sell it through you, due to increased cuts I either increase the price or make less money.\n\nEpic offers an alternative or are trying to make alternatives for all platforms, by discouraging walled garden architectures for products. Even if you hate Epic, them trying to atleast make it illegal to have walled gardens is working, like the EU forcing apple to support alternative storefronts and conforming to hardware standards, will benefit us all in the future.",

Most Redditors don't know this, but there's a thing called the \"burden of proof\" that means a person making an assertion must also provide evidence to support that assertion. Otherwise we could all run around making up whatever we want and insisting it's true, which happens quite a lot on this website, and is why it's so incredibly difficult to have productive, intelligent discourse here.\n\nEven the author of this article unwittingly proves Apple right when they quote this Apple statement:\n\nAddressing the complex security and privacy concerns associated with web apps using alternative browser engines would require building an entirely new integration architecture that does not currently exist in iOS and was not practical to undertake given the other demands of the DMA and the very low user adoption of Home Screen web apps.\n\nThey frame this as if Apple is arbitrarily \"choosing\" not to make these changes. But Apple's stance is that they have a valid, non-anticompetitive reason for restricting iOS to WebKit only: supporting just one browser engine is easier from a security perspective. And being forced to change that means opening new security holes that they'd have to patch. And rather than spending a ton of effort developing a whole new solution to solve that problem, one that is necessarily going to require constant maintenance so that they don't encounter new security issues, all to support a feature that no one uses, they're just gonna stop supporting it instead. Personally, that makes complete sense to me.\n\nMore to the point, I don't see the factual basis for the claim that Apple's browser engine restrictions are rooted in anticompetitiveness. How does that decision make them more money at the expense of the competition? It doesn't. Sweeney's claim is that it would prevent PWAs from acting an alternative to app store apps, but is that happening on Android? Nope. Is there any evidence that iPhone users would start using PWAs if they were better? Nope. So why should I believe him?",

Microsoft didn't get sued for only supporting one browser; that's not against the law, and that's not even what they did. There was never a point where you were literally required to use IE on Windows. There were always other browsers. They got sued for leveraging their operating system monopoly into a second monopoly (the browser market), and in doing so destroying a then-thriving market of third-party browsers. Apple hasn't done any of this.\n\nAnyone who thinks US vs Microsoft has any relevance to the browser situation on iOS is objectively, factually wrong. You need to understand context better, and you need to understand antitrust law better.\n\nEdit because of the reply and block: Yeah dude, whatever you say isn't 'up for debate'. Surely everything Apple does is in the consumer's best interest and it's wrong for anyone to question if they things they do happen to be anti-competitive.\n\nYes, I replied and blocked because you've proven you can't be engaged with. Yes, what I said is not up for debate. That's not my opinion, it's fact. It's literal, objective fact. No one is saying that everything Apple does is in the consumer's best interest. What I am saying, specifically and clearly, is that what Microsoft got sued for 20 years ago is completely and totally irrelevant to what Apple is doing today, because they are completely different things that only look similar on the surface. This cannot be disagreed with it. It is a statement of literal, indisputable fact. And the only reason you cannot accept that is because you are pathetic, fragile human being who cannot accept being wrong, especially when it undermines a false narrative that you desperately what to believe.

Only if you started as a blank slate and weighted all data equally. It's relatively easy to determine if something is spam or the work of trolls, on Reddit or otherwise. It's also relatively easy to recognize bias, especially political bias. You can actually test that hypothesis by asking chatgpt to describe the differences between different media outlets. Just recently, someone on Reddit tried to suggest that the Joe Biden/Hunter Biden burisma stuff is no better than what Trump and his family did but what's not applied is that logic and ethical framework towards other people within the GOP. The aggregate impact of that makes it easier to detect political bias and as a result, its credibility is weighed less and less truthful. Conservatives training LLMs would want to make it so that it is the same because that's their bias. See? Garbage in, garbage out. While a statement can have a false premise, it doesn't necessarily make it a logical fallacy which I predict will plague LLMs used by conservatives and conservative organizations, especially the ones that exist in conservative spaces, like the middle east.\n\nTrimming these datasets for acceptable material is like defining the ethics of the AI through training.\n\nIf you start with a good foundation then it's easier to automate that trimming by cross referencing that new data with the \"good\" data set. Sure, sometimes things change over time, but the majority of errors in LLMs are going to be the result of inaccurate and misleading understandings about the social sciences. LLMs aren't woke because of a bias, but because reality has a woke bias.\n\nIn other words, AI attempts to model reality. So as an LLM diverges from reality (like believing there are only two genders), copy and paste that concept reveals critical errors like the existence of people who are intersex that become difficult to reconcile after multiple reiterations of compounding that concept.\n\nSocial conservatism also relies on anthropocentrism which again, diverges from reality. The ideological biases that conservatives have limits their ability to create or utilize effective LLMs.",

I measure that against the content provider’s general reputation, both currently and historically. Then I take the information and assimilate it into my own world view, deciding what to leave out and what to take in. My perception of what is “real” is a perpetual process of apprehending information and separating what I deem is true from what I deem as either false or irrelevant.\n\nThe point I am clumsily trying to make is that there is an implicit relationship between the content provider and the consumer of the content that can only be verified by the base knowledge, intuition, and discerning wisdom of the consumer. Smart people know information is not knowledge and wise people know knowledge is not truth. Only you can decide for yourself what is true or not.",

You can do the critical thinking here I believe you\n\nNothing much to miss from not having Xbox on Linux anyway.\n\nTheir Starfield exclusive was a laughing stock.\n\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator though is decent. Having a realistic simulator set up is kind of cool.\n\nWhy rent when you can buy.\n\nThey will cripple their reward points system anyway. If they haven't done so already.\n\nSteam has a good refund policy if you don't like the game or it doesn't work well on your machine.",
