        "comment": "in what ways would our priorities and economies be altered?\n\nI read a paper written by an economist maybe 20 years ago now where they did a comparative analysis of the knowledge economy and basically surmised that people store a wealth of generational knowledge and information over the course of their lives and that when they die that knowledge is lost. Therefore they concluded that if people lived longer any economy would see much greater economic productivity; people would live better lives simply because the retained knowledge would improve lives.\n\nNow of course this depends highly not so much on how much longer people live but rather how much longer they live healthy lives..\n\nRight now we already see live being extended in western economies but the primary issue is that people living longer are still seeing many age related health issues and those issues (primarily heart disease and diabetes due to poor diet and exercise) are actually costing the economy more money and reducing overall productivity. There is additionally the issue of cancer which is the 3rd biggest health issue which does not relate so much to lifestyle so there is that to contend with as well.\n\nCoupled with robotics to do all the routine labor...what would happen to the birth rate, existence of money, resource allocation and the like?\n\nHuman populations act like ecosystems. Idk if they ever taught you this in school but when I went they did a simple lesson where we had little cutouts of rabbit and wolves and you would add them and remove them based on a specified birth rate and then also you would have the wolves \"eat\" the rabbits based on a certain required rate of consumption. If there werent enough rabbits then you would remove wolves (they died from hunger). The point was to demonstrate how the ecosystem of wolves and rabbits in terms of population would swing back and forth but always settle within a range over time.\n\nHuman populations do this as well. The human population will expand such that resources allow this expansion. There is no absolute infinite amount of resources despite what anyone views on AI/automation, etc are. There is a finite amount of sunlight supplying the earth with energy and there is a finite amount of heat dissipating ability for the earth so there is a finite population number that the earth can support. It is definitely some larger number than what it is today but how much that number is is up for debate.\n\nSince there are finite resources there is going to be money. We really need effective post scarcity of everything people want. eg even if we have effectively enough food and housing for everyone we wont have effectively infinite Hermes handbags and if we did women wouldnt desire them they way they do now; they would want whatever other handbag was in limited supply and that necessitates some form of currency with which to find a market price that balances supply with demand.",

I shudder to imagine how much stasis and empire building would occur with people working for dozens of decades...\n\nYes, older, more experienced people have a ton of knowledge (I was one of them), but my observation has been that after a certain age, healthy or not, creativity, risk taking and innovation plateau. Nature's solution for making sure species have the flexibility to adapt to change, to grow, to take full advantage of the environment, is aging and death- the old making way for the new.\n\nEven if we were somehow able to freeze aging when people were still biologically young, there are the problems of how much mental growth would still occur, and what do you do about youth and their opportunities? Do the young have to wait for hundreds of years to be able to take up the positions of influence and power?\n\nIf there is such a thing as benevolent AIs, perhaps they would become that force for continuity of knowledge across generations, if/when we learn to work alongside machine intelligences.",

You have your last birthday party and lay down your head for the last time peacefully ....\n\nAI\n\nIf all humans knew that every single one of us dies at exactly the same age, it would have a profound impact on our world. Here are some possible ways our world might operate:\n\nShift in Priorities: Knowing that everyone has the same lifespan could lead to a shift in priorities. People might prioritize experiences, relationships, and personal growth over material possessions and wealth accumulation. The focus might shift towards making the most out of the limited time we have.\n\nIncreased Empathy: The awareness of our shared mortality could foster a greater sense of empathy and understanding among people. Knowing that we all have a finite amount of time could lead to a deeper appreciation for the value of human life and a desire to support and uplift one another.\n\nCollective Action: The knowledge of a fixed lifespan for everyone could encourage collective action to address global issues. People might be more motivated to work together to solve problems such as poverty, inequality, and climate change, as they realize the importance of leaving a positive impact on the world before their time is up.\n\nReduced Fear of Death: If everyone knew the exact age at which they would die, it could potentially reduce the fear and anxiety associated with death. People might be more accepting of their mortality and focus on living a fulfilling life rather than worrying about the inevitable.\n\nChanges in Healthcare: With the knowledge that everyone dies at the same age, healthcare systems might shift their focus from extending life to improving the quality of life. Resources could be allocated towards preventive care, mental health support, and palliative care to ensure that people have the best possible experience during their limited lifespan.\n\nCultural and Religious Shifts: The concept of a fixed lifespan for everyone could challenge existing cultural and religious beliefs about life, death, and the afterlife. It could lead to new interpretations and philosophies as people grapple with the implications of this knowledge.\n\nOverall, the awareness of a universal, fixed lifespan could fundamentally change how we live, interact, and prioritize our time on Earth. It could foster a greater sense of unity, purpose, and appreciation for the preciousness of life.",

That has incredible value but it's not true innovation. If anything it can be used as a tool to for humans to progress faster but that's assuming AI doesn't create an environment that stifles innovation, and AI has a good chance of doing that when working within the capitalistic model and dividing the haves from the have-nots.

People's intuition about this has been very, very messed up.\n\nI think the jobs most likely to be replaced are professional jobs, considering ChatGPT4 can pass the bar, the medical exam, and it can write (quite competently) in any coding language in seconds.\n\nMeanwhile there hasn't and won't be a \"plumber\" robot for a much, much longer period of time. Same for construction workers, and a whole host of other examples. It's just way more difficult to design machines that can actually physically replace humans (vast majority of low skill jobs are Labor jobs) than it is to design LLMs that can do everything a professional does in seconds and do it better (<<give this latter part another year or two. 4.0 is pretty amazing so I suspect 5.0 to be so good I would literally rather have it as a coworker than another human being. 4.0 is already close to that.)\n\nSo you're wrong to focus on low skill labor being replaced, because that's often more manual labor, and that will be replaced long after many, many professionals have been replaced, like lawyers, for example.",

The last two times it has been below 8% was immediately before Covid, and at and following the economic boom of the 1990s, from 1999-2001\n\nThe long term U6 is just below 11%\n\n2) The part about calculating inflation is utter nonsense. It is factually incorrect.\n\nFor example the most commonly cited one, the CPI, includes in it's formula:\n\nThe rent of primary residence (rent) index and owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence (OER) index measure the change in the cost of shelter for renters and homeowners,\n\nand\n\nWhen food items that are sold on a unit basis but lack a labeled weight are being priced, two items are weighed to permit calculation of an average weight for the item. This helps reduce the variability in size that occurs among individual, loose items and is not overly burdensome for the data collection process. For example, if the item being priced is red delicious apples, and the price is 50 cents each, the BLS field staff report the price of one apple and the combined weight of two apples taken from the produce bin. In computing the price per ounce, the combined weight is divided by 2, and the 50-cent price of the Red Delicious apple is divided by this average weight.\n\nThe closest any of that comes to truthfulness is that the CPI does exclude used cars more than 7 years old. which is likely an artifact from when the average age of a car used to be less than 7 years (1980s and earlier) compared to ~12 years today.",

One is the Producer's Price Index which is costs for businesses and is only used by economists or people interested in behind the scenes prices. You'll basically never see a headline calling this inflation.\n\nThe other four are the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), and the Core version of both of those. CPI and PCE are trying to measure the same thing, they just have a, slightly different formula. Most notably housing prices are very hard to measure and they have slightly different ways of doing it. If you see a headline saying \"Inflation is 3.4%\" or whatever then 99.9999% of the time they're quoting either PCE or CPI. These include all of the things you mention.\n\nCore CPI and Core PCE remove food and energy from the mix. Food and energy prices tend to be volatile so removing them gets a better view of the stickiness of inflation. Core inflation does include both rent and used cars. Core inflation is sometimes reported in the media, but only in conjunction with regular CPI or PCE. Regular CPI and PCE are a measurement of what has happened. Core CPI and Core PCE are important to predicting what inflation will look like in the future.\n\nI have never seen anyone use any inflation measure except those 5.",

If we did, almost every job (if not every job) could either be replaced or at least improved by computer systems that currently exist between traditional automation, AI and robotics.\n\nI literally spend most of my work hours talking to other roles about their processes and 9 times out of 10, they're working at maybe 10-20% efficiency compared to if they had tools which could've been made with technology from a decade ago.",

That being said it's from what is basically a specifically upgraded distribution center to another. Drivers still are in the truck the whole time and still maneuver at the beginning and end as well as unhook and attach trailers and back them into doors.\n\nThis is the literal best case scenario for AI driven trucks. No inclement weather 90% of the time. Basically a straight route with very few turns. No way to fuck up generally.\n\nJust the first two weeks of January almost the entire US has winter storms. Good drivers know their limits and when to shut down. Manufacturers can't even get cruise controlled trucks with sensors to stop slamming on brakes while going under overpasses. How do you think that'll go if that happens to an AI driven truck in inclement weather.\n\nWhat about doing pre trip and post trip inspections out on the road? Inspecting irregular tire wear or damage? Or possibly a giant air leak that locks the trailer brakes? Overheating condition? Big oil leak? Or worse, a hazmat spill? What about a refrigerated trailer going on the fritz, AI can't fix that quickly, there goes 44k lbs of beef. What if the load shifts in the trailer causing the trailer to lean heavily to one side? Ice and slush covered sensors? Truck driver doesn't need sensors to see. Does the AI know what a runaway ramp is? When to use one and how to identify one? They don't all look the same. The AI also can't see a leaky wheel seal, that's a fire waiting to happen.\n\nNow any of these dealing with long term maintenance I can see people writing off as, \"the company shop can fix it when it comes back\". Have you guys ever seen how big corporations treat their semi trucks? Most are sold by 500k miles when even the manufacturer says 80% or more should make it to 1.2 million miles with only regular maintenance. They're sold because they don't do all that regular maintenance and don't wanna deal with the repercussions. Truck drivers can push these companies to deal with the issues, even legally by driving to a weigh station, explaining the situation and having the DOT officers put the truck out of service til problems are fixed. An AI will not do that.\n\nNone of this even gets into flatbed, or backing into a dock inside caves, or maneuvering in NYC traffic or any of the myriad of other difficult driving conditions on the road. Our highways aren't all sunshine and rainbows. AI won't be able to make them much safer for at least a few decades IMHO. Even then, you'll still need someone in the truck like you need a pilot in an airplane.",

Having a set of \"drone operators\" somewhere who could take control would be a way around that.\n\nFor example of an edge case, I have a hard time seeing the vehicle be able to understand the directions of flaggers / police are directing traffic around an accident or construction especially if it involves sending them through what isn't a typical travel route like a parking lot (or as I once personally did -- through a hay field!) Then there are the edge cases -- what if someone trying to direct traffic is an early arriving bystander who isn't wearing a reflective vest but is doing the right thing to safely move traffic out of the way / keep them from becoming part of the accident; does the car obey them? If it obeys them, why wouldn't it obey hand signals from any random person it sees at any time?\n\nNow automation and safety, yep they still have a ways to go like not braking for bridges but I do think you'll continue to see good progress on that type of stuff for reducing the danger from distracted or tired/impaired drivers.",

I mean the math is right there your sentence.\n\nMost countries citizenry outnumbers it's military 250 to 1 or more, but you don't see citizens winning wars against professional armies. Quality usually overpowers quantity.\n\nAI is not free, and will still need people to run it, to develop and train it, to improve and customise it. To review its actions and check for errors. Yes, unskilled or low skilled labour will be automated away, but high skilled labour is hard to replace.\n\nAlso, in some cases, AI will empower the little guy and free them from greedy corporations. For example, AI can easily replace a crappy writer who lacks creative, language proficiency and efficiency. It cannot replace a master storyteller, though. It can replace an editor and will eventually do so to the publisher, but the core delivery will still need a smart and creative human being. That person won't need to share his or her income with writers, publishers, agents and distributors. The corporations that do these things will all be hit harder than a talented writer. But yes, the sub-par writers will be rendered obsolete.\n\nWestern countries will be the first to be hit hard with job losses as wages are high there. In India, it's cheaper to hire 200 white collar workers than to license most corporate software, so people in low wage countries are relatively safe. I know it sounds unfair, but ask yourself why an American worker should make 10 times the average Indian or African worker for the same amount of work. You will find the answer to your last point there. If the 99% make life difficult for the 1%, the latter will just pick up and leave. They will take their jobs and money with them, and your loss will be a other poorer nation's prosperity. And there's nothing anyone can do about it. You can't fight AI, but you can learn about it and benefit from it.\n\nMost people won't like what I just said, and while I'm not endorsing it, that doesn't make it any less likely to occur. This is the age of investment and automation. There will soon be better jobs as people are reskilled, but the transition will be difficult for some, as was the industrial revolution.",

But that being said, no jobs means no consumers, and I think corporations are smart enough to figure that out with time.

My company buys all sorts of fancy tools but is unable to use them effectively, so they still need their workers to do everything manually. To use a crude analogy, it's like buying a self-driving car and then walking alongside it on the road be because you're unable to fit in the driver's seat. And thus has been the case for over a decade.\n\nMy company can also replace all its writers and designers with GenAI tools, but they're unable to come to a decision on the legal ramifications of copyright infringement resulting from the same, so they have the tool but still use writers and designers to do it all the old fashion way.\n\nAt a previous company, I once automated my whole job by writing scripts to do everything I once did manually. After I left, they went back to a manual approach because they couldn't understand how the scripts worked. This, too, was a tech company.\n\nMost companies aren't well-oiled machines with bleeding edge technology. They're slow, lumbering giants that take a year just to course correct by a couple of degrees. And by the time they usually do, things have already changed so fast that they need to course correct again. And the cycle repeats.\n\nAI will change the workplace one day, but inefficient adoption and delays will likely give us enough time to adapt so the job market can create new roles faster than old ones are replaced.",

I work in film and AI and when I say that gpt3 can do better, I'm not trying to insult him. It legitimately can do a much better job. And gpt4, with prompt engineering, and back end fine-tuning...it actually produces work that's 1000 times better than someone whose been writing for a couple of years.\n\nThe community of writers just don't realize it, yet, because businesses are still developing the best methods to get the best out of current AI. But AI needs zero machine learning innovation right now to do a better job than most amateur screenwriters. It just needs backend work, which has already been solved, to be implemented into the right user friendly app before they all understand this.\n\nRight now, most of their experience with Ai is with chatgpt but they don't understand that what they're working with is clay. Open AI invented the clay but businesses are building the tools to shape that clay into precise replicas of whatever the user wants. So I get a bit of a laugh when I hear a writer say, \"Ai sucks at writing stories.\" No, no, no my friend. You just don't understand what you're working with or how to utilize it properly. I've seen it with my own eyes. It's coming this year or early next year, but writers are going to have a rude awakening.\n\nI think AI will replace writers but that just means writers will need to learn how to produce, market, sell, and build valuable things directly to an audience. Writers who only write under contract for someone else's vision is out the window. So there will be a great shift resulting in a booming creator economy full of people who used to only write or only make films or only do gaffing for rich people. They will be more like solo entrepreneurs utilizing their skills in writing to produce stories but in addition they're going to need to turn those stories into end deliverable content that's more engaging and allows for direct monetization.",

We go from how do things function inside a cell, in relation to other cells around it, in relation to the organ or tissue it's in, in relation to all of the rest of the body, in relation to its environment, and what could go wrong along every step of the way, and how they all interact when one of many things go wrong. In my opinion, we're many exponential discovery steps away from immortality. All of these steps require lots of experimentation, which is time-consuming, difficult, doesn't really scale, etc.\n\nThe funny thing is that I think that the major hurdles will not be scientific, but ethical, bureaucratic, and financial. It currently takes at least 10 years (when it's fast) and a billion+ dollars to get anything on the market. We will probably have to try a couple of thousand things be on our way to mortality (just a guess, could be much more).\n\nI'm not saying that it will never happen, but I think that the timelines I see here sometimes are not realistic.

And if there’s nothing to replace moore’s law in time, even that is gonna stop, so pretty soon we might not even have better electronics anymore.",

Even if you could extend your life indefinitely by artificial means, your brain would most likely have issues keeping up. Memory takes up space, and your brain isn't infinite. Most older people have trouble keeping up with changes in society and the world.\n\nSo the more apt question is \"what would people be willing to sacrifice in hopes of extending their life?\" Their memories, developed skills? Take into account there's no telling what part of your brain does what (edit: at least to this level), so regenerating stuff in your brain would happen at random. You might lose your childhood trauma, or you might lose the years of therapy you had to cope with it.\n\nJust living longer of becoming immortal is a cool research project to have (to understand life better), but applying that science to humanity is a pipe dream. I'd wager anyone would just opt for euthanasia at one point or another even if they were excited to live beyond their natural lifespan when they get the treatment done.",

        "comment": "The first aspect that I would consider is what the cost is to the individual to have those procedures.\n\nFinancial cost: if it is expensive then the rich will be the ones that benefit. I can see people here suggesting that businesses would pay for it and you would pay them back or work for them for decades but I simply don’t see any business committing to a decades long relationship with anyone when that individual could simply go bankrupt and void some or all of the debt. They also would never want the people working for them as the power to fire someone is a necessity in case they need a scapegoat.\n\nThe lifestyle cost: at present there are vast lists of things that each person could do to increase our lifespan on average, reduce numerous health risks including our dementia risk. In practice, very few people do very many of those interventions and I cannot say that I have met/heard of anyone doing it all. That is partly due to lifestyle factors that cannot be controlled (e.g. hours spent working so you can’t home cook all your whole foods meals or fit in enough exercise etc). However, equally, those who are rich seem to be just as unable to meet all the requirements (though it is easier to eat home made whole foods when you have a personal chef). Again, I would say that the rich would be the ones who would be most likely to benefit as they have the most control over their lifestyles.\n\nSide effects cost: if the procedures are unpleasant or cause distasteful side effects then I don’t think that uptake would be very high by many people. We can see from the impact of medication side effects that there are limits on what people can/are willing to endure. If it causes impotence then I can’t imagine it being very popular at all. So, only those who have a strong desire to live for an extended period of time (perhaps sociopaths or megalomaniacs) would commit to it long-term.\n\nSo, most likely the wealthy and those who are desperate to live for as long as they can would be the only ones to access the services. Consequently, wealth would become even more concentrated in the hands of a very few people.\n\nIf it somehow had no meaningful costs then overpopulation would become an urgent issue in the countries that engage in it and most likely forced sterilisation at birth would be required (with births only allowed under very strict circumstances). How that would affect the psyche at a population level I don’t know but I can imagine that it would have a big social impact.",

China has over 500,000 electric trucks on its roads already and is adding more daily. Meanwhile there are rounding error numbers of trucks with hydrogen and other alternatives to batteries and electric motors. The test has been run. Battery electric won.\n\nThe USA’s transportation blueprint and hydrogen strategy are both based on broken assumptions and bad faith efforts to justify hydrogen, driven in large part by Congress forcing the authors to give the US fossil fuel industry a future. Similar problems exist in Europe, where they are intending to build a massive hydrogen pipeline effort assuming hydrogen will be shipped to ports like Rotterdam for use in transportation and heating applications.\n\nBut these efforts to perpetuate the hydro in hydrocarbon will crash on the shoals of physics and economics, the Scylla and Charybdis of hydrogen for energy. Just as with everything else, the future of trucking is electric.\n\nOther than this there is a full analysis of trucking electrification and its challenges specific to the US.\n\nPlease reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1acv978/all_trucks_will_run_on_batteries_filled_with/kjwx33n/",

That still leaves 30% of the long haul loads, but there’s no reason to let perfect be the enemy of good.\n\nAdditionally, as we focus and transition that 70%, more charging infrastructure and innovation will happen and it will make the remaining 30% that much easier to solve.\n\nThe only constraint is battery production, and to some degree cost.

Putting a battery fire out with the amount of batteries a truck will need, where to cut vehicles if the jaws of life are needed. There’s alot that needs to sorted out before we just electrify trucks.\n\nLastly, the amount of trucks that will plug in at night to charge would be a massive constraint on the grid.

He does nothing but denigrate cheap available means of energy, but instead says\"electrify everything.\" He also sides with Blackrock on China being a good investment. I wonder if it's because most of the lithium batteries he touts are made there.\n\nAn oft-mentioned challenge in this electrification shift in trucking is the tradeoff between payload capacity and battery weight. Unlike their diesel counterparts, electric trucks need to carry sizeable battery packs, which contribute to the overall vehicle mass and therefore affect payload capacity.\n\nTesla touts that their all electric tractor can have a range between 300-500 miles. That is not a great range considering most diesel tractors have a range of 900-2000 miles on a full tank of diesel. Since electric trucks are more heavy than diesel tractors that means less freight per load. That would also mean you need more trucks and more drivers, which in turn means more wear and traffic on highways. What are highways paved with? Asphalt, which comes from oil. What kind of tax will then be implemented on electric charging stations for road maintenance funding? Where does this electricity come from? Well about 60% of US power produced comes from fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and petroleum).\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/electric-trucks-longhaul-batteries-tesla-heavy-cargo-weight-problem-2023-2#:~:text=A%20semi%2Dtruck%20including%20its,total%20weight%20of%20the%20truck.\n\nhttps://medium.com/the-future-is-electric/soros-is-wrong-on-china-blackrock-is-right-41910c508441\n\nhttps://luxresearchinc.com/blog/the-payload-problem-in-heavy-duty-electric-trucking-is-not-all-that-big/#:~:text=An%20oft%2Dmentioned%20challenge%20in,and%20therefore%20affect%20payload%20capacity.",

That is not a great range considering most diesel tractors have a range of 900-2000 miles on a full tank of diesel.\n\nThis is where a distinction of first mile/last mile trucking and middle mile/long haul trucking is important. BEVs may not have the energy density (yet) to be competitive in long haul and this might be one of the cases where hydrogen's properties actually do make sense in a vehicle.\n\nWhat are highways paved with? Asphalt, which comes from oil\n\nThis is not the gotcha you clearly think it is. Asphalt emissions are not the problem and are nearly 100% recyclable\n\nWhat kind of tax will then be implemented on electric charging stations for road maintenance funding?\n\nProper taxes would be by vehicle weight and miles driven. You're targeting EVs because you have a massive chip on your shoulder.\n\nWhere does this electricity come from? Well about 60% of US power produced comes from fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and petroleum).\n\nThis is called the long tailpipe myth https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_long_tailpipe\n\nIn a lifecycle analysis of ICE vs BEV vehicles using the average energy mix in the USA, you will find that BEV vehicles account for only 30% of the emissions. It also helps that any emissions that do happen are away from population centers instead of on roads. Also the energy mix is getting greener by the day. And finally even in a 100% coal energy mix, EVs are cleaner that gas cars.",

It may be 30-40% cheaper per kw/h up front.\n\nThis would be sufficient to electrify a lot of trucking without excess mass.\n\nBut battery swapping is preferable as charging can be less aggressive, and the system can smooth out periods of peak demand and soak up local renewables. It will be the fastest recharge so can allow medium sized packs for increasing payload fraction of total vehicle mass, raising trucking efficiency to around that of current trucks.\n\nBattery swapping with >500wh/kg batteries has a lot of synergy with renewables generation in out-of-town locations. For example, distribution depots and recharging stations can be co-located with agrivoltaic parks + taller wind turbines near highways.\n\nSo this approach can improve the financials of rural renewable electric generation and avoid much of the transmission and distribution costs.",

It means lots of batteries just sitting around, very expensive swapping stations, and because of the limited swapping stations, longer wait times than if you just charged. The contracts around the batteries are also really tricky, as you cannot own a battery, but you do something along the lines of renting or leasing.\n\nHOWEVER...\n\nFor trucking this could work. Batteries could be managed much like trucks are, so that they are only sitting around while actually charging. The batteries belong to that particular trucking company, so no real contract problems. The places where swapping is needed would be known well in advance and could reduce the amount of stations needed and the wait times.\n\nSo for cars, swapping is stupid, but for trucks it might already be a good idea.",

Install a large diesel-powered generator where the cab was, electrically drive the wheels… hell, electrically drive the trailer wheels, because it’d make for better acceleration, braking, and overall control, and just let the system keep going. After all, in the last hundred years, we have never found a better way to run trains than this, but we’ve never been able to do it with trucks, for lack of space. But, if you tear out everything that’s geared toward the human, now you’ve got room for it, and you’re not losing a bunch of energy to heat or inefficiencies in the mechanical system. It’s exactly the same as running your local power plant on petroleum and then putting that in a battery.

The world’s largest EV battery manufacturer, China’s CATL, started manufacturing and shipping a battery with twice the energy per unit of weight as the ones in Tesla’s trucks and cars this year. It’s initially focused on the electric aviation market, but will be selling it for road vehicles in 2024. The 450 miles becomes 900 miles on a single charge, and the over 1,000 miles one of the Semis traveled in a single day on its rounds potentially increases to 1,500 miles or more including time at very high speed chargers.\n\nThat’s with batteries commercially available right now. Four different organizations that I’m aware of in multiple countries have overcome the technical challenges and are commercializing silicon battery chemistries. The theoretical energy density maximum is five times that of CATL’s new batteries. Only doubling it is required to provide equivalent range as diesel semis viable with a lighter tractor and hence more load.\n\nMost analyses which dismiss batteries for trucking make assumptions that batteries are not still improving rapidly on metrics of price and energy density.\n\nBut still, that doesn’t solve the system problem. We need to get electricity into those new batteries. Different countries have different rules for drivers, with the USA allowing them to drive far longer with fewer rests than Europe. Europe’s rules provide lots of time for charging as do the USA’s with the new batteries and very high speed chargers.\n\nAlso the trucks don't need to cover a journey from new York to California. In the EU you have to take 45 minute brake after 4.5 hours of driving. Same with the US but for 8 hours. The range of current Teslas are already more than the regulation limit.",

Duh.\n\n​\n\nYou must also remember lithium batteries are very inefficient compared to oil when it comes to energy generated from that mass.\n\n*spit take* What? See folks, this is what happens when people only read headlines or get their news from TikTok. What you almost *certainly* meant to say is that oil is more energy dense. This is *not* the same thing as efficiency. Not by a long shot. EVs are dramatically more energy efficient than ICE. This is really easy to look up in thousands of places, but let me know if you need help.\n\n​\n\nConsider the danger of driving around with a huge bomb strapped to your vehicle\n\nYes. This is why combustion engines (you know: the ones driven by actual explosions?) are very dangerous and catch on fire over 10 times more often than EVs. Also, EVs are not harder to *put* out, but require a different technique to keep them out.\n\n​\n\nOur electric grid is a joke and has no way to support a massive change into fully reliant electric vehicles. Any attempt at change will take decades.\n\nI'm very sad to hear you talk so poorly about your country. But I have good news for you. The costs involved to get your grid completely EV-ready is only a few percentage points above what is already needed for planned expansion and maintenance. It's not a big deal.\n\n​\n\nElectric trucks for anything but short haul won't happen anytime within this generation\n\nWell, over 50% of all trucks are short haul, meaning less than 100 miles. So that is already a big piece.\n\n​\n\nSemi trucks have weight limits\n\nWhich are already higher for electric trucks *and* most trucks are not weight limited, but space limited.\n\n​\n\nno company wants to sacrifice massive profits for a large portion of that weight to be an expensive battery.\n\nFunny thing about profits. It turns out paying more than twice as much for your fuel eats into them as well.\n\n​\n\nThis forum loves to exaggerate shit\n\nWell, the pot and kettle thing is pretty worn out, so let me try: this is like a mime accusing a clown of not being funny.",

A truck full of Pepsi probably would be much heavier.\n\nBig question is then what proportion of truck travel is between warehouses up to a couple hundred miles? Deliveries from a rail station to the surrounding city?That’s still a lot of trucks taken care of and a lot less for alternate systems or heavier batteries. More random longer trips will stay liquid fuel for much longer but maybe fuel is cheaper as demand gets limited to these harder to change scenarios.\n\nThe numbers and practically isn’t actually too bad once infrastructure is in place. Which still has a long way to go but then what other alternative infrastructure is ready to go? Charge while docked and fuel savings would be substantial and could make up for say a 10% payload reduction. Consider that your also ripping out a fair weight of engines and gearboxes to replace with battery weight. Then substitutions of diffs and final drives for electric hubs.\n\nIt’s not as far away as I once thought, even if initially limited to corporate fleets on suitable routes.",

Everything comes down to cost per mile and a freight rate to cover that. And what parts would be more expensive to repair once the technology matures? Engines and gearboxes are not cheap to overhaul or replace. And ultimately electric motors are good enough for trains, I’m sure they would work in trucks.",

Battery electric won.\n\nThe USA’s transportation blueprint and hydrogen strategy are both based on broken assumptions and bad faith efforts to justify hydrogen, driven in large part by Congress forcing the authors to give the US fossil fuel industry a future. Similar problems exist in Europe, where they are intending to build a massive hydrogen pipeline effort assuming hydrogen will be shipped to ports like Rotterdam for use in transportation and heating applications.\n\nBut these efforts to perpetuate the hydro in hydrocarbon will crash on the shoals of physics and economics, the Scylla and Charybdis of hydrogen for energy.

The vans which run from a local distribution center to homes and businesses. There BEVs are increasingly popular, and for a good reason.

The world’s largest EV battery manufacturer, China’s CATL, started manufacturing and shipping a battery with twice the energy per unit of weight as the ones in Tesla’s trucks and cars this year. It’s initially focused on the electric aviation market, but will be selling it for road vehicles in 2024. The 450 miles becomes 900 miles on a single charge, and the over 1,000 miles one of the Semis traveled in a single day on its rounds potentially increases to 1,500 miles or more including time at very high speed chargers.\n\nThat’s with batteries commercially available right now. Four different organizations that I’m aware of in multiple countries have overcome the technical challenges and are commercializing silicon battery chemistries. The theoretical energy density maximum is five times that of CATL’s new batteries. Only doubling it is required to provide equivalent range as diesel semis viable with a lighter tractor and hence more load.\n\nMost analyses which dismiss batteries for trucking make assumptions that batteries are not still improving rapidly on metrics of price and energy density.\n\nBut still, that doesn’t solve the system problem. We need to get electricity into those new batteries. Different countries have different rules for drivers, with the USA allowing them to drive far longer with fewer rests than Europe. Europe’s rules provide lots of time for charging as do the USA’s with the new batteries and very high speed chargers.\n\nAlso the trucks don't need to cover a journey from new York to California. In the EU you have to take 45 minute brake after 4.5 hours of driving. Same with the US but for 8 hours. The range of current Teslas are already more than the regulation limit.",

If it's a large truck stop with lots of room, they could even consider a wind turbine.\n\nDoing this will avoid expensive grid upgrade costs (they could still trickle-charge the battery from their current grid connection if needed), and then they are both the producer and seller of the electiricty, so they're not paying a margin to the electricity company.\n\nSolar and batteries are on a strong declining cost-curve too, of course.\n\nTL;DR: A lot, or all, of this extra ~11% required could actually end up delivered via new solar and grid-battery installs, and not tax the grid at all, while also being cheaper/more profitable for the truck stop",

        "comment": "The following submission statement was provided by /u/Maximum-Leadership91:\n\nPepsiCo’s innovative approach to sustainability is exemplified by their integration of Tesla’s Semi trucks into their fleet, showcasing a blend of technological advancement and environmental responsibility. Their Sacramento distribution center is a hub for these electric trucks, which are primarily utilized for shorter delivery routes within a 100-mile radius, demonstrating their operational versatility.\n\nThe Tesla Semi trucks stand out for their efficiency and long-range capability. They have a maximum range of 500 miles per charge, a feature that was put to the test when one of the trucks impressively covered 1,076 miles in a single day during a rigorous testing process. This achievement was made possible by alternating two drivers over 24 hours, thus maximizing the truck’s operational potential.\n\nFeedback from drivers who have operated the Tesla Semi trucks has been predominantly positive, especially in comparison to traditional diesel trucks. Drivers have reported a more comfortable driving experience, easier handling, and superior visibility from the truck’s cabin. These benefits are further complemented by the truck’s regenerative braking system, which has proven to be a unique and efficient feature, especially on routes with significant elevation changes.\n\nPepsiCo’s commitment to a sustainable future is further underscored by their goal to eliminate emissions from their operations by 2040. This ambitious target is supported by their significant investment in electric trucks, including one of the largest orders of Tesla Semi trucks, signifying their dedication to reducing their carbon footprint.\n\nTesla’s role in this transition is crucial as well. The Tesla Semi, still in pilot production, is a pivotal part of Tesla’s strategy to revolutionize the electric vehicle market. The production of these trucks, set to scale up following the expansion of Giga Nevada, marks an important milestone in the evolution of electric freight transport. As of now, Tesla has produced approximately 100 electric semi trucks, many of which are operational in PepsiCo’s fleet.\n\nThe partnership between PepsiCo and Tesla in deploying electric Semi trucks is a powerful example of how corporations can leverage emerging technologies to meet environmental goals while maintaining operational efficiency. It’s a testament to the potential of electric vehicles in transforming the logistics and transportation industries, paving the way for a more sustainable future​​​​​​​​​​.\n\nPlease reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1acudwa/tesla_semi_is_worlds_only_electric_freight_truck/kjwqpj1/",

The tractor just uses model 3 motors directly driving the rear wheels. The end result is that that the tractor might be a couple of thousand pounds more than a regular tractor.\n\nAnd before you go off about 'all that matters is max weight!'. You are wrong. Trucking is not about weight. No really. It's about the cost of moving goods per mile per pound. That is all any warehouse manager cares about. The electric trucks are simply way cheaper to operate per mile. Even paying a driver to pick their nose for a half hour is cheaper than dumping $300 of diesel into your tank. That is where the electrics will eventually win.\n\nAlthough that hinges on affordable rapid charging and Tesla's promise of cheap charger power due to the grid batteries may be a lie.",

Those designs were very aerodynamic and what limited them was the cargo. Those rather beautiful 1940's trucks taught us that a specialized streamlined trailer has very limited use on a truck. You can have a hyper aerodynamic truck but if you're hauling things that aren't it's wasted effort. I mean even something as common as a stackable shipping container would be a disaster for this vehicles mileage and given how much is shipped in those things makes this not all that useful.\n\nThe Labatt's streamliners aren't the best example due to their bunt face but oof they're beautiful trucks.",

Their Sacramento distribution center is a hub for these electric trucks, which are primarily utilized for shorter delivery routes within a 100-mile radius, demonstrating their operational versatility.\n\nThe Tesla Semi trucks stand out for their efficiency and long-range capability. They have a maximum range of 500 miles per charge, a feature that was put to the test when one of the trucks impressively covered 1,076 miles in a single day during a rigorous testing process. This achievement was made possible by alternating two drivers over 24 hours, thus maximizing the truck’s operational potential.\n\nFeedback from drivers who have operated the Tesla Semi trucks has been predominantly positive, especially in comparison to traditional diesel trucks. Drivers have reported a more comfortable driving experience, easier handling, and superior visibility from the truck’s cabin. These benefits are further complemented by the truck’s regenerative braking system, which has proven to be a unique and efficient feature, especially on routes with significant elevation changes.\n\nPepsiCo’s commitment to a sustainable future is further underscored by their goal to eliminate emissions from their operations by 2040. This ambitious target is supported by their significant investment in electric trucks, including one of the largest orders of Tesla Semi trucks, signifying their dedication to reducing their carbon footprint.\n\nTesla’s role in this transition is crucial as well. The Tesla Semi, still in pilot production, is a pivotal part of Tesla’s strategy to revolutionize the electric vehicle market. The production of these trucks, set to scale up following the expansion of Giga Nevada, marks an important milestone in the evolution of electric freight transport. As of now, Tesla has produced approximately 100 electric semi trucks, many of which are operational in PepsiCo’s fleet.\n\nThe partnership between PepsiCo and Tesla in deploying electric Semi trucks is a powerful example of how corporations can leverage emerging technologies to meet environmental goals while maintaining operational efficiency. It’s a testament to the potential of electric vehicles in transforming the logistics and transportation industries, paving the way for a more sustainable future​​​​​​​​​​.",

You'd mostly have a barrier to keep idiot kids from bumping into it.\n\nThe teenager will see the fly land on your burger, shrug and flip anyways. The robot simply won't notice it and innocently flip it.\n\nThe teenager can notice it 'smells funny'. And then either do something about it or not. The robot has no idea. Any sensors will clog. Optical systems can't be too sensitive because grease and smoke will get the lenses dirty, so bug detection is out.\n\nOverall, it's a wash. But the robot company will make $ by selling them a new disposable fire resistant food grade robot sock every day.",

Our population numbers simply cannot support the latter case for everyone, so reasonably dense development is the obvious solution. Attempts to have our cake and eat it too, mostly in the form of car-dependent suburbia, have been an utter disaster: we ended up getting the disadvantages of both and the advantages of neither.",

Do you think there are labor shortages anywhere or is construction just somehow special and there are plenty of high skill workers to fill the jobs? The facts are:\n\nThe workforce in construction in the early 2000's was VERY old. It was so bad people weren't retiring when they should because they didn't want to leave their company hanging out to dry. They would semi-retire. There are literally high profile non-profits started around this problem.\nAlong came the 2008 housing crisis of \"too many\" homes and we simply quit building. We built as close to zero homes as is possible to do in a country the size of the US. We didn't really build many more each year as we recovered. In 2019, we still were not back to the level considered a healthy amount just to service population increase.\nDo you think all these older workers just sat around and waited for housing to come back? No, they retired, went into other fields, etc. No one hung around.\nThen the pandemic hit. Most of the labor they were able to attract back between 2010 and 2019 just threw up their hands and retired for real this time. Across ALL industries those that could retire did and the baby boom generation was pretty much out of the work force. There were a LOT more of them than the genX so there simply wasn't anyone to replace them. Have you noticed the Walmarts aren't 24/7 anymore and restaurants have a bunch of empty tables because they don't have enough staff to service them? I can't go to a pharmacy from 12:00-1:30 because they are so short staffed they just close them down now.\nPeople don't want to work construction. It's hard physical labor with a high risk of being injured. It's highly skilled work that requires a lot of experience to do efficiently.\n\n\nBut don't take my word for it, just go look up anything on it. Here is the first article that showed up on Google which says there is roughly a 650k worker shortage. See if you can find one that says there isn't a shortage.",

        "comment": "I think in the near term, life is going to get more painful, but in the long term we are going to see a real estate collapse. Right now, there are huge incentives for ever increasing home prices.\n\nHome owners want increasing home prices, landlords want increasing home prices, local governments want increasing home prices, real estate agents (the NAR is among the highest in spending for lobbying) want high home prices. So as long as you are fixed into your home or you stand to make more money from high real estate costs YOU have a very, very big incentive for housing to get far more expensive. These are by and large all people who run local governments.\n\nIf housing costs doubled, that would be good for a lot of people. And those people are in charge of policy. Its extremely common for city council members to be landlords and when they oppose some building project, they have their own financial incentives for doing so. By limiting construction, the supply remains low, the demand remains high, and the rent they collect from their investment properties remains very high! You have many people, people who generally have money, who all have a common incentive to make housing as expensive as possible. These people have no issue using the government to achieve these goals. Government helping them is NOT socialism. Its just good business because it makes the more money!\n\nWe need enormous amounts of housing in high demand areas where the jobs are. Not 2 hours away from the jobs and expect people to drive 40,000 miles per year to commute. I am from a Southern California city called Riverside, its a commuter city for Los Angeles and Orange County. LA/OC have the well paying jobs and every day about 30,000 people from my city make an hour+ drive to go drive to work. Living in LA/OC and a home will cost you a million (and this is not a fancy home). A comparable home in Riverside will cost you $600,000. If you can't afford the million dollar home, you do the whole commute thing. You can go much further east and find something for $450,000 but now you are looking at at least 3 hours of driving each day.\n\n​\n\nHere is my optimism. Location is the most important thing. Locations with high paying jobs like Silicon Valley (where I am now) are extremely expensive. However, we are witnessing the early stages of a remote work revolution. COVID accelerated it by several years, but it was going to happen anyway just due to technical improvements. We have yet to see the first wave of major startups that are built around a remote work force vs requiring their employees to all move and live in the most expensive area in the country. This eliminates geography as a major advantage that certain markets have. People will be able to get a high paying job while living anywhere they want.\n\nI really think that rural markets and small towns with cute downtown centers are going to use this as leverage. Make a place that is really great to live and attract remote workers. Someone making $100,000 per year, not very good in San Francisco, someone making $100,000 per year in small town Indiana, very good! Especially if that person is already from Indiana and didn't really want to move.\n\nAnother one that will affect housing supply in high demand areas is the transition to Self Driving Taxis over private cars. The big thing, all that land downtown used for parking can be repurposed into high density mixed use. Tony Seba from ReThinkX estimated that if you took all the parking lots in the City of Los Angeles, the area freed up would be 3 times the size of San Francisco. The land that parking lots currently use could house 2+ million people at San Francisco density (San Francisco has parks by the way...) . As I mentioned, I live in a commuter city, our real estate prices are not justified by local wages, but by commuters. Plop down housing for 800,000 households, and make it cheaper than Riverside pricing, and now those commuters will move close to work.\n\nI am going to kind of bring this back home...\n\nDowntown Riverside is more than 30% parking infrastructure. If people are using RoboTaxis to get around, this land used for parking becomes obsolete, and the owners of that land would make far more money if they developed it into high density mixed use development. Downtown Land owners will want to turn their Downtown 2 acre block into something that would make the largest possible income for them, that is going to be high density, mixed use. Throw up a few dozen shops/offices, and then 450 housing units and they are going to make an absolute fortune. Letting valuable land sit vacant isn't a great way to make money.\n\nWe are not even the worst in the area. About half of Downtown San Bernardino is used for parking. Some developers are going to figure out that building massive amounts of urban development in this area is going to make them a lot of money, especially if by the nature of the design they can make it much safer than the surrounding area.\n\n​\n\nSmall towns all over America are surprisingly quite large. They are just spread out and poorly developed. They will have huge gaps between destinations. They will have enormous amounts of land used for parking. There are 16,000 small towns in America. Turn their central downtown area with 2,000 housing units (going high density this can fit on 20 acres) and that would be 32,000,000 housing units popping up all over the country. A lot of these can attract remote workers who want to live in a nice community full of urban amenities but at some small percent of the cost.\n\nDes Moines Iowa has 1.6 million parking spaces, for 220,000 people. 7 parking spaces per person. 28 parking spaces for a family of four. RoboTaxis show up to Des Moines and now the demand for that excess parking is going to drop off sharply. Turning the area into a cool urban area can bring hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nRight now, and for the last several decades. Residents compete for who gets to live in communities. Governments don't have to attract residents. That could very quickly change and the incentive structure could become one where local governments have to compete for residents, because those residents bring in tax revenue. If you remember several years ago, Amazon announced they were going to build an HQ2 and asked local governments for bids. The local governments all wanted those high paying jobs in their city (even if its not local labor, its a lot of tax revenue and economic activity). Go back and look at what governments were willing to do. They were going to give away the farm for some juicy tech workers. However, these governments are now asleep at the wheel when it comes to remote workers. They can now attract the workers without attracting amazon.\n\nThis housing crises that we are dealing with, it will be disrupted. From remote work jobs allowing people to be divorced from geography for employment to a major redevelopment of every downtown core in the country.",

In short, you can think of it as the \"productivity\" of a location. Cities have high rent, wilderness has low rent.\n\nLand rent is intrinsically tied to a location, and its value is always being collected if the land is in use. Whether by a landlord, a corporation, a homeowner, or the government. If we let a single private entity own all the land, they could essentially turn us into slaves. The so-called \"cost of living\" is the cost of allowing private land speculation.\n\nHaving the government collect the land rent effectively turns the public into one big landlord that subleases our land out to individual users. If we redistribute that revenue as a UBI, it effectively shares our land equally. Each citizen should be able to afford a piece of land of equal value, and thus the \"cost of living\" would be offset by the UBI. Any money you earn would be used to improve your standard of living (e.g. food, shelter, government operation, luxuries...)\n\nHow will this affect me? Under a LVT:\n\nPeople who own an average amount of land (e.g. a primary residence and some stock) will come out neutral.\nPeople who own a below-average amount of land (e.g. renters) will come out ahead.\nPeople who own an above-average amount of land will come out behind (e.g. landlords, major stockholders in companies with land.)\n\nLand value tax is not property tax. A property tax considers the market value of the land and the improvements (capital) built upon the land, which disincentivizes building/ownership of buildings. LVT merely disincentivizes leaving land unused. Land is defined by Henry George as \"all natural forces and opportunities.\" Anything we didn't make. It includes land, water, air, sunlight, radio bands, hundred-year-old equipment, etc. So technically it's a bit more broad than just land, but our housing issues arise from literal land. You can imagine, though, if we allowed private companies to \"own\" our air and rent it to us... it would be a problem.\n\nThe book (Progress & Poverty) lays out a lot of concepts more rigorously, but some interesting observations arise from this analysis:\n\nUnder a properly adjusted LVT, the market value of land should fall to zero. In fact this is one way of knowing we set the rate correctly for a given plot. Imagine if the cost of buying a house was actually the cost of the house!\nHomelessness tends to be worse in cities because the demands of the location require people to be highly productive. The stakes are higher, and if you slip up, you fall behind very quickly.\nImproper setting of rent is a likely cause of recessions. The rent is a number independent of what a landlord asks for their property. If the landlord asks for a low number, the renters are happy and the economy booms. If the landlord asks a number higher than can actually be produced from the location, labor is not worth performing and capital is not worth investing despite the availability of both. In return, consumers have less money, less stuff gets made, and that lowers the productivity of the location even further. If any financial vehicles were created on future rent... those are now worthless. It all collapses until landlords reset their expectations of rent and the economy can get going again. Weirdly, since requested rent is being set by lots of different owners/sellers (some smarter than others), economic booms/recessions can be highly regional.\nThe game Monopoly is loosely based on George's ideas.",

When Parker Brothers first published Monopoly in 1935, the game did not include the less capitalistic taxation rule, resulting in a more aggressive game. Parker Brothers was eventually absorbed into Hasbro in 1991. The game is named after the economic concept of a monopoly—the domination of a market by a single entity.\"\n\nBasically the version of the game that showed that the current capitalist system sucks and will lead to monopolies managed to become the surviving and popular one.",

Reasons: • Prefabs are banned in my region. Only brick homes are allowed and should you be caught owning a prefab, it needs to be demolished. • old brick homes (like really old from mid 1800s) cost a fortune to be renovated. • renting a small apartment costs 500€ a month for 2 bedrooms and even though my job could allow it the taxes and bills just don’t make it possible. • buying a new house sets you back half a million for 3 bedrooms or a quarter if you only need 2 bedrooms (and we’re talking about apartments. Single homes are just out of the question) • only one house was available for less than 100k but it’s a repossession from the bank and nobody goes after it for obvious reasons (a family still lives there).\n\nIn the end, I’m staying at my own apartment that my parents bought and built prior 2020 for me but living with your parents next door with your wife isn’t the best when they’re overprotective and cause more harm than good.",

Europe needs immigrants but is absolutely terrible about dealing with them.\n\nImmigration to the US from Latin America (of which 80% have been Mexicans) over the last 70 years has had its social and economic issues, but in the long run has saved America from a demographic collapse. The type of Demographic collapse that would destroy the country in the long run.\n\nLook at Detroit. At its peak, Detroit was one of the wealthiest cities in the world. In 1950, Detroit had 1.8 million people. Then there was a consistent drop in population every decade, now down to 620,000 people 70ish years later. Investment halted, infrastructure costs became too expensive, the people who were educated and skilled left the country. They didn't go from a poor city to a poorer city, they went from a wealthy city to a poor city, to a poorer city, to an even poorer city.\n\nThat is going to be a likely future of Germany and Italy. They stopped having kids 40 years ago. Those kids grew up, and had even fewer kids. Those kids are going to grow up and have even fewer kids. The old people in society all require a lot of healthcare and other services, services that have to come from somewhere. All the public infrastructure and industry, it requires a population to maintain, that population goes away, and so does the ability to maintain it.\n\nYou know who isn't having this issue? The United States. We have enough young people to keep pushing forward, and we are great at bringing in more young people to boost up our numbers. All those young Germans and Italians who will be living in a collapsing nation, we will make room. Just like the young people who left Detroit.",

Non-individual investors include limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, trustees for estate, real estate corporations, and Real Estate Investment Trusts, among other corporate entities. **The growth in non-individual ownership has been greatest for small- and midsized- multifamily properties but was also evident for single-family rentals.**\n\nIndeed, 25 percent of single-family rentals were owned by non-individual investors in 2021, up from 17 percent two decades earlier. This explains how investor activity in the single-family housing market has increased even as the **number of single-family rentals has declined in more recent years.**\n\nSo why is there more owned, but less rented? Because of inheritance laws.and people like me.\n\nI don't own my home, the Family Trust does. It also owns all of our investments, and is the beneficiary of my 401K and Life Insurance.\n\nThat way my death, or our deaths, don't leave our son saddled with a huge tax bill when we die. It won't be like when my wife's grandparents died within 48hrs of each other and the taxes on the house on the house meant it had to be sold or there would be no cash money for her under aged mother and brother to live on.\n\nSo it is not as bleak as it looks, and now with some fiscal constraint on easy money it will correct itself as homes go back on the market to provide liquidity to corps like Blackrock,",

Anyways, hopefully this generous serving of waffle at the beginning of my comment will help with the auto moderation process. What I was originally saying was that in my opinion, the only way out of this housing crisis is going to be the 3D printing of dwellings. it’s possible to print the base structure of a dwelling in under 24 hours for around $10,000. For a country like Australia that has a lot of land, this could be a real game changer, disrupting the current real estate model. And really, the housing crisis is because of greed and turning something that should be a human right into a commodity. So all those folks that own multiple properties, might just choke on those aspirations…",

They are culturally homogeneous. They have not encouraged a lot of immigration. I guess I wonder whether having an older population and fewer young people will be a problem before long?

Increased population concentration in cities that offer better prospects. People want to be where the good jobs are. 4. Old people - older population means wealth is concentrated in people who need passive income in retirement - especially in countries like the UK where state pensions are a joke. People then buy multiple houses to finance their retirement. 5. Lack of supply - we’re not building as much as we used to due to too many regulations. In the 50s and 60.
