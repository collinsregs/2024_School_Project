They lose a whole source of income. If the money goes to everybody it‚Äôll probably result in a 200-500 dollar tax return increase versus if it goes to the people who have lost their jobs due to implementation AI, it would likely be close to enough for them to survive on while looking for another job.\n\nThe reason why people lose their jobs because of AI is because their skill sets are no longer needed. This makes it extremely difficult for these people who are willing to work, but unable to due to their skill sets becoming obsolete, to replace their lost jobs.\n\nTax returns would be beneficial and would definitely work great in the future, but that doesn‚Äôt solve the short term problem of people being laid off right now. To add, there are certain sectors that are currently not using AI in their industry, and it simply wouldn‚Äôt be fair for those people to benefit off of AI. Overtime as AI begins to take over more sectors and lay off more people is when we can slowly spread the benefits of it.\n\nObviously my solution isn‚Äôt the best solution because there are a lot of holes of what qualifies as ‚Äúlost jobs due to AI‚Äù. But I merely suggested it because I thought these benefits should be directed to these people who desperately need them right now.",

A senior administrator position was 55k a year and their excuse was ‚Äúyou‚Äôre making competitive pay for the area.‚Äù Yeah the college town you made me move to because the average pay is 20-30k entry level positions.\n\nBeyond that the company was scummy as shit. They had promised the city they‚Äôd bring in a certain number of workers in exchange for tax breaks and incentives to be there. Instead they hired remote workers and contractors and placed their name cards on empty desks. Whenever the city would come by for a census, they were ‚Äúout sick that day, but here‚Äôs their desk‚Äù. No one has sat there for 3 months!\n\nOntop of that you could set your watch by the layoffs that happened regularly like clockwork. CEO takes a multimillion dollar bonus but we can‚Äôt afford 33% of the employees in your office. We regularly had grief counselors come by because people were getting laid off so regularly.\n\nThe words ‚Äúraise‚Äù or ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù were taboo. I was one of three people to get one in the entire building while I was there.\n\nLongest day I ever worked was at IBM totaling 27 hours straight before I finally went home to sleep then got a call 3 hours later complaining that I wasn‚Äôt on a meeting.\n\nIBM has been reduced to a sweat shop that treat employees like cattle. Once you‚Äôre burned up and can‚Äôt give anymore, they lay you off and find a new cow.\n\nWhat‚Äôs incredibly sad is that it was an awesome company in the 80s and 90s that actually treated their employees well. Then greed took over and everything went to shit.\n\nTo this day, I believe IBM takes contracts and customers they never intend to fufill because paying penalties and losing brand integrity is cheaper in the long run as most companies will just write off the loss when IBM fails to deliver.

The new award program simplifies this and now you get $1300 for every patent filed, but the plateaus and point system, along with the associated awards are gone.\n\nIt actually is a net positive if you just look at the dollar amounts. If you filed 4 patents previously, you'd get $4250. With the new system, you get $5200. Plus there's no waiting for that 4th patent to get that extra money.",

Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[6][7] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.",

Changed love to like and moved on.\n\nYears later looking back, it is important to not only set work boundaries with your time but also with your words.\n\nSo now when I instnctivly say I'd love to do that, or I'd love to hear more - I stop myself and think.. no I dont lol. Its fake talk and takes away from the true meaning of the word which I save for few people.\n\nIdk, soap box moment. But made me think of that.",

Etc. etc. The corporate spoken line of \"Id love to do that for you, but please submit XYZ paperwork\" IS VERY DIFFERENT from telling your wife that you love them while hugging them in a romantic moment. Tone and intention matters. The words aren't sacred and don't really hold the weight. The feeling you give someone when you say something is really what's being transferred.",

They always get a budget approval to increase the pay of a position to \"recruit new talent\"\n\nSo why not just increase current employee's wages then? Reliance on exploitation. Budgets often do not get approval to just give current workers higher wages. The entire HR performance review system is often stacked to make sure no one gets raises. Have you ever been part of a review system where everyone needs to land on a 2.5 or 3 out of a scale of 1-5? That's a stacked deck against you. It's fucked and if you want to fuck the system, get a new job every 2 years to assist in generating high turn over rates.",

I was let go because they already had \"put up\" with the first leave, but after I had the audacity to go out on the second leave, that was too much!\n\nI was quite stunned. But it was early in my career and I hadn't learned the ways of the world yet. heh\n\nThere are some cases where companies act better than that. The one I work for now has extensive paid parental leave for both parents, great health insurance, and I have seen what happens when people are in positions that are eliminated: They try to place them somewhere else in the company. There are other good indicators that I don't want to go into, but while no place is perfect, it's worth working for a bit less pay than I could get elsewhere because the people I work with are almost all great, and I know that I'm not just a cog.\n\nThat said, even here, I know that at some point in the future, things could always change. But I'm hoping to retire from this place.\n\nIf you do get lucky enough to find a good place, it's worth trying to hang out there. Especially as finding work gets harder and harder.\n\nBut 99% of places just suck, and you need to find a new job to get any bump in pay. Don't worry about those companies. They'll survive. Or not.

Sure, it definitely wasn‚Äôt because he had the most experience on his team and was therefore the most expensive‚Ä¶\n\nThis all after the CEO personally called him after he was hired to deliver a speech about how the company is investing in him bringing him onboard and they‚Äôre looking for a long tenure from him. Really laying on the guilt and talking about how the company is a family, the usual BS.\n\nThe cherry on top? They let him go just before his probation ended so they could avoid paying severance AND our first child is due in two months.",

You're in constant conversations with legal teams, policy teams etc. and balancing differing laws around your designs. Then there's translations for the native country you're working in, so can't slip up with language that doesn't translate well. The timelines are unforgiving because it's government policy, so delays aren't an option - makes everybody tense af. It's also the most scrutinized part of social media, and one of the areas that tends to go viral. That happened to me in a project I was involved in for another country.

Aside from the lack of meeting the numbers thresholds, it's also not an action driven by facility/plant closure, business hardship, or the temporary nature of a project. It's driven by performance, and is therefore a non-layoff termination where the employer seeks to end the relationship. This is important, because a layoff by its nature means the employer does not actually wish to end the employment relationship, but are being forced to due to being unable to support employee role as it stands. Jobs lost by layoffs are also not meant to be refilled right away (if not a temporary layoff, and even that means the laid off employee gets right of first refusal when the position reopens), and if an employer \"lays off\" an employee and immediately hires someone new for the same position, then a wrongful dismissal suit may be an option for the old employee.",

Companies will drop you without notice and without consequences.\n\nMy advice to you, work for a few years and gain experience and network and then look for the next opportunity. No point in staying long term unless the company offers some sort of pension.\n\nI worked for a company for 10 years, and I went from $40K to $55K. I decided to leave due to the fact that there was limited upper mobility. Next job paid $65K and I stayed for two years and was making $70K at the end of the two years. Then I left that company when an older manager decided to bring me on to his team at a new company and I was offered $100K. I pretty much doubled my salary in two years time.",

A couple weeks before I had my quarterly performance review with my boss. I was told then that I fucked up because I concentrated on doing the thing I was told to do on my previous review and didn't do the stuff they told me NOT to do on the previous review. All of my previous performance reviews were fine.\n\nI was laid off during a 10 minute meeting with my boss's boss where she told me it was performance related and that I would be receiving NO severance after 5 years on the job. Later on, I found out that several hundred people were let go at the same time and that nearly all of them were told they were being let go for performance issues, and they were all told they wouldn't receive any severance.\n\nThe company must have heard from someone's lawyers because a few days later, we all received emails stating that even though we were definitely let go for totally legit performance reasons, that we'd all be getting severance. They had told people who had worked for the company for 10 and 15 years that they sucked and weren't getting any severance.\n\nTurns out the entire thing was just so they could shed enough employees to force the rest back into the office. We had previously been told that we'd NEVER have to go back into the office on a regular basis and the company had even given up its lease on one of the towers we worked in. The new CTO decided we all had to return to the office and the fact that there just wasn't enough room was the actual reason for the round of layoffs.\n\nRemember kids, HR is never, ever, ever, ever your friend. They only work for the good of the company.",

You could start off with a song then it would slowly \"drift\" away from that song based upon what others who chose that song liked. Then, once you rated songs it made a web of songs that listeners like you might like. The important bit is that it slowly tried to weave in different shit from what you're used to, but not too different.\n\nI feel like the YT algorithm has its idea of what IT wants me to watch, not what I want to watch. So much of the stuff presented on YT is trash that doesn't remotely fit my personal \"drift\" level. Then you go and watch one random video and suddenly it thinks you're into that content forever.",

Add some more clickbait words and so on. Or search for specific spoilers for a show you've seen, and block allll of the channel which stupidly spoil the spoiler in their title/thumbnail, can't have them spoil something I haven't seen yet later.\n\nTho after a while you notice that there is A LOT of junk channels.

Do it again a week later and there's more worthless channel that were created. I am at like 1500 blocked channel.",

Google is useful only for the most basic of searches that may be tangently related to something they can serve you an ad on: \"Is store open? Where store? Is celebrity dead?

The advent of AI is only downgrading everything, from the quality to the language used. Hell, I even hate the structure that they have all similar and boring. Google let this be and now there is no more original content or nobody is incentivesed to enter or start a blog with original ideas just for fun anymore.\n\nThis is why the best results are now found in subreddits (but the management will find a way to slowly destroy it).",

The card unlocking is fair too, yes, it take sometime and money can only you make progress faster but you can collect all cards just by playing and enjoying the game. Plus, the game has no energy system.",

It's infuriating when I can't find a specific video from a niche channel uploaded 6 years ago even though I know the exact title, before:2025 helps",

The search feature is janky, and it just feels like good information gets lost in the shuffle of conversations. Especially when people don't actually use the threads feature (which IME they usually don't). So if you have a question and try to search a discord for it, you have to individually check out each of the results to find where that subject was discussed before, hope your question was actually answered, scroll through a whole bunch of irrelevant jokes and memes, only to find out that the topic changed before someone gave the information you want.\n\nThe upside is that if the discord is active enough, you can get an answer in real time just by simply asking again. But sometimes I don't want to chat and just want to be able to passively browse lol.\n\nAnd my biggest gripe is that it's hard to keep track of all of the servers themselves. I just pruned my list and still have like 20 of them that I need for various gaming communities and friend groups. And now they exist for other hobbies and groups beyond gaming? It's just too much without a way to better organize them.",

This is a positively staggering figure.\n\nGoogle has happily been laying the groundwork that AI companies use for years. They realised that since they were already scraping every website fully for SEO purposes, that they could just siphon off the actual content and stick that in the search results page.\n\nIts a real \"snake eating its own tail\" thing though because websites just became increasingly desperate and/or just gave up. 60% of the their traffic (and climbing daily) just vanished entirely. If there's no more people clicking through from a search results page, nobody is going to opt in to being indexed by Google.\n\nThe issue is that people don't just want information. They actually want content. Or products. Or services. Google can't do that.\n\nAs an aside, my personal bugbear with Google and AI is how they have been increasingly ranking AI generated content that clearly fools a scraping robot, but is absolute garbage to read. The worst thing is that it takes a bit to figure it out, so Google's looking at me stumbling about on some AI hellscape trying to figure out what the fuck is wrong with what I'm reading and going \"oh great, this must be a really good website since he's been on here for so long\".",

Secondly, the news publishers maintain control over the content on the AMP pages, including with respect to decisions about what ads to display and where to display them on the AMP pages.\n\nThe news publishers can also choose which ad network(s) they want to use for displaying ads and Google does not take any cut of the ad revenue from the AMP pages unless the news publisher decides to use Google Adsense as their ad network (in which case Google would obviously take their normal revenue split).\n\nAMP is supposed to be a win-win for Google and news publishers. It results in much faster page load times (and better mobile user experiences) and it results in much lower web hosting costs for news publishers while still allowing the publishers to maintain control over the presentation of their content and the ads displayed alongside their content.",

It sidesteps the need for expensive infrastructure.\n\nThe continent's energy requirements are expected to increase considerably in the coming decades.\n\nAn additional investment of $30 billion a year is required.

Arce says no such requirement exists.\n\n\"An attack only needs to be able to send packets on that network,\" he said. \"Also, the proof of concept code which we provided to all vendors, including Microsoft, does not set up any server.\"\n\nQuarkslab Chief Research Officer Iv√°n Arce\n\nAnd what's executing the PoC on the network, magic dust particles, or perhaps a computer that's serving those packets like... a server? Jesus.\n\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, issued a statement that said the company was taking ‚Äúappropriate action,‚Äù without saying what that was.\n\nWell... they can update the UEFIs on the hardware they sell and ask other vendors that they do the same, it's not like they can do anything else.\n\nUnfortunately pretty much all UEFI implementations are closed source so this is going to be affecting a lot of hardware (every x32 consumer device since 2011~ at the very least) that's never going to see fixes for it.\n\nFortunately people usually don't end up in PXE unless their existing system was unbootable.\n\nTL;DR * Does this affect me -> Not really * Should I update UEFI if an update is available -> Yes * How do I do that -> Support page for your mother board or device is going to have an update under BIOS/UEFI/Firmware section somewhere * You will probably need to be running Windows or have a FAT32 formatted flash drive, depending on the UEFI implementation. * Refer to device/motherboard manual if in doubt. * My device is 2011+ but I only see BIOS updates -> You have UEFI. You can either have UEFI or BIOS, they are mutually exclusive. Your vendor is most likely incorrectly labelling the download and most likely does it in other places too",

Everything from multimodal add ons to agents, it is amazing what the community has done and is still shipping on a daily basis.\n\nMany of them are things large orgs/co.s just can't try because it's too big a shift from their current business models and a big ship is hard to turn due to bloat, org restrictions or internal politics (usually the big bois just wait and then buy up these small bois later)\n\nSo no, 1 bedroom boy can definitely give legacy co.s (that aren't even in tech) a run for their money and either disrupt a older business or get a nice exit when a larger tech player buys them out.\n\nThe idea that you need the very best experts and infinite resources is completely out of date when it comes to AI.

You and I probably agree that this statement is not hyperbole.

Basically, OpenAI's gearing up to tackle election misinformation big time. They've updated their policies to stop misuse of tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E for sketchy stuff like impersonating candidates or messing with election info. They're also integrating this digital credential thingy in DALL-E images, so it's easier to spot if an image is AI-generated. Major players like Microsoft and Adobe are in on this too. Plus, AI tools will point voting queries to CanIVote.org for legit info. But hey, it's still a bit of a wild west with AI, and a lot depends on users flagging bad actors. The article wraps up with a solid nod to media literacy - basically, don't believe everything at face value and double-check those too-good-to-be-true posts. So yeah, that's the gist of it. Pretty neat stuff OpenAI's doing, but it looks like we've still got to keep our critical thinking hats on! *",

Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[6][7] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.",
