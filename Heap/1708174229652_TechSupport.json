If you accidentally drop your phone in water, it's less likely to sustain immediate damage thanks to these advancements. It's crucial, however, to avoid leaving your device submerged for extended periods. Additionally, exposure to saltwater can still pose risks to your phone's functionality. Apple's testing shows that iPhones can withstand immersion up to 6 meters for 30 minutes, as detailed in their support documentation (https://support.apple.com/108039).\n\nRegarding the dark spot on your screen, it's probable that it resulted from dead pixels, a common issue after applying heat. While there's a good chance this problem won't spread, replacing your screen is a viable solution. However, be mindful that a screen replacement could potentially compromise the original water resistance of your device.",

If wireless and you can do wired try that then make sure your computer networking is connecting at decent speeds...\n\nIf you can time a file transfer between two devices in the home and do some rough napkin math to figure out speed of that thansfer - eg if you transfer a 10Mbyte file and it takes 1 min that's 80Mbits in 60s (there's 8 bits in a byte and files are rated in bytes while network speed is in bits) sooo that would be about 1.3Mbits/s. (windows will also give you a rough transfer speed)\n\nIf you internal transfer is a lot faster than out to the Internet it's less likely to be an internal issue\n\nAnd wireless will be slower than wired",

The CPU is set up to look for RAM in another slot, but it doesn't mean that the manufacturer actually bothered to install one on the motherboard.\n\nSo make sure to check before buying anything.\n\nAs for adding extra RAM:\n\nAdding 4GB has the highest chance of working.\nIf you add more than 4GB, it will run in \"flex mode\", if it's supported.\nFlex mode means (in your case) that the first 8GB (4GB + 4GB from each set) of RAM will run in Dual Channel mode (faster), and the rest will run in single channel mode (slower, as it's only available on the added module).\nIf it's DDR4, then it's likely that flex mode is supported. On DDR3 in laptops it's a bit more hit/miss.\nYou need to find out what type (DDR3/3L/4/5), frequency and timings your internal RAM is running at, and get something that is similar enough.\nYou want a module capable of same or higher frequency and same or lower CL timings. This is because it will be forced to run at the same settings as are used for the soldered RAM.",

To verify, go to where the PC will be, turn off cell on your phone and just use WiFi. Then do a speed test from Speedtest.net and see how good, or bad, the connection is. You can also load an app called WiFiman on your phone and measure the signal strength directly. Anything weaker than -70 dBm will be problematic.\n\nThe Powerline adapters others have mentioned will be your best bet if the WiFi signal's too weak in his room. Here's an article on it explaining what it is and how it works, What is Powerline?.\n\nLike any tech stuff they have their pluses and minuses. In a situation like you have though they are your best bet. At the most basic installation you run a short Ethernet cable from the router to the adapter that's plugged into a wall socket near the router. At the other end you have an adapter plugged into a wall socket and an ethernet cable from it to the PC. There are kits that add extras, like the distant adapter generating it's on WiFi signal, or a power pass through so you don't lose access to the outlet for something else.\n\nTp-Link probably has the best bang for the buck with it's adapters with basic ones in the $40-50 range.",

You could plug the dongle directly into your pc, but the (probably metal) case itself may prevent good reception. If you put a small usb cable in between, you can move the dongle around and see where you have the best wifi reception, a bit like a radio antenna.\n\npowerline adapters that output ethernet are also a thing, but a decent one may be fairly pricey. It is probably the only serious option if wifi reception is not good though, and a cheap one will get the job done, just not with the highest speeds.",

You usually only need to mess with it if you're managing several network in close proximity, where you manually assign different channels for each.\n\n20 Mhz channel width is supported by all 5GHz devices, no matter how ancient, while 80 Mhz has the potential to deliver more assuming your ISP subscription plan provides that much bandwidth and the area isn't crowded by other routers. Try 80 Mhz, confirm that all devices work, and if yes, leave it. Otherwise, try going down step by step from 40 to 20 to check which is supported by all devices.",

I just wanted to know that the time I have to dodge damage is the highest possible without moving closer to the server. My impression is that the ms ping can cause damage to hit you that you can't see. So I'll use CoD as an example bc most people have played it. In CoD there are times where you can shoot someone before they even see you rounded the corner. Peekers advantage plays into that with CoD but if i understand correctly (and i may not) ping plays into that. My thought process was if I go from 12 to 6ms then I'm halving the amount of delay between when i take the damage and when i can physically see the ability outline (on smite.)",

So, if there exists a .docx and a .txt with the same name, they'll sit side by side, and hopefully make it easier to spot.\n\nIf you want to make it even easier you could use an external diff tool, and compare dir *.docx /B /O N with dir *.docx *.txt /B /O N which should highlight the text files, and make it easier to spot missing ones. diff tool online: https://www.diffchecker.com/text-compare/\n\nLinux would use ls instead - check the man page for info - and has an integrated diff tool",

But assuming your barn is on a different power circuit, it probably won't work for that - but there's nothing stopping you testing it if you do get the replacement powerline.\n\nFor your barn, the cheapest and simplest choice is to get an ethernet cable and route it between buildings - you'll need one that's designed to go outdoors, perhaps like this one: https://store.ui.com/us/en/pro/category/accessories-cables-dacs/products/unifi-patch-cable-outdoor?variant=uacc-cable-patch-outdoor-8m-w There are wireless alternatives, but they are pricey - minimum $150 from Ubiquiti.\n\nIf a WiFi AP is providing 5GHz, it is practically guaranteed it can provide 2.4GHz.

You can try to close background apps, set your power plan to high performance. There was at least an issue with raw input (a setting in Valorant) a few months ago that, when enabled, dropped FPS significantly while moving your mouse on 1k+ polling rate mice. Disabling the setting fixed the problem. But I think some more info could help figuring out what exactly the problem is, like maybe getting an external program like FrameView to see exactly what is causing the relatively low FPS.",

So like if your router is set up to use the latest and greatest that allows up to say 100 Mbps (megabits per second), but your laptop is set up to use a protocol whose max is only a fraction, like hypothetically 1 Mbps, your laptop in this case would be the bottleneck because it is set well below the router's capability.\n\nIf you can specify your make/model of both the laptop and router it'd be easier to find specific settings you might tweak.",

For that assuming it finds one for your wifi adapter which could be outdated, it should walk you through the steps to install the newer one. That could solve the problem all by itself but the wifi frequency stuff I mentioned would still be worth checking out.

And around that have there been any changes to your wifi, specifically router or laptop network settings, also living arrangements (e.g. some appliance with wifi or just electronically noisy that you acquired that might be causing interference)?\n\nOne quick thing you can do is go into your router's web interface (read the manual on how) and change the wifi channel for the wifi network your laptop uses. If you have numerous people's wifi networks in your area all that signal congestion can also reduce bandwidth, so in that case changing to a different, less \"busy\" frequency can help (and there are apps you can download to find and assess what wifi networks are using what channels, so that you can pick a frequency range less populated to use for yours).",

Just because you get that on speed test doesn't mean you'll download at that speed.\nThe 19.9 you see in speed test is bandwidth, think of it like having a highway with 4 lanes, you can handle more cars with less congestion(relative to a 2 lane highway) but won't make a difference if your car is slow or the speed limit is low.\n\nTo better understand this, best to look up on \"bandwidth vs throughput\" and learn how they're different.\n\nTLDR; Bandwidth doesn't equal throughout speed, that throughput speed you're getting sounds about right with that bandwidth.\n\nEDIT: To download faster - upgrade your internet connection",

Dump files are crash logs from BSODs.\n\nIf you can get into Windows normally or through Safe Mode could you check C:\\Windows\\Minidump for any dump files? If you have any dump files, copy the folder to the desktop, zip the folder and upload it. If you don't have any zip software installed, right click on the folder and select Send to → Compressed (Zipped) folder.\n\nUpload to any easy to use file sharing site. Reddit keeps blacklisting file hosts so find something that works, currently catbox.moe or mediafire.com seems to be working.\n\nWe like to have multiple dump files to work with so if you only have one dump file, none or not a folder at all, upload the ones you have and then follow this guide to change the dump type to Small Memory Dump. The \"Overwrite dump file\" option will be grayed out since small memory dumps never overwrite.\n\nI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If your phone is overheating there's likely an issue with the CPU cooling which is causing the phone to shut itself off rather than burn up.\n\nThis is the same thing that happens with PC's after long periods of time. It sounds like you're probably in need of a new phone or (if possible) some fix of the CPU cooling internally.\n\nThe other reason I wouldn't disable this protection is if your phone catches fire and bursts your battery, you could very easily burn down your entire house/apartment. It's there for a reason.",

You wouldn't remove the temperature sensor of your car to allow it to run as hot as it can.\n\nYou can flash custom kernels and ROMs if you have unlocked your bootloader and they may have a different throttling pattern that prevents it to shutdown, but it will run crazy slow to not produce more heat.\n\nSounds like it's time to disassemble the phone and see what happened with the thermal interface. Perhaps it degraded and the CPU is no longer making contact with the metal heatsink",

This is most commonly seen with unstable overclocks/undervolts, but can be from an issue with the CPU.\n\nMachine_Check_Exception can be annoying because you aren't really supposed to get this crash anymore. It was virtually replaced after Windows XP by WHEA_Uncorrectable_Error. The only instances where you are supposed to still get this is if the WHEA routine (Windows Hardware Error Architecture) hasn't yet initialized or if the CPU's error record hasn't logged any errors. WHEA relies heavily on the CPU's error record and the CPU logs errors for itself and PCIe devices.\n\nSlightly off topic: The CPU errors from this are still called Machine Check Exceptions, they are just integrated into WHEA in Windows where it also manages other errors. In Linux for example, it's just called Machine Check Exception.\n\nMost of the times you see Machine_Check_Exception in modern Windows it's the CPU. The dump files from MCEs are also a rat's nest to debug in a debugger and thoroughly unenjoyable to work on for me at least.\n\nWith the BIOS being up to date I would have the CPU as the main suspect. Not necessarily faulty, though that is most likely. It could be a voltage issue from the PSU, a motherboard issue or even software (Unless you are using tools to undervolt/overclock the CPU, I can't think of any other software than the BIOS or Chipset driver).",

And yes, sometimes I think you can even to something more drastic and fully disable it manually and then force a manual reenable. If you find the \"friendly\" thing isn't doing its job well.\n\nOther things that might be happening is a high refresh panel (I didn't look up your specs). Turning that down to 60Hz (if possible) could save quite a bit of power as well. And of course, brightness (the normal things).\n\nGaming laptops are gaming laptops.

You never felt a problem with the battery itself before this, so no point on getting the 65W charger, if the components draw more than 45W, they can just use the battery anyway, and it's unlikely you use it on prolonged period to the point of draining the battery.",

It turned out to be caused by some cheap sleeved PSU extensions I was using, which hindered my components from getting the amount of power they needed. These extensions worked fine for 3-4 months, but progressively started to fail on me. If you happen to use PSU extensions, I’d advice u to try removing them.\n\nIf not then I’m not entirely sure about how to troubleshoot PSU issues. I believe there are cheap tools out there that u can buy and test if its faulty or not. If you have an older, spare PSU, u could always try to use that if you know it works. If the PC works fine using another PSU, u can instantly conclude that it’s a PSU issue.",

Tons of apps are still 32 bit because in a lot of cases there is no actual advantage to them running at 64 bit and especially apps that use plugins require the plugin to match the bitness so they would break a lot of things moving it to 64 bit. Took Office a long time to start pushing 64 bit as the default install even though it was around for a while.\n\nWhen installing a game from whatever platform it is on may give you an option when installing which version you want, or sometimes both the 32 bit and 64 bit executables are included, but the shortcut that gets created will be for the 32 bit. Totally depends on the specific application.",

Matching the timings doesn't matter because the motherboard will just adjust the clocks to match the slowest stick.\n\nWhat actually matters is getting the two sticks as identical as possible which is impossible to do by looking at a stat sheet or the purchasing page. The vendors that sell RAM don't actually make it, they just assemble it. All RAM vendors buy parts from SK Hynix, Samsung, Micron/Spectec or Nanya. You want to match the manufacturer and chipset version on the sticks (With RAM the chipset is often called the Die). Each vendor has their own tech for the chipset and different naming schemes, getting a different manufacturer drastically lowers the chance of them working together. This is also annoying even if you get the exact same model number RAM as they will change who they buy RAM from before every batch if they can get a better price from a different manufacturer. A later produced batch can be as different from an earlier one as any other random kit even though they have the same model number. QVLs will often list the manufacturer and you sometimes see the same model number kit 3-5 times on the list with different component manufacturers.\n\nThe only way of knowing this information is after you already bought it. Corsair has a sticker on the RAM sticks where it says \"Version\" and a version number which isn't actually the version, but an in-house code for who made it and which version chipset was used. For others you have to use tools to read the memory information like Thaiphoon Burner.\n\nAnother important thing to match are the ranks of the RAM. This is usually shown in the spec sheet and on the purchasing page though. It's how many memory chips are on each stick of RAM and how they are set up. Both of your kits are 1xR8 which means single rank of 8 chips.\n\nDifferent capacity can also be an issue.\n\nThis is why all RAM vendors put in small print at the bottom of the page something like \"Only sticks purchased in the same kit are designed to work together\".\n\nThen we have the issue of four sticks just being way harder on the memory controller (Part of the CPU). Some kits just won't work with four sticks no matter what you do with certain CPU and motherboard combos. If you look at the QVL (Qualified Vendor List, a list of pre-tested RAM motherboard vendors make) for AMD motherboards at least (AMD had huge issues with their memory controller on first and second gen Ryzen so I became very familiar with them because I post here a lot) almost half of the kits doesn't pass quality control when using four sticks due to instability. It will also reduce the speed they are able to pass QC with quite often.",
