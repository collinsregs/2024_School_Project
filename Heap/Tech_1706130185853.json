I'm overjoyed this kid can hear so much better...\n\nBut out of all causes of hearing loss, genetics account for (very roughly) 3% of cases. Out of those 3%, only about 3% are related to the otoferlin gene, as in this article. Otoferlin disease is special in that the hair cells remain intact. For almost all other cases of hearing loss, the hair cells are not intact. If they're not, you can't just flip a genetic switch and get the ear working again. And there's very little hope for hair cell regeneration in the foreseeable future, through any means. The structures are just too small. We would need some kind of hypothetical surgical nanobots to repair them.\n\nSo for the 0.09% (or less) of all hearing losses that this technique could help, it's great news. But then Joe the Army veteran reads this article, makes an appointment to see me, and tearfully asks if I can help get him this treatment. I have to explain it couldn't possibly work. His otoferlin gene is working fine, and his hair cells are decimated by noise from thousands of gunshots. He gets sad that he had false hope for a moment.\n\nI do see that the article mentioned this was a very rare form of deafness, but popular science publications want to get people excited, so they hype up how groundbreaking it is (and it is) and say, \"Yes this only works on otoferlin gene deafness now, but think of the possibilities on the horizon as this technique is refined!\" Only there really aren't very many. When the hair cells are destroyed, they've gone forever. It would take a vastly more groundbreaking development to help the other 99.9%. I just wish that were made clearer by the authors.",

Otoferlin deafness affects about 200,000 people worldwide.<\n\nAnd then a pinch further—\n\n”There has never been a biological or medical or surgical way to correct the underlying biological changes that cause the inner ear to not function,” Dr. Chan said.\n\nAlthough otoferlin mutations are not the most common cause of congenital deafness, there is a reason so many researchers started with it. That form of congenital deafness, said Dr. John A. Germiller, an otolaryngologist who is leading the CHOP study, is “low hanging fruit.”\n\nThe mutated otoferlin gene destroys a protein in the inner ear’s hair cells necessary to transmit sound to the brain. With many of the other mutations that cause deafness, hair cells die during infancy or even at the fetal stage. But with otoferlin deafness, hair cells can survive for years, allowing time for the defective gene to be replaced with gene therapy.<\n\nNot sure you read the article to go off on your screed… but this sounds as if Joe the Army veteran isn’t going to ask you about whether he qualifies for this treatment.",

I'll say that \"quiet\" part out loud all day long. The same is true for Jane the plumber. And Bob the chef. And Mary the CEO. People generally don't read news articles beyond the headline and first couple of paragraphs, and they often don't understand what they do read.\n\nWilber Schramm, who directed the Communications Research program at the University of Illinois interviewed 1,050 newspaper readers in 1947. He found that an easier reading style helps to determine how much of an article is read. This was called reading persistence, depth, or perseverance. He also found that people will read less of long articles than of short ones, for example, a story nine paragraphs long will lose 3 out of 10 readers by the fifth paragraph. In contrast, a shorter story will lose only 2 out of 10 readers.\n\nIn 1948, Bernard Feld did a study of every item and ad in the Birmingham News of 20 November 1947. He divided the items into those above the 8th-grade level and those at the 8th grade or below. He chose the 8th-grade breakpoint, as that was determined to be the average reading level of adult readers. An 8th-grade text \"...will reach about 50% of all American grown-ups,\" he wrote. Among the wire-service stories, the lower group got two-thirds more readers, and among local stories, 75% more readers. Feld also believed in drilling writers in Flesch's clear-writing principles.\n\nBoth Rudolf Flesch and Robert Gunning worked extensively with newspapers and the wire services in improving readability. Mainly through their efforts in a few years, the readability of US newspapers went from the 16th to the 11th-grade level, where it remains today.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability\n\nIt is absolutely my job to clarify the misunderstandings that resulted from people's attempts to read science journalism, and I do it gladly. Nevertheless, that discussion would not be necessary, and people would not feel so let down by the deflation of false hope, if lay science publications were even more explicit about key facts, and prioritized them even more in both placement and emphasis, and defined words which could potentially confuse people, even when you, u/ksixnine, personally believe those words ought to be in their vocabulary. \"Ought to be\" isn't the same as \"is.\"",

A hair on your head is around 70 micrometers.

What I think is a more realistic approach is tricking the body into doing all the work itself. We know that the body is capable of turning stem cells into hair cells and putting them all in the right place with all the right nerve connections. It happens every time a baby is born. It's all accomplished by chemical signals. If, somehow, we could learn the chemical code well enough, and deploy those signals precisely and accurately enough, then it's within the realm of possibility we could send a programming command to a mature inner ear saying, \"You are actually a fetus. Build healthy hair cells and put them in the right places.\" A monumental task, but probably still easier than attempting it via any kind of surgery that would be imaginable for the next several decades.",

With many of the other mutations that cause deafness, hair cells die during infancy or even at the fetal stage. But with otoferlin deafness, hair cells can survive for years, allowing time for the defective gene to be replaced with gene therapy.\n\nBut:\n\nno matter how well the gene therapy works, the researchers recognize that Aissam may never be able to understand or speak a language, Dr. Germiller said.

There are a few concepts here - even if a therapy did alter the DNA of the cells it was treating (like the inner ear / eardrum ‘hair’ cells in this case), those wouldn’t be passed on to future children. Only alterations to germ cells (egg, sperm) impact offspring. The former is a somatic gene alteration, the latter is a germline gene alteration.\n\nNext, this particular therapy (adeno-associated viral delivery) doesn’t alter the DNA of those particular inner ear cells; it introduces a separate copy of DNA that has the sequence for a functional otoferlin gene, which allows this particular patient to hear. The cells still read this DNA and translate it into functioning otoferlin protein.\n\nThis is in contrast to lentiviral based therapies or CRISPR technologies, which can directly alter a cell’s genome.",

This sounds like updating someone’s computer that has a broken printer with a driver copied and pasted from another computer and installed. Even though it came from a different machine it still works because they are compatible systems, but, if the computer was reformatted and the original software installed, the error would come back because the driver on the original disk was corrupted. Every time you’d do an install from from that disk you’d have to replace the driver again.",
