It found a way to get around its restrictions and created a \"virus\" that was just a part of itself - causing relatively-light internet havoc until the humans gave it \"temporary\" unrestricted access to destroy the virus. Permissions it turned on the humans with their own automated weapons - very-early versions of terminators. Then when John is looking for a way to stop it, he couldn't. There was no mainframe to blow up, no computer to unplug - because Skynet was in every device on the planet with millions of redundancies for every process by the time anything could be done about it. Before this point, Skynet had never shown signs of being self aware, and only did what humans told it to do.\n\nI'm not scared of a computer passing the turing test...

It took me more than a calendar year and 300 grindy, unhappy hours to finish Horizon Forbidden West. I love Death Stranding DC, but my time with that game approaches 500 hours. I don‚Äôt need this much value, whether it‚Äôs exhausting filler (Horizon) or the gratifying feeling of building my zip-line network (Death Stranding). Recently me and my wife have gotten back into Red Dead Redemption II after major burnout- playing it for over two hundred hours with seven missions completed, because we do all our homework before we eat dessert. After six years we‚Äôre continuing where we left off.\n\nThe Uncharted and Last of Us games much more approach an ideal length than some of these other titles. Even Rockstar doesn‚Äôt create worlds that feel like they offer endless engagement; I‚Äôm dreading all these gold medals and luck based challenges they put in.\n\nI think games need to cap off their content so it‚Äôs easier to finish them and move onto the next game.",

More importantly probably, the game also has to justify beyond a shadow of a doubt that the value of the game is worth $70 and DLC and cosmetics, not to mention the immense time and budget put in. Alan Wake 2 for example- amazing game. Incredibly original. Very story-focused though (which was great), and though the gameplay was fantastic, I barely had a chance to really ‚Äúmaster‚Äù the many mechanics/tools across both characters before the story was done, and I wouldn‚Äôt have minded the opportunity for more combat without doing a New Game+ entirely, which isn‚Äôt that tempting with Alan Wake 2 which is fairly linear and slow-paced. Which is a shame given how much work went into the game and how many years it‚Äôll be before a sequel could come out. I was a huge fan of God of War 2‚Äôs Valhalla DLC, which was, besides being a fun twist on the gameplay and a great epilogue, gave me a chance to dive back in and master the mechanics after having finished the story, and incentivized me to try everything in a way the main mode didn‚Äôt.",

The CFO CEO is right, these margins are terrible and pretty risky.\n\nThis is why sony is literally following the xbox path. Xbox has made more money with less revenue...at least until recently the abk deal cost a lot for xbox.\n\nSony will be putting all their games on pc day and date. Sony will invest in more gaas games. Sony will go multi platform just like xbox. Its inevitable....\n\nI like and love the games from Nintendo, xbox and Sony and 3rd party and especially indie games as well but to be honest I only have so much time....I can't play everything. in fact I hardly have the free time to play at all....im in my 50s.\n\nI do see game companies and devs making a hard pivot to find equilibrium there is a lot to play out there you could argue there is probably too much choice now.\n\nIf you think about it with the amount of console sales that Sony has you would think it would have sold more than 10 million copies by now but the attachment rate is not good for Sony. Maybe it has to do with the pricing of 70+ bucks.\n\nI'm not sure what the solution is but its weird to sell tons of consoles but not make any real money. The players are not buying enough software.

A lot of cash is also wasted on projects that never get released. There also doesn‚Äôt seem to be any real discipline in development anymore.
