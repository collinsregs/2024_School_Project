I worked at Xerox Office Systems Division, 1984–1986, and the truth is, Apple ran with Xerox tech while Xerox was faltering, bleeding talent! Many of us Xerox Employees were buying Apple Macintoshes in the mid 80’s (I got a Mac II in 1987!)\n\nApple made MANY improvements to Xerox tech:\n\nXerox Doodle was a really crappy paint program and nobody paid any attention to it - it was not allowed in the product! Apple wrote a much better version “MacPaint” adding textures and lasso and some slick marketing to make it look like loads of fun!\n\nOne-button mouse, Pull-down menus, and the menu bar were major simplifications that NOBODY else had. Xerox used 2-button mouses and pressing both buttons at once (“chording”) simulated a 3-button mouse. This brought up pop-up menus or did something else … when you pressed a button you were never certain what pop-up thingie might appear! Drop-down menus were a huge improvement in self-documenting user interfaces! Just being able to click on “File” if I want to do something with files is a huge win but completely LACKING from Xerox products!\n\nApple’s invented the resource fork’ed file, to save memory. The idea was to save static user-interface elements on floppy disk .. load them .. draw them .. then reclaim the RAM! Resource-forked files glued a program binary together with the user interface elements (text strings, dialogue menus, pictures, etc.) and by dropping just 1 single file into a folder you had EVERYTHING no need for an INSTALLER! Using ResEdit anyone could modify the text & pictures & menus to adapt the program for other countries. What started as a poor-man’s virtual memory system became a MAJOR advantage in installers and internationalization!\n\nApple invented the Quickdraw picture language. Xerox didn’t. There was no Interpress picture language. Apple did it before Adobe’s Display Postscript (1984). So the Apple MacIntosh could copy pictures BETWEEN PROGRAMS on the clipboard and NOBODY else could do that effectively for almost a decade!\n\nSo whenever people say that the Macintosh is stolen Tech from Xerox, I have to laugh. Some of the very best parts of the Macintosh are the Apple parts! Sure Xerox OSD invented the desktop metaphor (docs, printer icons, filing cabinets or folder icons), but Apple improved it 2x and then drove down the prices 10x and deserves more credit than Xerox!\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-say-that-Apple-stole-from-Xerox",

They failed to mention the Tesla model Y, which is obviously a vehicle people DO want since it's currently the best-selling car in the world even despite the widespread and well-deserved hatred of Elon Musk.\n\nThe article mentions also the fact that 87% of new cars sold in Norway are EV's - the fact I gave, which is true - and gloomily points to the fact that so many ICE cars are still on the road there. How ever will they fund road maintenance without fuel sales taxes as those old vehicles go away?

Combined with the environmental damage caused by battery manufacturing and the extra silicon in electric cars, the environmental benefit of the electric motor is mostly cancelled out.\n\nThen there’s the problem with range and charging. There aren’t enough charging stations, not enough infrastructure to support millions of cars charging at once, it’s takes much longer to charge an electric car than to refill a gas tank, and the range is much lower.\n\nElectric cars won’t make sense for everyone until 3 things happen:\n\nWe need major leap in solar and battery tech. Solar panels need to be AT LEAST 50% efficient and batteries need to have AT LEAST double the capacity, lifespan, and charging speed. In reality these numbers may need to be even higher. Also, the cost has to rise slower than the efficiency/capacity ratings.\n\nWe need upgraded national infrastructure to handle all that power and charging stations and an electrical grid comprised of, again, AT LEAST 50% solar (or wind, hydro, etc) power. Again, 50% is a low estimate.\n\nAn expansion in nuclear energy. Solar and wind only provide power when the sun is out and the wind is blowing. Unless there is a major quantum leap in solar and battery tech, we will always need a source of constant, controllable power and the only options for that are fossil fuels and nuclear, with nuclear being better for the environment.\n\nRight now, EVs really only make sense if you can charge it at your home and don’t take long trips (and can afford an EV).\n\nEven after we have all those things, we’ll still need fossil fuel engines for a lot of things like trucks, ships, planes, helicopters, emergency vehicles, and for emergency power. Of we had affordable solar panels that converted 90%+ sunlight to usable electricity and affordable batteries with 10x the capacity, 10x the lifespan, and 10x input/output current capacity then we could probably get close to near 100% clean energy but that is a long ways off and even once we have the tech, we still need to build it and replace all the existing stuff which would take decades even after the tech is invented and mass produced.\n\nSo no, we will not all be driving electric cars by 2035 no matter what laws we pass.",

This is their attempt to turn the Alexa division around and have it start to bring in revenue.\n\nFor me personally, I don't see the point of paying for an upgraded version. I use Alexa devices to listen to music, check the weather, and voice control my smart devices (smart bulbs mainly). If they were, in the future, to retire classic Alexa and require a subscription for the limited ways I use it, not only would I end up not buying that subscription, I would end up canceling Amazon Music.

It hasn't been tested, it doesn't have any apps (yet), and we don't even know how well it works other than very limited and controlled reviews. Yet, 80k people lined up to buy it and then bought it within hours.\n\nI know people want to hate on this product, but this is a really good sign for Apple. And this small success (but yet a success) is going to enable the next generations to be smaller, lighter, faster and cheaper. This is a great win for AR.\n\nNow let's just hope most of those 80k people are happy with it, and that all the devs that bought it are inspired to build awesome stuff that in the future we won't know how we lived without.",

They see a headset and they think games, then get angry that games aren’t the main focus… many wanting Apple to remove all of the other functionality to bring down the price so they can play games on it affordably. There are plenty of headsets made just for consuming content. This is the first viable wearable computer... that will also play games.\n\nI feel that this is similar to the first iPhone; people being outraged that a “phone” was so expensive and shouldn’t have a touch screen or a web browser. It should only make phone calls and be much less expensive. “I only want to make phone calls and Apple is dumb and will fail.”\n\nAs a game developer, I’m excited for the potential of what this can do for dev, workflow, and testing. Until now, the dream of developing content fully in AR & VR was just a dream. I have a lot of hope right now.",

They are trying to do away with words like \"AR, VR, etc.\" and instead rely on flashy words like \"spatial computing\" instead. This device isn't suppose to be for a specific use case or niche; it's supposed to be THE personal computer for your everyday needs... Apple wants AVP to be THE device that does everything from your basic consumption (movies/music/webpages), communication (email, messages, FaceTime), and even work (pages, keynote, numbers, Mac Virtual Display, etc).\n\nWhether Apple succeeds in that vision is an entirely different subject. The product hasn't been released yet but we can bet that the direction of its use case will be heavily influenced by its users and developers, not entirely on Apple themselves.\n\nWhether Apple succeeds in that vision is yet to be seen as it entirely depends on developer and customer feedback.

If a user racks up 1000 plays a month, that's just about $0.011 per play. $0.007 to the platform for servers, bandwidth, etc, and there's your $0.004 to the artist. (Ad supported revenue per stream is likely worse than this)\n\nWhile plenty of users are under 1000 plays, it's really not as much as it sounds - if you assume 4 minutes a song, that's about 66 hours a month, or ~3 hours per workday.\n\nFor it to be sustainable, the price has to go up, but really, how much can it go up before people turn back to the radio, or piracy? Maybe $15, $20 still nets more, but $50 would certainly collapse the userbase.",

This manager basically had tried to falsify company records against me so I went HAM with months of evidence of their poor job performance which left me doing basically all of their regular job (management was only supposed to comprise 20% of their job, the rest of the time they were supposed to be doing actual work), mistreatment of employees, and pattern of lying (it took me 5 minutes to disprove everything they were trying to claim against me). Got to the point I threatened legal action because a lot of what I was reporting could be construed as discrimination against protected classes, and I heard through my connections HR got read the riot act by their legal team because they had handled things so poorly and basically given me a pile of evidence to take them to court with if my job were in any way threatened.\n\nSaid lying nutjob was close to an upper level manager and was being protected as much as possible as well, and it was blatantly obvious. Even after everything was settled and nutjob was fired from the program this upper level manager had 1-on-1s with my team and still tried to frame the whole incident as our fault, and I let them know full on they weren't pulling that shit with me.\n\nAnyway, a month later I missed a 1-on-1 with my actual manager because I was attending a class. Got a nastygram e-mail from my manager with upper manager CCd saying that I hadn't communicated I was attending this class, that I was supposed to do this training on my own time, yadda yadda. Gave a very lengthy response saying that this e-mail was bullshit, along with copies of every electronic notification saying that not only was I signed up for this weeks ago, but it required manager approval, THEIR approval, and it was received, AND the manager was CC'd on the receipts. Even better, we had literally just spoken about me taking the class the prior week before because I was coming back from Covid leave and had discussed I was only going to be back in office for a week before going back out for the class.\n\nThis is why I tell everyone I work with, mentee, peer, or otherwise, get every communication from anyone with any authority over you in writing especially if you are getting approval to do something outside your normal routine, or being told to do something you disagree with. Even if you aren't being given an instruction, follow up any meeting with the least bit of officiality with a meeting summary e-mail of what was discussed.\n\nThat last part was especially important because part of nutjobs claim against me was that I was being regularly counseled for poor behavior and insubordination in my monthly 1-on-1s with my manager, which was patently false as I was actually being praised in the 1-on-1s they specifically mentioned and had record of it.",

For example, Google usually does a Step Up plan for a 6 month cycle that you CAN get off of with enough work, and then a 6 month PIP (provided you weren’t soooo bad that you went straight PIP). You really can’t transfer or do much to leave your situation when on either, so if you hate your role and are unmotivated, you have 1 year from SUP to plan your landing and continue performing the same at work.  At another company I worked for, PIPs were 30-45 days and you were out the door.  Knowing your policy informs how early you need to be brushing up the resume.  All that said, if you have the bandwidth, aim to do 1-2 rounds of external or internal interviewing per performance cycle anyways. It forces you to keep everything updated in reasonably small chunks, gives you a sense of the market, gives you practice interviewing, and who knows, you might find something you love or can use as leverage to bump pay. At bare minimum take opportunities to interview candidates FOR your company so you have some connection to the process always.  An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of layoff scrambling. \n\nSource: Sr level in tech who’s gotten the shove twice in 3 years.

Productivity remains the same because 8 people work a bit harder. Company then stops trying to hire 2 people and says they’re trying to hire but “can’t find anyone to fill the position.”\n\nPersons 6, 7, and 8 get burnt out and quit. Department now has 5 people. Company goes through backlog of applications, hires 2 people, you’re now at 7 employees. The 2 new hires get told the department size is normally 8, and they’re working on that last one. Productivity drops slightly, but Company is still making profit. Person 8 never gets hired, Persons 1-7 break their back doing the work of a 10 person team, and if anyone quits or gets fired, new hires will be told it’s a 7 person team, and get to work.\n\nThis is how every job is operating in 2024, causing incredibly high rates of turnover and burn out, while they have record high profits, while claiming “Nobody wants to work anymore.”",

Go spend the evening with your kids. “No I can’t, [manager] needs it” blah blah.\n\nThis guy must have done a whole year in unpaid overtime for this company if you totalled up those evenings and weekends. And wouldn’t you know it, he got told he was surplus to requirements just before Christmas. Three months to clear his shit up and get out, with a minimal payoff. The manager he reports to (on $160k minimum, so I’ve heard), got him a cheap bottle of wine by way of thank you. Amazing stuff. He told me yesterday he’s been getting grief from his manager now because “you haven’t trained anyone to cover your workload and you leave in a month.”\n\nThese people do not give even the slightest fuck about you.

It's not just a moment here or there things turn bad, it's far more often now than before.\n\nSeen the news article about a person working 27years, didn't miss a day of work (reasonably, I question this), and all they got was a backpack and movie tickets. They finally bought a house after a bunch of internet users donated to a GoFundMe for the person. (400K I think??)\n\nI work in an IT repair shop (for personal reasons, I will not go for 100% remote, I love the idea, and I support others for it, it's not for me), since the pandemic, more than half our team has left, Walmart upped their minimum pay beyond our starting pay (mind you, very rural, 1+hour drive to the nearest \"city\"), and clients have upped the anti for more and more while complaining we've upped our rates. Hell, there was TWO other IT shops in town, one was ran by a local bank, the other closed up shop last month, both closed up due to finances, the bank had other complications on top.\n\nThere's clearly IT people around, but their (other IT who lost their jobs) pay and our pay was close enough to say it was the same, and they, like myself, are burned out. There's clearly a demand for IT around here, but no one wants to pay IT rates, either because we resolved the issues easily, or they too are penny pinching. Hell, I've got a funeral home still using Windows 7 computers, because they can't afford to replace their systems, and hardly a month goes by we get a call about a computer/network/printer issue. There's a feed store running XP through Windows 7 just to keep their POS (Point Of Service) running, because the OWNER doesn't want to ditch the working software (I argue, but what ever), and the staff are just waiting for the owner to retire. Both locations have reasons, but at some point, where do you draw the line in costs, and sanity?\n\nGoing back on topic, I've got applications out, very few interviews, two took me seriously from the get go but declined. Walmart, I've had an application in since APRIL 2023, other than I forgot to do the monthly renew of the app in Dec, I haven't seen or heard squat. Is it because I'm over qualified? Did my reputation back in college not prove I'm a hard worker? Or is it because I didn't take management's BS about things that shouldn't even be issues with piss poor excuses? (Walkies sounded like shit, but it was due to a huge copper line ran under the building?? What line of BS is that?)",

Developing a high-profile website requires a lot of money, and the easiest way to get it is to promise returns on investment to people who have money to invest. Get in early on a big platform and you’ll make a fuckload of money, so it’s worth wasting some on those that fail. The problem is that then the website is run as a business and often can’t optimize for anything but “make more money”, even when that optimization hurts the users and, in the long run as the enshittification mounts, the platform itself. Eventually a new platform restarts the cycle, converting users by offering a better experience (that will be eventually enshittified in turn).\n\nIf you want a site that won’t be enshittified in the name of ever-increasing profit, then you need to align the institution behind the platform with the interests of their users, and it probably needs to be set up as a nonprofit and/or have other structural firewalls against being converted into a money-making business. The Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) is a good example: early Wikipedia users managed to say “haha fuck commercialization of volunteer work” and had (have) the option of taking their freely-licensed content with them to back it up; some people from the Spanish-language Wikipedia actually carried out the threat in 2002, before the 2003 establishment of the WMF.\n\nI wrote a similar comment recently and the main reply pointed out that choosing not to sell out in the face of earning millions or billions of dollars is tough. That’s why it’s important to structure the institution against potential corruption: you can’t let anyone be a Spez, including yourself.",

        "comment": "I taught kids in the pre-cell phone era and watched the tech invade the classroom in real time. It has completely changed the game.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nCell phones allow students to instantly text parents to give a very biased side of the story when they get in trouble. There was zero chance I'd be able to talk to the parents first when there was an issue with a kid.\nSocial media turned bullying and harassment into a 24/7 problem. When I was a kid, I had to deal with my bully in the few minutes before school, briefly at recess, then a few minutes after school. Unless your bully lived in your neighborhood, school stuff stayed at school.\n\nThe harassment and drama stirred up by social media was brought to school every day. Stuff that was said online was settled at school and physical fighting increased exponentially.\nIt became WAY harder to keep kids' attention. The allure of many apps that kids are into cater to a short attention span. The instant something gets boring, ditch it and pull up something else. That makes it really tough to pay attention to lessons in class.\nEarly on, it was nearly impossible to establish that a student was cheating or instigating via cellphone. It became completely impossible once lock screens became standard. The student could just refuse to unlock the phone.\n\nKids' mental health made a sharp decline as self-conscious kids are now comparing themselves to not only the highlight reel of the alpha student in their school, but the alpha students of all the schools in the general area. It began with MySpace, got worse with Facebook and completely bottomed out with Instagram.\n\nSO. MUCH. PORN. I taught middle school. Those boys could absolutely NOT help themselves. Watching porn in class, watching porn in the cafeteria, watching porn with their friends in the locker room. If they weren't watching it, they were talking over me in class to discuss it with their buddies.\nOnce cameras became a standard option on the cell phone? Now they're sending dirty pictures to each other and spreading them across the whole district. Now parents (who were uninterested in helping us to regulate cellphones up until now) were demanding the school get involved and do FBI-level investigations as to which particular students have a photo of their daughter's netherparts on their phones.",

But to use that possibility as the tradeoff for what we're seeing in classrooms is ...intentionally naive.\n\nIf we want to be real about it... most folks go straight to the \"school shooter\" scenario - as a defense for wanting their kids to always have a phone. But I'm not away of a single instance where some kid with a phone was the reason a life was saved. I could be wrong - and I'm open to evidence to the contrary. Communication? Yes - but requiring a student cellphone?\n\nThe school (should) have contact/communication methods already in place. They aren't relying on a student making a phone call with their cell phone. I'd be willing to bet most phones during such an event on just set to kids recording video and not \"calling for help\". And if so, if there's such an incident, a half dozen extra 911 calls aren't going to resolve anything quicker.\n\nThere's this fantasy survival scenario that gets is allowed to live in people's minds.\n\nI think there's a balance - like other safety, measures.",

I simply never got the hang of paper agendas, planners, and paper notes. My life got infinitely better when some teachers relaxed their device policy and I was actually able to remember what homework got assigned, because instead of fumbling to get my agenda out of my bag, I could simply type it into my phone and tell it to remind me to do it when I got home. In classes with strict teachers, I could never remember what was assigned, and, being a bit of a loner, I didn't have anybody I could rely on to help me with that.\n\nKids are not entirely stupid. I can assure you that there are plenty of ADHD-addled grade schoolers with a similar mindset, and being a luddite is only going to alienate them. We need to respect their intelligence and teach them how to use technology as a tool, because they're going to have it in their lives whether we like it or not. They're going to grow up with ChatGPT and who knows what comes next. Whatever happened to teaching people how to recognize reputable sources? How to set boundaries for themselves from technology? When it should and shouldn't be used? A blanket ban in the classroom will leave them to figure it out for themselves; wouldn't you rather be the one to teach them than TikTok, lest they learn the hard way later on?",

I don't know why this doesn't exist in the USA... but it's possible that it's easier to accomplish this in more homogenized societies. Ex-USSR countries generally have the same-type of instructors, people with hard personalities that feel very authoritative.

I teach my children evolution and accurate history, including the vast majority of black and native history that even good public schools don't spend time on. But teachers today are too afraid of lawsuits to handle problems in the schools that turn the schools into bad places for learning.\n\nIt's not that the teachers aren't knowledgeable enough to teach children. It's that if the kids want to look at their phones instead, they know there's a good chance they and the school will be sued if they don't let the kid just look at it. So that's what they do. My sons are in the local public high school, and the environment they describe and that I have observed when dropping by mid day (like to pick one of them up early) is not a good place for learning. It looks like a damn prison yard. And parents in other states describe the same thing.\n\nTheir elementary schools were good. Their middle schools weren't even too bad but that is where it started. Especially after covid though, the discipline both academically and behavior wise have become so lax that these places are just dangerous day cares.",

Only a parent can pick it up end of day (or whatever day they can). No ifs, no buts. Problem solved.

And as for my anecdotal experience visiting family in Finland and getting to see their schools, it was painfully obvious just how dumb American I was compared to Finns education wise. And while this next fact isn't solely a Finnish school thing, having kids learn multiple languages from 1st grade onward is way better than trying to learn some basic bitch level of speaking at high school.\n\nOf course things can decline and stagnate, and perhaps more recently that is true for Finnish schools based on your anecdote, but their public education is still leagues ahead of American ones which have stagnated for decades if not becoming corrupt and bloated what with the administrative salaries while teachers have to buy their own class room supplies.\n\nI'd also take a more carefree school than one getting shot up.",

Yes you can make friends online, but nothing replaces in-person interactions.\n\nAs much as this is a decent idea, we also need to find creative ways to make third spaces attractive for people to join.

Most kids places like play places and arcades cost in upwards of $40 per child not including extras and food or drink for a day of play and that's way out of reach of a lot of parents\n\nCovid closed up everything in my area for kids and it has not rebounded.

They are human beings who have free will. As a parent, I do my best to raise my kids to know how to comport themselves in different situations. My kids are HS freshman and since day 1 of them being in the school system, all their teachers & coaches have had only good things to say about them. But I am not naive enough to think they ALWAYS behave the right way. They are human beings; they are teenagers and they will explore, they will venture outside of the bounds I've set for them. That is life. I did the same when I was a teenager. When I see people write what you did, I suspect you think children are robots and parents can raise them to ALWAYS be compliant. I'm raising my children to have my values and to think for themselves. That combination is what I believe will serve them...even if they do something I wouldn't do.\n\n​\n\nWould you as a parent agree that, if a child is not in a situation (as described by you) where the phone is needed it should remain secure and out of sight?\n\nI expect my kids to not use their phones in the classroom.

I have witnessed it first hand when in the company of friends in a minority group but never to the extent of dealing with it in daily life. I respect the challenge this is for you and yours.\n\nI am not saying that kids need to be robotic, but I am saying they need to be accountable. As I mentioned I was in the schools (middle school to be precise). We had a no cell phone policy in that we couldn’t see it out. If they were out they were requested to be handed over and turned into office. After 2 instances parents would have to come retrieve them. In 75% of the cases the parents were pissed at the school admin for the confiscation and request for parental intervention. This policy was widely communicated and explained through multiple communications. It’s this experience that was the basis of my question. The overwhelming majority (>75%) did not hold their children accountable for not following policy. It would appear you would be in the minority of this group, which I assure you the teachers in your area greatly appreciate.\n\nFor my personal experience that is the argument I make, accountability. Parents, teachers and school used to be partners in this process. It no longer seems as though the groups are aligned in the mission. Cell phones are largely viewed as a right by parents, which honestly I think it’s a fair debate, but it shouldn’t be a contributor to the ever growing wedge between parents and schools.\n\nAgain thank you for honest commentary.",

But I would be ok with my kids having their phone on their person but not with using them in class. If something's going down at my kids' school, I want to be able to contact that. That need is above every other. Until such a time when school shootings are no longer a thing in this country.",

If a child was abducted or hurt on the way to or from school and wasn't carrying a phone because they weren't allowed to that would be another lawsuit.\n\nSomeone said one school on here gave their kids dumbphones and I think this might be something that would work.

But I’m not even a parent, just an involved aunt and I’d want my (age appropriate) kids to all have phones with the state of our country & school shootings etc. It may be controversial but I’d be the mom busting into that school to get the kids should something happen if I got a text or call because clearly the cops won’t as seen several times.",

        "comment": "Smart phones in schools are not all bad. A friend has a diabetic child. IEP and related paperwork all in place. He is specifically allowed to carry his glucometer which happens to be his cellphone. The new CGMs work via an app. A sub tried to seize the phone when he was checking his sugars between after that classes had been dismissed. He declined to turn it over and explained the IEP. Phone was taken anyway and he was sent to the office, where he explained the situation and they declined to do anything.\n\nNext day the father was at the office demanding the phone and the firing of the sub. Principal got involved and invoked school policy. The IEP and accommodation paperwork overrides school policy. It is literally a contract between the school and the family. 48 hours later the school district and the sub were served with an ADA lawsuit. He also filed a police complaint against the sub for theft of medical equipment and cited the principal as a conspirator after the fact. For those not familiar with ADA lawsuits, if you are filed upon, you lose in the vast majority of cases. All hell broke loose.\n\nSchool district superintendent called the father to find out the background, He was read a prepared statement that was pretty damning. The filing was public, but it had not been advertised. Father gave the superintendent 48 hours before it was posted to social media and sent to the local papers. There was some dancing around but the phone was returned, the principal apologized to the father and student, and the sub was gone. With the phone returned, the police stood down as well. Principal tried to force a rewrite of the IEP but after a phone call to the superintendent, that was quashed.\n\nThe portable computer nature of smartphones mean they are usable for more than just Tik Toks, and the schools need to accommodate that.",

It’s about regulating tech, and more importantly, the control of information.\n\nThe knee jerk reaction here is to support banning phones in schools. The way teachers are treated needs to be addressed, of course.\n\nThe link I’m posting (I couldn’t find a transcript for it, albeit I didn’t look very hard for one..)   Gives a great overview on the issue, and it’s problems.   Places like where I live, the state is run by a theocracy that would love nothing more than to control all of the information incoming to the young population.  \n\n\nAt home the parents can have control over this, while at school, these kids have some freedom of expression, an escape from the trappings of the society around them. It’s really worth a listen.\n\nThe journalist is Diane Rehm. She’s pretty great. banning phones and the push for tighter tech regulation.",

My only point is that while some academically inclined people will be able to control themselves, the vast majority do not.\n\nI’m in my late 20s now and I grew up with basically everyone having a smartphone while in high school. Teachers don’t have omnivision. 90% of phone users in class were able to get away with it. And this was a time when the internet wasn’t as morally corrupt and social media wasn’t gamified to the extent it is today. It’s like giving each student a quick dopamine release button in their pocket and not expecting them to use it in the class. Again, ideally we don’t need to resort to draconian laws in schools as well. But the majority of kids nowadays don’t think too far ahead…",

Kids don’t have trouble looking after/caring for devices, even at the elementary level. My spouse handles all of the devices for her school & less than 0.2% of them were damaged and needed replacing last year (I was shocked).\n\nThe issue kids do have is stuff like how computers work - saving files, etc. It’s surprising how many 5th graders (and even middle schoolers) I’ve worked with that don’t even know what folders are.\n\nEdit to add - this is a poor district. The pay is the lowest in the area. For reference my spouse makes $25k/yr (full time) in an area where our house is worth $600k. The neighboring district would pay her about double, but the commute is a pain & jobs are hard to come by.",

That, the lawsuit says, enables OpenAI to “compete with and closely mimic” the New York Times, perhaps by summing up a news story based on Times reporting or summing up a product recommendation based on Wirecutter reviews.\n\nEven worse is what the lawsuit calls “regurgitation,” which is when OpenAI spits out text that matches Times articles verbatim. The Times provides 100 examples of such “regurgitation” in the lawsuit. In its rebuttal, OpenAI said that regurgitation is a “rare bug” that the company is “working to drive to zero.” It also claims that the Times “intentionally manipulated prompts” to get this to happen and “cherry-picked their examples from many attempts.”\n\nThe verbatim reproduction is obviously breaking copyright, that needs to be prevented and no one disagrees with that\n\nThe top issue though, whether consuming copyrighted material into the knowledge graph counts as breaking copyright, is not at all clear cut\n\nDoes Google indexing that content so it comes up in search results then count to? What if a human reads an article and then enters knowledge they gain into a machine graph?",

I think every clickbait article wants it to be about fair use and AI in general but i havnt seen that discussed in their lawsuit.\n\nI think what OpenAI will need to do is prove it’s impossible to elicit verbatim reproduction once they fix the “bug”.\n\nThat’s a tall task because it would probably severely affect performance and can probably still be jailbroken.\n\nI think the bigger question is whether it’s even possible to prevent an AI from verbatim reproduction of data it trained on. There’s all sorts of ways to trick the AI into just copying whole articles word for word. I can easily foresee OpenAI saying “we fixed the bug, it won’t reproduce articles now” and then NYT can do some clever prompting and show “nope you are still distributing our work, we prompted xyz and the AI responded with our entire article”",

Well no. Then you add the complexity of this being done on a massive level by a corporation for profit and things start to get a lot more complicated.

So eg. republishing Shakespeare would be plagiarism but not copyright infringement. Claiming that it was your entirely original work when selling it might also be fraud or a breach of contract depending on the situation but you can't just go sue someone for plagiarism,",

I don't see any mention of it, but I'd expect this contest would have some form of attestation where the submitter confirms the novel is their work.\n\nLooks like this isn't the first time this prize has had issues around plagiarism. Should initially uncredited use of a machine's \"ideas\" be considered an ethical problem and weighted as heavily? Or should we view it as a tool under the control of author; and their choices on how to integrate AI output into the work is another form of human expression?\n\nEdit: Or say machines are not human and it utter nonsense to apply any form of human-ish rights/protections to the resulting output.

I know it won't happen, and that your profs will probably run your essay through some \"AI Detection Tool\" that they don't understand (and probably doesn't work) and fail you bc the AI told them to (IRONIC!), but what should happen is that your profs are skeptical then they should find another way of assessing what you've learned.\n\nif the goal is for you to learn facts or concepts or whatever, they can ask you to demonstrate understanding in another way, like a real-time conversation.\n\nif the goal is to assess your writing skills, they should specify what tools you are/n't allowed to use (eg, Pencil? Cool! Word Processor? I guess, but what about spellcheck and opening web links? Hmmm...etc)\n\nIf the goal is assess your preparedness for life outside of academia, full stop?

When you're designing a permissions API you have to think about what any and all apps might do (or indeed what that one limited app might want to do in the future) as well as account for potential changes under the hood of the OS itself down the road.\n\nIt's not as easy as \"only let apps write to their own folder\", because some apps might need to edit files that aren't in its own folder - social media apps that do on-the-fly editing, photo viewers/editors, etc.",

Mainly on my laptop as I liked my desktop for gaming without a million scripts to get things running. With Linux being Open Source I can say with much confidence that there is no operating system level tracking on my laptop, the same cannot be said for Windows or Mac. With Windows 11 Microsoft's advertising and built in tracking has passed a threshold for me, I'm now very likely to jump to Linux on my desktop rather than upgrade from 10 to 11. And tools like Proton can run some Windows games better on Linux than on Windows.\n\nI think we might be at a point in time where FOSS could appeal to more average users. Not all, some people don't seem to care, but maybe a good few more do.\n\nFree Open Source Software doesn't refer to the price, it refers to the direction, the liberty. If the community doesn't like the direction a FOSS Project is going, they have the capability to change it themselves. The Open Source element means users can see and know for themselves what the software they're running is doing.\n\nUbuntu, Linux Mint and PopOS! have lowered the barrier to entry for Linux. Check out protondb, Linux gaming is now viable for many people!\n\nAndroid Open Source Project exists, and if you want a phone that doesn't track you, that's achievable.\n\nAll these things don't financially cost anything.\n\nThe slightly depressing reality is we enjoy the convenience. I'm typing this from a Google Pixel with the stock ROM because I like the camera and wallet and am not sure custom ROMs can maintain the quality and realibility of those things. I use WhatsApp because it's free, very usable, reliable and widely used.\n\nBut we haven't lost control, we just choose not to take it.",

From smartphone and operating system builders who often allow apps to start all those connectivity and sensing means to be started up from the apps without the user even noticing.\n\nFrom various companies literally forcing you to use and install apps and enabling said connectivity means sometimes (oh sure, let's activate camera and localization to scan an unknown QR code just to be able to order a burger. And if you could also enter your credit card informations in the same app so you can pay for it, that would be great). To just catastrophes awaiting to happen (here I'm looking at all those healthcare connected objects that companies are starting to push and not only monitor you, but are also programmed to deliver drugs and perform corrective actions. All are using smartphones to gather and analyse data and then take decisions. What will happen if someone is able to enter the system and send wrong prompts on them? Not even speaking of the day health insurances will start buying said data to calculate your new health insurance premium and if ever they'll cover yo. Or if you're deemed too risky/expensive.

Even taking all of the preventative measure you’re talking about, there are cookies on your phone that you can’t turn off. Despite opting out of everything apps ask you to do (location services, access to your contacts, etc) there are apps that come programmed onto phones with that stuff automatically turned on, and as the user below pointed out, a lot of people are ignorant. They are not only ignorant on how to turn that off—when it’s even possible—they are also ignorant to the implications of leaving it on/what tech companies can do with their data. In addition to all of that, even if you don’t keep your banking information on your phone, you have no control over the companies that do store that information in their systems/how they protect it.\n\n& it’s not like not having a phone is an option, in todays world that isn’t realistic. employers aren’t going to be inconvenienced by your decision to be unplugged, they’ll hire someone else. If you do chose that, you’re information will still be out there because again, you have no control over how companies that have your information store it/protect it.\n\nTech companies should absolutely be blamed and regulation of some sort is possible. The genie can’t be put back in the bottle, but we can do a hell of a lot more than we are currently doing to protect individuals and their data/how that data is used.",

You know how that same phone will show \"emergency calls only\" when you turn it on? It's still got a receiver and transmitter, and will connect to local cell towers, so you can make 911 calls even if your sim card isn't inserted, damaged, or you aren't paying for service.\n\nWireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) are broadcast on all wireless provider frequencies for the area they're relevant to, and will be picked up by any WEA-capable device when it connects to a network. It's been in place for over a decade, first used in 2012 IIRC.\n\nIt has absolutely nothing to do with tech companies spying on you, other than showcasing that people don't understand how their devices actually work which makes it easier to take advantage of them.",

The angular resolution required to identify facial features from the lowest altitudes that spy satellites operate from would require 20+ meter apertures.

That's the base requirement for someone looking directly up at a satellite, and that's before accounting for the imaging sensor, for the relative movement of the satellite, for atmospheric distortion, or any of the other effects that make what you're suggesting impossible.\n\nIt's not even a matter of secret technology, of \"pixel resolution,\" or of magical devices that can somehow overcome all of the problems involved in optical sensing from orbit.

The altitude assumption is 250 kilometers, which is right around the minimum periapsis for large optical imaging satellite orbits. The 2-3 meter aperture optical imaging spy satellites that orbit at those altitudes have diffraction-limited resolutions - that is, resolutions limited by the laws of physics - of around 7 centimeters at sea level.\n\nEven if you changed the mass of the planet to have zero relative movement between satellite and subject, even if the subject looked up directly into the satellite, even if the planet had no atmosphere at all to avoid distortion, even if the mirror was completely flawless, and even if you had a perfect imaging sensor behind the optics, a person's face could not physically show up as more than 3-4 individual pixels in a digital image.",

A huge chunk of the ads you see on the internet are buying 3rd party data that is anonymized. So I might be Dell and want to buy data on purchasers of technology — it’s easy to use a platform on the open market and check through Amex offerings to find audiences that have that trait as they have purchase data for their credit card users.\n\nTarget, however, has customer profiles with all of your online purchases with your name and address, and even in-store purchases if you input an email or phone for rewards. If I’m a retailer of bedsheets and I want to buy into Targets walled garden, I have access to very specific targeting options.

The best we have is an algorithm that can reasonably pick what the next word is going to be and say words in a relatively human voice. It takes purposeful constant meticulous research and work to create an ai that will act maliciously.\n\nOn top of that the people who design ai like this make it so humans have the overriding control because they know the algorithms being used may find an edge case and act inappropriately, in which case having human intervention is required to stop or change the settings.\n\nTo put into perspective, creating an actual ai is harder than all the research and effort and manpower that went into all of space flight.\n\nThe ai of today has no idea of what is and is not important. It simply looks at human behaviour and has determined that an action is the most likely next step. It has no idea why that step is important or what it actually does in the grand scheme. It just sees a number and a reaction associated with the number, and a calculation to achieve the number.\n\nIt is not ai that people need to be worried about. It's the people who say \"LOOK AT THE DANGEROUS AI AND NOT OVER HERE WHERE HUMANS ARE ALREADY DOING WORSE\". The kinds of people who say ai is bad are the kinds of people who would design the ai to do bad things.\n\nAn ai is a tool just as much as a car is.

Nuclear reactors are controlled by ai but there is still a big red button to shut down the reactor any human can press.\n\nSo yes everyone does take the time to build failsafe into the creations because its the easiest way to test. Especially with something as large and complex as ai. Ask any computer coder how they test and they will say they put in stop points to check to see if the variable is correct. Or even code that generates pop up as specific moments. On top of that if there are no failsafe there is no way to control the program.

So explain how using a test environment, shutting the down ai when it acted wrongly, and examining the code to figure out why it acted wrongly are not examples of fail safes?\n\nAnd again bringing it back to the car, an ai is a tool just as a car is. It has breaks, signals, on off position, park, drive, reverse. Yet a human can still use it to cause a lot of destruction. But a car on its own cannot. It requires a human to cause it to act maliciously and bypass all those failsafes.\n\nAnd a quote from your article.\n\nStill, those behind the most recent Apollo Research study say it should be treated as an standalone early result. More research needs to be done, they said, before they can draw any broad conclusions about AI's so-called deceptive qualities.\n\n\"Our report should thus be treated as an isolated preliminary finding which will be embedded into a larger, more rigorous investigation in the future,\" the paper concludes.\n\nSo what the article is actually saying is the ai was given an instruction to lie about having recieved information, and it lied to the user about reviewing information. Seems like it worked as intended. The next part is understanding how it came up with the lie. The real question is if it understands the consequences of lying. The ai is a predictive word generator. Not a truth bot where it can only give you facts. The ai doesn't understand what a lie is. Only that it was told not to present this information when asked for an explanation",

Hell, I think even the SR5 Premium has it, when the more expensive Off Road Premium didn't. The fact that a $43K car doesn't have such a basic feature that even sub $30K cars have drives me absolutely nuts.\n\nI just spent $350 this week to get a 3rd party remote start kit that includes app start. On the flip side, my wifes hyundai which does have remote start that is app driven is about to lose it because her free trial on the app is expiring. There is no key option, they are forcing you to use the app. This is infuriating. I'd rather just buy her an aftermarket kit rather than us pay a monthly fee to use their stupid app.",

I had a complaint into my State Attorney General because when I purchased my 2020 Highlander Hybrid Platinum all wheel drive in January of 2021, all of the advertisements set it included remote start, and none of them had asterisks saying it was hidden behind their service connect. Later that year when I learned that my key fob remote start would quit functioning after my trial was up, and I could not sell the vehicle with the key fob remote start working as the 10-year trial of service connect is only for the original owner, I lodged a complaint with my state attorney general. About 2 weeks later, all of the advertising stuff at the dealership changed and now had the little asterisk indicating that the remote start was behind their remote connect and service connect services. My complaint is one of the reasons why my service connect trial on both of my vehicles got extended to 10 years, as well as Toyota being forced to extend a service connect trials on every vehicle from 2020 up until 2023 to 10 years. I cannot sell my vehicles as including a remote start, it is not included to the second owner, they will have to pay $8 per month. There are no remote start systems in the aftermarket world that work with 20/20 and newer Toyota hybrid vehicles.",

We've reached 40+ consecutive days above 100 degrees a couple times in our past snd let me tell you that is absolutely hell. Ever get in a car that has been sitting in the sun all day when it's 105+ and you have black leather interior? It fucking sucks.\n\nOn the flip side. Just this week we had 3 days when temps hit 10 degrees and wind chills were 0 or below and we see temps below that at times. Having the car already started and warmed up is incredible.\n\nTo add to all of this....having a baby or a toddler you have to wrestle into a car seat compounds the luxury of this feature. Ever try to rush a 2 yesr old into a car seat when it's 105 degrees and you're getting blasted by the sun and it's 130 degrees inside your car? It's not a good time I assure you.",

It is already programmed into the ECU to have the key fob remote start function, they have included it on every new vehicle since around 2018. They added the server check so that you are forced to pay a subscription. The server check is unnecessary, Toyota did confirm this.\n\nToyota also confirmed that they can remove the server check, because in 2021, all the cellular radios from 2019 and older vehicles went dead, because the 3G bands that they used were taken offline. Toyota updates those vehicles to not require a server check anymore, which means they can remove the server check from newer vehicles too.\n\nThere's another thing Toyota does, that is very baffling to me. The new vehicles in base model trims do not have the remote start or remote services.\n\nToyota claims it's because it doesn't have a data connection module, or dcm, the cellular radio in the infotainment system. The problem is that the DCM is part of the infotainment system and still exists.\n\nHow can you tell? Because Toyota can tell you the exact mileage of your brand new toyota, even the Le base model without the tech package. You will get emails as to when to schedule services, or what services are due. They will tell you the mileage at a dealership, all they need is the VIN to look it up. Toyota is still collecting your driving data, and that DCM is still connecting to them. They have just decided to wall off those features so they can charge more for what is already there.\n\nMy 2021 Toyota Sienna is an le, it's not supposed to have a dcm, and it's not supposed to have the remote connect features, and it's not supposed to be able to do any of those things, yet due to some kind of bug or glitch with the Toyota app after I bought it in 2021, I was able to register it with Toyota connected services, and activate a 10-year subscription trial on the toyota \"service connect\" service. My dealership was baffled and wanted me to do it on several other people's cars, but I could not replicate the bug or the glitch.",

Toyota has to pay monthly for you to be able to use that communication path, so therefore I don't have a problem with them charging you monthly for it. (unlike BMW's heated seats. BMW doesn't pay monthly for you to continue to have heated seats)\n\nbut if you don't want the \"service connect\" pay-subscription service, you can have them install just a regular 2-way radio style key-fob instead. It is also a dealer option offered. It doesn't use the \"service connect system\" and if so therefore if you're too far away from your car it doesn't work (just like any traditional remote start). but it also doesn't cost monthly to operate.\n\nthe \"service connect\" remote start system is a customer chosen option during sale of the vehicle.

For example, early GPT-4 had no knowledge of the war in Ukraine, or of the recent AI breakthroughs - which is quite ironic.

The goal over the last few years has been to move what are closer to lookups to on device then fail to the cloud. Then you optimize what you can get done on device.\n\nRight now on device you get a lot of Visual Inputs. Audio conversions, as you mentioned Sentiment Analysis ( who they look or are feeling ).\n\nYou also get a lot of Branch Prediction... Think of it like guessing what the most likely best outcome will be ... for things like Maps when you say \"take me to a Gas Station or Charging Station.\" Or if you ask your phone to make a playlist like XYZ radio channel or artist.\n\nMy space is more security related...

Thats an obvious transition from their anti-competition practices, and history of locking down their devices so people can't do things like root their phones and whatnot and constant pestering/forcing customers to have a samsung account if you want to use their phones.\n\nEDIT: downvote me all you want. but I don't trust that in 3yrs there wont be something akin to an \"update\" to their native photo or video editing app where all the sudden it requires \"AI assistance\" that only works online if you want to do basic features that are natively available now like cropping a video, or doing things like blurring parts of your photos.\n\nother companies have done exactly that kind of stuff, and as much as I like Samsungs's phones, they aren't exactly known for being consumer friendly.....",

You need humans to interact with AI to improve and refine it for the application you’re looking to achieve. AI cannot help you accomplish a novel task without someone with experience to guide AI towards the right solution. And even then, a solution driven by AI must be reviewed and validated. AI can basically output possibilities, and then people must act on those possibilities. It can accelerate work, but without commanded inputs, and selected outputs, it does not effectively replace humans in many industries.\n\nCurrent AI is best described as a recall tool for a simulated database. It simulates solutions that may or may not be what you’re looking for. And ironically it is prone to error just like humans, and very easily biased just like humans. It just makes these determinations so much faster. Speaking from experience, AI has the potential to dramatically complicate a business just as much as it could help streamline it. One day we may see a mass replacement due to AI, but I don’t see it happening in the next 18mo (as Bill Gates suggests).",

Is your smart oven 100% guaranteed safe from a random hacker running a scan and finding something to play with, turning all your burners up to 11 just because he could? Of course not. Nothing is 100% hack proof. Why bet your house or your life on whatever infosec program was the lowest bidder for an appliance company?\n\nI feel like this tenet applies here. I'm no farmer, but tractors seemed like they were doing fine without the internet.

Thanks for the heads-up,” said one [/khongkhoe].\n\n• The supermarket claims a technical error meant that the wrong price for the customer’s discounted mangoes was displayed on the screen.\n\n+\n\n/edgiepower: “That doesn't make sense. How can the display price be more than the maths price?”\n\n/Nidstang666: “So the database has one value for the displayed item price, but sums another value to determine total price?”\n\n/ImmaturePlace: “To me that suggests the tally is totalled from a central pricing database, yet the item that gets scanned and displayed the price comes from from another database table? So if two sources are different, which is correct?”",

The mangoes were supposed to be $1 off the regular price of $2.80.\n\nI can think of 2 ways this could happen:\n\nThe code that renders the price display is getting a base price that was already discounted in the cart and applying the discount (for a second time) when rendering out the text. Either the widget expects the base price to be undiscounted or it was only supposed to display an already-applied discount.\n\nAnother possibility is a simple bug in the display code that applies the discount twice. I think this is more likely since the total discount display also shows the doubled discount.\n\nThere are going to different discount types in that PoS system, so it wouldn't surprise me if the bug isn't common because it only affect a particular type of discount.",
