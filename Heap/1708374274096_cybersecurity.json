When it is a threat actor with HOK you will typically recognize it as not normal, and it should be escalated to IR. How often do you see a doctor or accountant or customer service running power shell download cradles with obfuscation, or enumerating all the domain admins/domain controllers in your environment?

Your DMARC policy tells email relays what to do with emails that do not conform. You also need to look a bit more into \"passing DMARC\" as a phishing email can pass all DMARC checks. You can't really stop an email from passing DMARC if the attackers are using a domain they control.\n\nIf your SPF record is correctly set (e.g., not overly broad, controlled sources(, an attacker spoofing your domain will be flagged.",

Anyway, the service owner wanted extra detective controls so they'd know which engineer went into which hall of the DC at what time.\n\nThey use the data to find \"gaps\" in some of their procedural controls around access (by trusted engineers who had a change request &c); maybe they found some more direct security benefits, perhaps around monitoring remote workers, but from my perspective they wanted the logs and they got the logs and I got paid. :-)\n\nAlso as an interim thing when a company split, they were untangling their IT as well as their physical sites simultaneously and wanted to be able to look for patterns of entry that didn't match our assumptions. Maybe it identified some cleaners or site-maintenance people &c.\n\n​\n\nThought the use case for SIEM was to monitor network infrastructure\n\nA SIEM can monitor all kinds of other stuff!

But, imagine if a SOC gets an alert that someone has opened a door at 2am on a Sunday that has never been opened at 2am on a Sunday. They can contact physical security and have them investigate.\n\nSimilarly, if your logs capture when someone badges in, it may catch a duplicated badge doing an \"impossible badge-in\" where they badge in the East Coast location and within an hour badge in at the West Coast location.\n\nJust because it isn't common, doesn't mean it shouldn't be happened.",

Our only \"restricted\" room is our data closet. I actually loop the physical review in with the quarterly RBAC review. I don't actually look for unauthorized access, I just confirm that those who do have access still have it for valid reasons.

It's fine to be interested in the subject, but I strongly recommend that you don't start playing around out on the internet with tools you don't understand just for the adrenaline. It's called cybersecurity not cyberfuckingaround, the goal is to make things more secure, not causing damage to others.\n\nI'll also add that cybersecurity is an offshoot of computer science, so I suggest you look into computer science and networking first before engaging in security : coding simple stuff, making a small web server on your local network, subnetting, etc.",

Sometimes they want you to test something very specific and it doesn't always include \"breaking into people's computers\".\n\nIn any case, focus on learning how to code, do some coding challenges in CodinGame or AdventOfCode, look into networking courses, and ultimately aim for a Computer Science degree. If you're already passionate about security and computer science, you'll have a big headstart on other students and you can get hired pretty quickly. Make a GitHub account and work on small projects, whether they are related to cybersecurity or not. A bunch of people I know are software developers, system admins or even blue team analysts in cybersecurity, but still do hacking challenges as a hobby on the side (HackTheBox, etc). There are tons of things in computer science that are super interesting, can make you a lot of money, and will all help with ethical hacking in some way or another.\n\nI think a lot of people get super excited about hacking thinking it's like Mr. Robot, and it gives a sense of power to play around on Kali Linux, but ultimately to exploit computer systems means you have to understand them well, or else you won't know what you're doing and you'll likely get hurt or break something.",

Learn unix and windows inside and out as much as you can, active directory, windows registry etc.\n\nStep 2. Learn computer networking, computer networking is the engine of the internet, without it there is nothing, if you know networking life is going to be a lot easier, go for about ccna level.\n\nstep 3. Learn python, do a course in python, after you’ve completed that course and throughout the duration of that course start creating projects, create a github account and upload your projects there, develop a platform for yourself. Do not be afraid to boast. Python will take time to learn if you aren’t willing to devote the time then you will fail.\n\nOnce you’ve completed these steps go straight to tryhackme and learn everything you can.

The engine should scan for vulns but would never initiate cobalt strike c2 for example.\n\nExtremely limit outbound Internet connectivity for the scanner.

Very thorough and engineering focused. I was looking at SEC401, but am worried a lot will be review of stuff I already know. But then looking at SEC504 or SEC503, I worry it may be too challenging. I currently am working as an Information Security Analyst, not using CLI on my day to day basis. How awful are the 500 level courses? While I got A’s in my program, I am by no means a scripting prodigy. Thank you for any input!

They're knowledgeable subject matter experts that are pulled from industry. The classroom environment (in person) is a great way to have some dedicated back-and-forth mentorship getting exchanged.\nBy contrast, the exam process itself for nearly all of their exams is the same. The open secret to passing them is the use of well-crafted indexes to X-ref the proprietary training materials and being efficient with your time. Comprehension of the material helps, but so long as you're comfortable with the exam pedagogy, I wouldn't doubt anyone could pass an arbitrary 5XX-level certification exam. By extension, I've never had any certification (besides my OSCP) be explicitly mentioned in the course of an interview, screening or otherwise.\nI second what /u/Cryptosmasher86 said: paying for the training/exam out-of-pocket is not worth it.",

I've been researching potential job paths in IT and had enrolled and completed a full stack web development bootcamp while attending my community college course.\n\nAfter being assigned to do research on Kali Linux for my Linux class, I've become a little interested in cybersecurity, and started following channels related to reverse engineering and malware analysis. I was wondering for a student in my position, what would a career path look like for me to get into a reverse engineering position? Would I be able to start the path right out of college while studying in my free time? I am currently learning an assembly language in my free time, and one of my courses is learning the C programming language so that might be an asset.\n\nI was also thinking would it be a good idea to look into app security? Like I said I graduated from a full-stack web development course, so I'm at a beginner level for full stack web app development, and I'm currently going through a Spring-Boot book while learning Java in College.\n\nFinally I was also potentially interested in combining my developing programming skills from college into maybe something like security engineering or devsecops? Although this one seems much harder to get into than the others..\n\nFor a person in my position (I'm also Canadian if this matters) what would you suggest for me?",

Altogether, I felt my experience at work was disconnected from my academic/certification efforts. I told my management all throughout how I was interested in changing the work I was being assigned, but it never came about in the years I was there; I knew I wasn't doing what I wanted to do, so I began looking around elsewhere for opportunities (including developer roles).\n\nUltimately, I pivoted to a penetration testing opportunity when it arose (and then later to a job in Application Security).",

I went from an unrelated military career direct into GRC, then from GRC to penetration testing, then from pentesting to AppSec.\n\nwhere do you source the malware samples you end up reverse engineering?\n\nIt's a mixed bag.\n\nSince looking at malware is tangential to my job's core responsibilities, I'm not consistently engaged in seeking them out (unlike my peers in our threat intel group). I'll look at what gets flagged/quarantined now and again, but most samples that get pulled from there are pretty similar to one-another in functionality (i.e. not novel enough to be worth the trouble).\n\nIn my case, the function of looking at malware in the wild is to try and extend/replicate such functionality in our own tools safely. This way we can deploy our own inspired payloads which will replicate the capabilities of the malware - all the while having complete control/comprehension of what our code is doing.\n\nHaving said that, there's still a lot of different ways I want to take this initiative; I haven't delved much (read: at all) into the mobile side of things, for example. My understanding of ARM-based architectures is much weaker than x86.",

Typically this would be as part of a two person team and as a 'junior' member you might be involved in taking notes during expert interviews. Prepare meeting minutes to send out to involved parties. Other aspects would include light touch project management aspects, e.g. scheduling meetings with identified stakeholders (for expert interviews), acquiring evidence, filing acquiring evidence and reviewing it. Developing draft audit findings.. as you acquire experience on the domain side, you may get involved in actively participating in interviews, i.e. actually asking questions.. Re 2; auditors can transition to GRC side, i.e. selling value to industry as the experienced audit lens. Which in turn may lead to you being on the other side of the auditor, taking questions.. one avenue.. 3. Cisa for audit process but then any and all others related to developing technical expertise..",

If your professor is repeatedly knocking down your proposals and clearly/succinctly spelling out suggestions for what they would accept, then perhaps it's time to bite the bullet and just do a project that's topically uninteresting to you.\nHealthcare and blockchain tech are topics that have been batted-around for quite a while (e.g. a kind of patient-records utility). This innately incorporates cryptography, so you kind of get worked in that way. This could also look into an alternative way for for approaching \"zero trust\", just not in the way we typically talk about it.\nI'd consider looking at past student works (usually professors keep a repository of prior-submitted material) to get a better understanding of what has been accepted in the past.

For you I would presume that GDPR would be a common requirement.\n\nIf GRC is what your looking for I would encourage trying to find local GRC professionals in your region via LinkedIn and having a conversation on what they do and their recommendations for you. If your able to speak to a Senior or managerial level ask them questions like \"What would be the ideal candidate (junior or mid) that you would want to work with.

You’re going to have to spend time getting to know what is normal behavior for the estate you are protecting. No one comes off the street without any training needed. You can teach people tools. People can learn the baselines. But you can’t teach a culture fit.\n\nI don’t care if your knowledge eclipses the sun. If I can’t sit in an office with you for 40 hours a week without want to rip my ears off, I’ll probably pass on you. If your skills are yet to be seen but I know I can work with you for the next decade? We’ll get you the skills.",

My own experience has been that people only partially, minimally, or barely qualified for a given role are hired because of who they know (I've never seen someone with absolutely zero professional skills make it into cyber). I know I've never been hired based on my connections alone (and I have tried). That being said, I would agree that knowing the right people gets you places or, as was the case with me, can help you stay where you are, even if only ensuring you're among the last to go in difficult times (like these where the tech sector has seen massive layoffs).\n\nI'll elaborate. Looking at my experience (if you're in the industry and the know) you wouldn't question my qualifications or expertise. I was lucky enough to be kept on while my employer at the time was struggling financially (not debt, just not being as profitable as the slave driver shareholders would have liked) and im fairly certain it was due not only to the recognition of my skills and value but also being personable or at the very least memorable for the right reasons to the right people.\n\nBy the same token, I've also seen completely incompetent people remain not only employed but in positions of power or worst yet promoted, this is what you would refer to as failing upwards. Unfortunately, there is no denying that the mediocre still have a place on the corporate ladder and it's most unfortunate and down right maddening that it's not exclusively the bottom rung or the unemployment line. There is also no denying that the biggest reason for their continued success has been their soft skills, being great to work with or just good at brown nosing, blaming others, begging for second chances, or being pathetic enough to warrant people's pity can get you places.\n\nI've often wished for and have contemplated possible solutions to this problem but ultimately I believe there is no beating the fact that it's possible to remediate a lack of skill or knowledge but you can't do much about changing someone who has a shitty attitude and is unpleasant to work with.",
