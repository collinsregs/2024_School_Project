Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[6][7] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.",

        "comment": "Self-checkout really improved the situation at my local safeway. It's a smaller older one, but really near my home and its super convenient, but before they installed a cluster of self-checkout there was always a huge line for 1-2 cashiers. 99% of the ppl in this store use it to get like 3-4 items for dinner or something, and it's just way faster. Four self-checkouts improved the experience 1000x imo... But yeah, echoing others, it kinda sucks for big trips.",
