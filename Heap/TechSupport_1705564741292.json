Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[6][7] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.",

        "comment": "I followed and according to this, the crash happened with \"GenuineIntel.sys\". So something with Processor or chipset (or maybe RAM).\n\nNo, but it's an easy mistake to make. WHEA crashes are confirmed by the CPU's error record, a hardware error log in the CPU. The CPU logs errors for itself and PCIe devices. When reading these errors Windows uses the Intel driver so it will always list that in a WHEA crash (Or AMD driver with an AMD CPU).\n\nYou will find lots of people saying RAM with WHEA crashes, but WHEA doesn't monitor RAM. If you use XMP speeds higher than what is officially supported by the CPU you are overclocking the memory controller (Part of the CPU) which can cause WHEA crashes. On your CPU this is 3200MT/s DDR4 and 5600MT/s DDR5. It's not really common to get WHEA crashes from this, usually you get crashes that look like faulty RAM, but it can happen.\n\nAfter I tried to read the minidump-files (first with bluescreenview), the problem occured everytime with:\n\nntoskrnl.exe+4fed2b and PSHED.dll+10c0\n\nBluescreenview (And Whocrashed) is not a good tool for a lot of reasons and just doesn't work for debugging WHEA crashes. As you have a dump file, please share it following the method posted by the bot. A good debugger is WinDBG Preview which you can get for free from the Windows Store.\n\nFrom your other issues I would have faulty storage as the main suspect, but crashing can corrupt files so that might be why you had those other issues.\n\nA bad PSU can cause WHEA crashes, but it's not common.",

To me it feels like the Microsoft forums just use it to have something to blame when they can't find anything. Driver Verifier is a developer tool for people making their own driver. If they have any mistakes in code Driver Verifier will quickly cause a BSOD even if it's not a critical error. Most third party drivers have mistakes in code so you just get a ton of bluescreens when running Driver Verifier against all drivers even on perfectly stable machines.\n\nMost likely the HDD died. If it's not detected at all there isn't much you can do.",

Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[6][7] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.",

If you think it would take too long to even know if your computer will shut down (like days) then yeah I would recommend just using your pc however you’d like at home with a UPS and seeing if any issues arise, but they are pretty expensive.",

Do not interact with the suspicious tab.\n\nThat string it typed (49b67943-882c-4dfe-b487-084c7d750b07) is likely related to a specific remote code execution (RCE) bug in Chrome. Google that string to find out more details.\n\nRun a full system scan with updated, reputable antivirus software like Windows Defender or Malwarebytes. Quarantine/remove any threats found.\n\nCheck for and install any available updates for Chrome, your OS, and other programs. Many vulnerabilities are patched this way.\n\nBe cautious of any unusual browser/system behavior in the future. Consider changing passwords for important accounts accessed on that PC.\n\nAs a precaution, you may want to back up personal files and do a factory reset to wipe the system and reinstall from scratch.\n\nThe good news is the bug was likely exploited remotely without user interaction.

Could I use one of the 15 dollar PSU testers from amazon to very its the PSU and not the MOBO?\n\nSpecs:\n\nCPU: Ryzen 7 2700x\n\nGPU AMD 7900 XT\n\nPSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 1300 G2 120-G2-1300-XR 80+ GOLD 1300W Fully Modular Includes FREE Power On Self Tester Power Supply (Bought in 2014)\n\nMobo: ASUS Prime X470-Pro AM4 AMD X470 SATA 6Gb/s ATX AMD Motherboard",

Both wireless.\n\nThis type of device is an easy way to extend range, but it is bad for performance. \n\nWireless radio waves, if transmitted at the same time will corrupt the signals, similar to how it's difficult to hear when many people are talking at the same time. \n\nAs the extender need to relay the signal (first it receives the signal, then it will forward it) it uses twice the air time, so speed is reduced by half. \n\nAs you have ethernet, a better solution is to use wireless access points. Their function is similar to extenders in that they connect to client devices, but they use ethernet to connect back to the router. \n\nWhen connecting ethernet you need to connect all cables back to the router, which may limit the placement of the router. You likely have all ethernet ports in your house converge to the same place, like a patch panel. \n\nSo you'll need to connect ethernet cables from this patch panel to the router. And then put wifi access points in the rooms where you need connected to the ethernet jacks. \n\nEven better is if you connect non mobile devices, like a TV with ethernet.",

Your mobile equipment will switch automatically to the one with the strongest signal.\n\nBut you will also need to figure out beforehand where each Ethernet wall socket is connected to.\n\nIf you have simply Cat5 and not Cat5e, then you can only expect to get up to 100Mbps through them, so you won’t really need expensive WiFi routers.\n\nA WiFI extender is generally used to extend an existing WiFi signal keeping the same AP SID - however depending on your residence,, this may not be so good, and possibly more expensive than cheaper Wireless routers.",

Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[6][7] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.",

Since the signal is very short and relatively weak, a single button cell can power an AirTag for up to a year, so if your concern is battery life or data quota, you're fine.\n\nPrivacy-wise, the payload is encrypted, so it's not trivial for random strangers to link which device belongs to which Apple ID, or even what type of device is transmitting the signal. However, iPhones will alert you if a stranger's airtag that didn't see its owner for a prolonged time (automatically marked as \"lost\") seems to be following you as a precaution against stalkers. It will also chirp to help owners find missing tags and warn potential stalking victims.\n\nThere is a slight battery drain to everyone's else iPhones nearby that doesn't disable their Find My network (the toggle works both way, for transmitting when offline and listening for other device), since they are the one that receive the signal and then forward it to Apple with their current location. Normally this comes to low priority queue (ie, it doesn't get sent unless your phone is also checking for new message & notification), but sometimes it bugged out, usually fixed in a day or two.\n\nCurrently, each vendor's network isn't compatible with the other, so for example your Samsung won't care about AirTag transmission, though for Apple specifically, there are bikes and non-Apple earbuds that use Find My. Google was supposed to join the game last year, but it doesn't seem to be complete yet, either due to technical or legal concerns. If they do join, I'd expect like Samsung and Apple there will be an option to opt-out from both transmitting and forwarding the tracker message. There are also plans to have the networks talk to each other, so an iPhone lost in countries that rarely use iPhones can still be found and vice versa.",

        "comment": "Well, you could try to repair it. Its likely one of two issues, or possibly both, either the power supply board, or the backlights are out. Neither part is probably extremely expensive. Typically just searching for model number and either backlights or power supply board will get you some hits. C715 may not be the full model number, you may want to check to verify that's correct, it may be something like 55C715 or something.\n\nEdit: should have mentioned there is also a 3rd possible part, a chance of it being the LED driver board.\n\nThen it's off to youtube, there are videos out there, but I couldn't quickly find one for C715 specifically, but there are other TCL models and watching the video of how to DIY would give you an idea as to if you are feeling handy enough to attempt this yourself. There are even some videos out there that give you more details on how to diagnose these issues specifically so you aren't guessing which part.\n\nBefore ordering your part(s), you'll probably want to open the TV up and look for part numbers on the power board and backlights as an extra means of verifying you have the correct parts before ordering. TV Model number should work in most cases, but it's never a bad idea if you can verify by the specific part number or make sure the picture matches what you have before ordering. Saves you time and grief if trying to return something.\n\nAlternately, if you don't feel like you can tackle this by yourself, or don't feel comfortable, then if you post in a local sub (if available) there may be someone near you that offers repair services that would tackle it for you. Or if you know someone that is electronic savvy or does things for a hobby they may be willing to attempt. For someone that has done some small electronic work before, it wouldn't be a huge burden to attempt something like this.\n\nI recommend taking lots of photos as you are disassembling so you can refer to them later in case you forget how it goes back together.\n\nGood luck. Hopefully you get it fixed up again.",

It arrived nonfunctional like this despite being new unopened. I contacted Acer and unfortunately as there was no purchase, there was no receipt nor warranty. They ultimately declined to repair or replace it. Their choice, it being nonfunctional became part of the review they paid to get, since I couldn't test it for more than 10 minutes.\n\nI'm willing to pay a couple hundred for a charging port, battery etc, to get it working, but I believe I'll pass if it needs a motherboard. Just needed clarification if this shop was correct saying it needs something that significant.",

I would recommend checking your configuration on the relevant router or access point to ensure that your pc isn’t being blocked.\n\nOn the pc end of things, the only thing that I could see happening is that maybe installing an older driver version may assist with this issue? Though that’s probably not the case if you can connect to other wireless networks. Also, if you have a laptop, then you may want to check your battery settings as I have seen where Windows had a power setting that can drop the wifi if the battery gets too low. Hope this helps.",

Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[6][7] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.",

Yes I'm aware Australia uses 240V @ 50Hz power. If the monitor expects an 240V @ 50Hz input, now you're feeding it 120V @ 60Hz using a passive adapter, it obviously won't work. You need to check what power input it supports. You might need a step-down transformer to prove suitable power. If you've damaged the monitor because of feeding it the wrong power, it may not be possible to repair.",

Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[6][7] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.",

If it supports S3 Sleep you can try adding this to the registry. Note that most registry changes requires a reboot to apply.\n\nIt can still be storage. When going into a deeper sleep state it moves a lot of data from RAM onto the storage and loads it back in when you wake it.

Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[6][7] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.",

The most reliable way of finding a bad DIMM with DDR4 and newer is to use the system as you normally would (so, NOT running memory diagnostics) but with only one DIMM installed to see if the problems stop in the configuration. Then do the same but with the other DIMM installed instead - the idea being to isolate a faulty DIMM since it's rare for more than one to be bad. Have you tried that?\n\nedit: Also, assuming the system is stable in the BIOS settings menus (not freezing or showing text/graphics glitches) I'd recommend updating to the latest BIOS for your motherboard as they often include stability/compatibility/performance fixes even if they aren't mentioned in the change notes.",

The memory controller is in the CPU and when this fails it just looks like RAM. Zen 2 CPUs (The architecture of your CPU) also has a quirk where a faulty CPU will almost always look like RAM.\n\nIf anything is overclocked or undervolted, remove it. Check the BIOS' overclocking section for Precision Boost Overdrive and if it's not disabled then disable it.\n\nYou can also try updating the BIOS.

Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[6][7] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.",

It looks same as windows, but it will run much faster (from personal experience, it was able to revive machine with N4000 CPU and 4GB ram & 64GB internal flash, which windows was unable to work with).",

Dump files are crash logs from BSODs.\n\nIf you can get into Windows normally or through Safe Mode could you check C:\\Windows\\Minidump for any dump files? If you have any dump files, copy the folder to the desktop, zip the folder and upload it. If you don't have any zip software installed, right click on the folder and select Send to → Compressed (Zipped) folder.\n\nUpload to any easy to use file sharing site. Reddit keeps blacklisting file hosts so find something that works, currently catbox.moe or mediafire.com seems to be working.\n\nWe like to have multiple dump files to work with so if you only have one dump file, none or not a folder at all, upload the ones you have and then follow this guide to change the dump type to Small Memory Dump.

Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[6][7] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.",

Perhaps a make/model name written on it ?\n\nAlso, did the ISP provide this equipment ?\n\nAnd are you able to login to the WiFI extender ? (If the ISP provided this equipment, then they may have provided details of how to do so.)\n\nI have used an old 2 port Wifi extender in a similar setup before however… My extender was connected by Ethernet cable to the home router and obtained its IP address from there, and my PC connected to the other port obtained its IP Address from the home router. So basically through the extender I was simply adding WIFI to a non-wifi home router. In your case, I suspect that one of the LAN Ports has been configured as the WAN connection (internet facing) whilst the 2nd LAN port is the real LAN port through which your PC received its LAN IpAddress from the Extender. LAN1 would therefore be the WAN port and LAN2 the sole LAN port. If you have a Smart device it’ll work the same way even if you switch the wires around, but there’s no speed benefit for doing so.",

I'd look at starting with some kind of CMS/Wiki or document management system to serve as the core of your solution, and building out from there with specific products/plugins as required. For example MediaWiki, WordPress, Tiki, Nextcloud as a core, then expand into things like PhotoPrism, webtrees etc for dedicated features. But that sub will have better recommendations.\n\nMore important than the way you structure and present this data is how you protect it.

However, there are more general rules that, for example, will require the employer to make sure that the installed operating systems are properly secured and that they have the latest updates/patches installed, etc. which is all stuff your employer won't be able to provide assurances on if you just go install another OS by yourself.",

This should probably just be stickied in every tech related subreddit and website on the internet. Work devices are for work. You don't own them, an you don't control them. Don't use them for personal tasks. It may violate your company's computer use policy, which may be grounds for administrative action if your company enforces it. It may put your company's data at risk. More importantly for you, you are accessing personal data and accounts on a device you don't own. Forget the company -- what about your privacy? It's none of the company's business what websites you go to, programs you use, accounts you have, etc. Why make it their business by doing it on a work device?",

Dump files are crash logs from BSODs.\n\nIf you can get into Windows normally or through Safe Mode could you check C:\\Windows\\Minidump for any dump files? If you have any dump files, copy the folder to the desktop, zip the folder and upload it. If you don't have any zip software installed, right click on the folder and select Send to → Compressed (Zipped) folder.\n\nUpload to any easy to use file sharing site. Reddit keeps blacklisting file hosts so find something that works, currently catbox.moe or mediafire.com seems to be working.\n\nWe like to have multiple dump files to work with so if you only have one dump file, none or not a folder at all, upload the ones you have and then follow this guide to change the dump type to Small Memory Dump. The \"Overwrite dump file\" option will be grayed out since small memory dumps never overwrite.\n\nI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns.",
