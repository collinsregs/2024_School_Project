It has nothing to do with strings being immutable. But when the function returns this doesn't change the object that the \"name\" variable is referencing.\n\n``` def func(val): val = val + \"hello\"\n\nname = \"Joe\" func(name) print(name) ```\n\nWhereas the following Python code will print [\"The\", \"Bob\"] because the function is passed a reference to the object that is given in function call (a list object). The first statement in the function changes that list object. The second line of the function changes what object the \"words\" variable is referencing but that doesn't change what object the \"names\" variable is referencing.\n\n``` def func(words): words[0] = \"The\" words = \"Hello\"\n\nnames = [\"Joe\", \"Bob\"] func(names) print(names) ```\n\nThis is the same way that Java, Ruby, Smalltalk and most other modern fully object oriented languages pass object arguments to functions/methods.\n\nBTW: Strings happen to be immutable in Python but are mutable in Smalltalk. It's useful to have some objects that are immutable. Smalltalk has an object that is very much like a String but is immutable called a Symbol.",

And I didn't see anything in your demo code that was Rust or RSGI specific.\n\nPerhaps RSGI is a general HTTP server gateway (like Nginx), written in Rust, and your library provides a way for Python to use RSGI to respond to specific HTTP urls?\n\nYeah, that makes more sense. In what way is RSGI different from WSGI? I assume RSGI is async. Is there already an async version of WSGI? I assume so. So in what way is RSGI an improvement on the async version of WSGI?",

It is fantastic when you have a lot of similar vids but not quite the same. If you are just assuming the AI is correct all the time and that it knows better than you do then that could be problematic. Alternatively, the AI tools could be used to help learn new things as well. I had something I wanted to do in postgres the other day so I told a comment for what I wanted and copilot popped out a postgres function I was not aware of. Rather than assuming correctness I looked up the function and endured it did what I wanted. It wasn't my intention to have copilot write that for me (I had planned to do it another way) but I did learn something new because I used AI. i guess it boils down to if you use it as a crutch or as an aid.",

PDAs ran WM2004, and it was never updated to handle the new DST dates. Every time you program the locks, it updates their internal clock from the PDA. Twice a year it'd wreak havoc with the auto-unlock schedule and they'd call me to complain that the bridge software I'd written to push access and schedule data to the Win XP virtual system that talked to the PDA \"was all fucked up\".

Tz2 could change and the meeting time could change for people in that timezone.\nStore only naive time if you want to let the consumer of the data interpret what point in time it actually happens. For example, a company could announce \"prices will increase starting November 1st 2024 [at your local timezone]\"\n\nHuman time/naive time is something like \"Feb 1 2024 7:30:51 PM\", without a timezone.\n\nAnd typically, you want to store the timezone/name; only storing the offset is less useful.",

Even accounting for DST and accepting the theory that every business wants to continually shift their hours to reflect daylight, the one hour shift of DST doesn't properly cover the actual fluctuations of daylight hours for many geographic locations. By your argument those businesses should be adjusting them multiple times throughout the season even with DST.\n\nI think that a lot of the people who advocate for summer clocks year round do not live close enough to the poles to be affected very much.\n\nThat's an odd assumption to make for multiple reasons, particularly when people can point to hard evidence like the spike in heart attacks following the time changes.

The things that are blocking me from making advancements on a task are very rarely the amount of time it takes to write the code.\n\nDevs might work with generative AI more often to prevent having to write out syntax, but someone still has to be responsible for reviewing that code, testing that code, understanding the scope of the code or feature that the code is implementing, and updating / fixing bugs in the code. Someone still has to report what the code does or change what the code does when decision makers realize that the requirements weren't actually correct.\n\nYou might be able to write syntax faster, but writing syntax isn't really the bottleneck in what makes a company need more developers. The mental capacity to understand and be responsible for what the code is doing is far more of an issue than how fast you can produce code. Eventually a code base gets to a size where parts of it need to be delegated for other people to maintain or be responsible for implementing new features to.\n\nGenerative AI doesn't remove the need for people to understand what code is doing, and that's far more of an issue than writing code faster is.",

It's that the whole LLM technique, while useful, isn't a huge game changer in terms of developer productivity.\n\nThe productivity of developers has been rising regularly for many years. More powerful programming languages (both new ones and new features in existing ones),ore sophisticated framework capabilities, automated refactoring tools, improvements to editors and IDEs (thanks to LSP you can now get productivity improvements in text editors that were once the preserve of an IDE), an easier to use ecosystem of third party libraries and so on have all had a significant effect on developer productivity. LLMs are probably one of the more significant improvements, but they certainly aren't the only ones.\n\nThere's plenty of additional scope for LLMs to be useful. For example, I can see a use case for smarter boilerplate generators, so I could run a console command to generate a controller class with specific functionality in mind. However in many ways they're dumb as rocks and will regurgitate all manner of shit that needs to be sorted out. And that isn't just a matter of the next generation sorting it out - it's more fundamental to the concept.\n\nIt's not ever going to produce original and innovative code and anyone who claims it is, is talking utter bollocks. That doesn't mean it won't improve developer productivity. It helps tremendously with a lot of grunt work like refactorings - I have had great success using it to add better types to Typescript or converting React components from classes to functions.\n\nThe people who really ought to worry about their jobs are customer service types. Those industries have been moving towards chat interfaces anyway and most work off a script. When all you need to do is a bit of semantic search to match a question to a stock answer your job can easily be done by an LLM.",

                        "comment": "I worked on a (SOAP based) web-service API for the NAIC back in the 2005-6 timeframe. The need was for a standardized way of transferring data back and forth between failed insurance companies that had been taken over by their state of domicile, and the NAIC. Once the data was at the NAIC, there would be a portal where customers of the failed companies with unpaid claims could go to file a proof-of-claim in the hopes that they might eventually get paid if the company survived receivership.\n\nBefore we even started on the technical requirements, there was a problem. Instead of having a single implementation of the API at the NAIC, that the various states would upload their data to, the plan was to have the NAIC define the API, which would then have to be implemented by every state for each of their failed insurance companies.\n\nThere were two primary reasons for this. First the NAIC did not want the responsibility for maintaining this service. Second, having a central service where the states pushed data into the NAIC meant that the states would have control over when the data was sent. This was unacceptable. The NAIC was the regulatory body, therefore *they* should have control over when the data was sent.\n\nThis inversion of responsibility meant that every state would need a webservices expert, something which few had since webservices were still brand new and shiny. My job was to do the following:\n\nDesign the API for transferring the claim data from the receivership.\nSince the actual implementation was to reside at the different states, the definition had to be platform-agnostic. So no SAAJ or MS DIME for file transfers. Files had to be split in to chunks, transferred, and then reassembled and virus-scanned at the other end.\nSince the actual platforms were varied, and since the states didn't necessarily have webservice experts, I had to create a reference implementation of the API for the following platforms: Windows VB.net, Windows C#, Unix C/C++ using gSOAP, and Java JAX-RPC (JAX-WS didn't yet exist).\nExplain to the states that the reference implementations are not complete, that they can't just plop one of them down on a server and call it day. At the very least, they still have to integrate their internal systems with the service implementation.\nDesign a portal web application to collect the information required by the state of domicile for a proof-of-claim. 50 different states means 50 different overlapping sets of information. The plan was to make it table driven from the database with workflows that depend on how certain questions are answered. So if a person is for example married, there might be additional questions about their spouse.\n\nI spent so much time doing #1, and trusting the other developer on the team to do #2 that when I found out that their implementation of #2 was... err... poorly done, I had to re-write the thing in 6 weeks working 15 hour days, 7-days a week.\n\nCompounding the issues was the fact that I was a newbie to Java at the time. So the portal application was absolutely wretched. The API was a bit better, and I got to write some interesting code, but the fact that the client and server responsibilities were inverted just made everything bad overall.",

On the one hand with only 4-5 prompts we dialed in something close to the expected code. But it would have taken 6-7 more prompts to exactly match the requirements. And you had to read the code and see where it got things wrong to guide it forward.\n\nIt also did things in very different ways than we were thinking. That was neither bad or good, but it was interesting to see that ChatGPT took our prompts literally rather than optimizing the logic.\n\nFinally I asked it to decode a quadrature encoder. This is a simple task that 99% of the code on the internet gets wrong. As expected it messed things up in the usual ways.\n\nOur takeaway was that you can use this like stack exchange. If you’re stuck and need something to point you in a new direction then ask. But assume the answer is sub optimal at best and flat out wrong at worst. It’s not going to replace paying someone to think anytime soon.\n\nThe concerning part to me is the over confidence. ChatGPT always gives an answer that looks good, even if it is making it up on the fly. I really wish it would quantify its confidence in the answer. Otherwise that will trip up people who are incapable of telling if it is right or not.",

Anything you look at is the end product of a lineage that began with someone in a cave painting with their hands.\n\nNone of these systems do that.

If you take one \"intro to python\" course that is pretty much what it would feel like. As though the skill is just knowing a language and doing some basic translation. And an LLM can surely do that trick reasonably well, so I suppose they guess you won't need a programmer anymore.\n\nBut I think the reality, at least for good programmers, is that they have to understand the domain and the technology, and then build a model for how the technology solves domain problems or supports domain activities. At least according to Naur in \"Programming as Theory Building\", this is the job. Importantly, much of the theory that Naur is talking about is tacit - not something that's in the code, and its hard to capture in documentation too.\n\nI don't believe current generations of LLMs have any theory about the world (or any domain in it) or how code relates to them. I'm not sure at all that AI won't someday be able to do that. But at that point, every other job out there will also have been replaced. Almost tautologically, the people who can express domain theories to a computer will be the last ones out of a job, if the task is to replace all jobs.",

The issue is the emotional intelligence required to properly manage some of the more difficult situations are gonna be a pretty tall order for managers, even good ones.\n\nThis is why I strongly believe in blameless meeting culture, especially for retrospectives, because there is no value in pointing out who broke the thing, but there is value in figuring out how otherwise smart people are allowed to do stupid things. For example, if interns keep pushing to main and rollbacks keep need to be done, why the hell are people allowed to merge to main without a pull request?\n\nAs for the idiots that can’t seem to learn, that’s a managerial situation and a private matter, just like you said. The only accomplishment I have ever seen of public bashing like this is the lowering of morale.",

So much s, r, _ => nonsense which is unreadable. I’ve shown it to folks all across the company and the response that stuck with me the most was from a staff engineer on our frontend platform team who was looking at the 400 lines of boilerplate to set up a NameComponent with first, middle, last as, “this seems like an enormous amount of code to instantiate three fields”. We didn’t need a generic like field generator thing we are fine to actually set up the 3 fields or whatever in the component!!!\n\n/rant",

Maybe they found this code effective but it’s not readable at all. Worse, it loops through these components to generate them with functions returning JSX, not actual react components, which I know for sure (and confirmed) is actually bad react hook code.

Tar is the obvious one, but you can’t export over NFS etc., right? You need a distinct fileid even in ro or you’ll get strange behavior. At the least you’ll need to turn off delegation. And there’s a use-case for that since you can build an easy remote eventfs system with that in theory.\n\nBut I have to try this myself to see why this is a dumb idea.

At least for me it never really did anything, but make me emotional and angry at myself. It strengthens this idea that one would identify with ones own code. And that's BS.

For example, if your supermarket offers an app, it could use these beacons to track your precise movements through the store, for marketing purposes.\n\nSo you needed the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission, which also gives access to the precise GPS position, to scan for devices from the app. These days, there is the BLUETOOTH_SCAN permission, which covers just that, and the API asks you to honestly declare through an extra flag that you don't want to use the nearby devices to determine the position.
