This means all Nvidia GPUs that they make will have raytracing acceleration and AI coprocessors going forward across the board and they (for now) abandoning the entry level like HTPC that doesn't need Raytracing.\n\nAMD includes a pretty competent GPU now in every single new CPU. The G-Series is available for those who need an entry level GPU like a 1630, and doesn't take up an expansion slot or need separate cooling/power. Intel's also shipping H264/H265 decoding/encoding in most all of their CPUs so a plex server doesn't really need an entry level GPU either.\n\nAnd if someone does need a beefier rasterization/Video Codec card then there is Intel dGPU offerings on the ultra-low end. With AMD abandoning the high-end enthusiast market as well, that means Nvidia and AMD are stratifying and kind of ceding market to one another. Intel (rasterization and light work) < AMD (light raytracing) < Nvidia (path tracing)",

It's just that money is no longer cheap/free to borrow and so both investors and companies have to come to terms with that in the short to medium term. Once we're back to nearly 0% interest rates and the next \"hot\" tech thing comes along, they'll all go back to throwing stupid money at that company and the next 2-3 that purport to do the same/a similar thing like it's nothing. In fact, I wouldn't even say they've stopped throwing money at stuff even right now, it's just that AI is THE one thing every investor is throwing money at, it's just in the form of a half dozen different companies right now and there's no clear winner yet, even though OpenAI seems like the front runner.",

Then, they die. I call this enshittification, and it is a seemingly inevitable consequence arising from the combination of the ease of changing how a platform allocates value, combined with the nature of a \"two sided market\", where a platform sits between buyers and sellers, hold each hostage to the other, raking off an ever-larger share of the value that passes between them.‚Äù\n\nEdit: typo",

This just started in the last month. It is incredibly obnoxious. Sometimes happens more than once during the same video.\n\nTCL's youtube app starts an audio ad at startup and after a video, every time (it didn't do this when I bought it).\n\nAnd I am not onboard with the 'accept or your TV is bricked' terms.\n\nI will be shopping for a new TV that is neither TCL nor uses the Roku OS.",

TCL, Hisense, LG, Sony, and Samsung use the same chipsets for their TVs.\n\nRoku is dying on the mid-range to high end, they are only really around on the lower end of TVs.\n\nSamsung and LG use their own OS, Sony, Hisense, and TCL use Google for their current TVs. Visio also has their own OS FWIW, but they just got bought by Walmart, and their newest TV competes at the midrange but is rather shit.\n\nYour best bet is to pick a TV with a panel you like and install an Nvidia Shield or Apple TV, and never connect the TV to the internet. Don't look at the brands, under the skin they are basically the same shit in different packages.\n\nIf you can go OLED, do it, LG B series is around $1500 right now. Not bad. LG TVs seem to have the most EDID and CEC issues, so if you use a soundbar or AV receiver, you might run into issues. Samsung is generally reliable on that front, but their OS is plastered with ads way worse than a Google or Roku TV...\n\nWhich brings us back to panels. Buy the panel, add a box for the software you want, add a sound system for the sound you want. Don't buy a TV for the OS, and don't buy a TV for any added features like built in subwoofers (which are shit).",

So, why would Roku willingly sell its devices at a loss?\n\nWhen Roku filed its IPO prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ahead of its market debut, it provided a detailed overview of its business. Under the section describing its products, first on the list wasn't its smart TVs or streaming players, it was advertising. Roku's advertising business, which includes video ads, audience development for streaming services, and brand sponsorships, is the backbone of its platform.\n\nSo what do you think these new user terms are all about?\n\nThe reality is that the advertisement industry are ALL OVER smart TVs. They will be cheap, but you'll not be able to purchase one \"full price\" to avoid the advertising hellscape they will soon become.",

Finding a TV that requires internet to finish setting it up, that's uncommon.

This is covered in the GDPR (deletion and getting a download of the data are not mutually exclusive; you have a right to both).\n\nIf a company serves European customers, they must have infrastructure in place in order to accommodate these rights. Even light violations of the GDPR carry penalties such as $10 million or 2% of turnover from the preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher.\n\nMost globally operating companies seem to have settled for offering the same service to US/international customers as well. For example, Google will offer you a \"data takeout\", which is a download package that features each and every single piece of data that Google associates with your account. The YouTube videos you've clicked, the likes you left, the stuff you've googled, all the photos you have on Google photos, the songs you've played on YouTube music, etc. Youncan access all this through your account page. Google \"Google data takeout\"\n\nYou can either check if HP might actually have such systems in place for you, and if not, you can look for GDPR template letters/emails (under the GDPR companies cannot say they only accept a written request. If they don't accept email they are in violation).\n\nAll that being said, whether you can take advantage of this depends on the corporate structure of the company in question. If you made an account with \"HP of America\", for example, and its TOS explicitly state that they only offer their services to US citizens, you won't be able to take advantage of GDPR. I'm also not sure how it works if you selected a place of residence for your account that's outside the EU.\n\nI'm not from the US but I think there's also state specific legislation around data protection, so you might be able to take advantage of some of those.",

If this printer is accessible from the internet, and way too many are, then that web server can usually be broken into.\n\nOnce that is done you have options. One would be to copy every single print and send it somewhere else. Another would be to install some network data capture tools and see what other machine(s) you can get to. A third would be to install crypto mining software. Honestly it is just a remote server at that point so you can have it do whatever you want.",

The research you're talking about was effectively asking if this signal could be used to map through walls, as it's known that signals can map things in line of sight.\n\nSo these devices technically have had this capability since the dawn of wireless technologies, the mapping itself is more of a new thing.\n\nBats use this to see when flying, so it's not exactly an invented concept at the core that's exclusively stuck to wifi, in theory an advanced enough piece of software could map a room by you shouting.\n\nAnd frankly, the idea that wireless security is poor intentionally to allow this mapping is kinda dumb. There's no need for security to be bad when there's no physical barriers that are intentionally set up for wifi like this.\n\nLike at its core, anything that emits energy that can be captured somehow can map an area, as I mentioned, animals have done it for millennia.",

This uses just wifi waves and how they bounce around the room and house, despite also being able to penetrate objects.\n\nThe team that released videos on youtube used computer learning to help with the signal data analytics to make the images viewable. But the gist of it is, its not as clear as the movie, and since wifi can literally pass through walls, they can just see inside your house using your wifi, or theirs and its undetectible as nealry everyone uses wifi in their homes... The videos didnt show great detail, but general location of furniture, rooms/layout, and people doing stuff can be seen.\n\nI wouldnt put it past normal police of swat teams to be able to use this tech very soon.

The large controller with the touch screen (gamepad) allowed my young kids to play easily with a good view of the action (so they could see their hands and the screen at the same time, something that is more difficult at a young age if the controller is down by their lap while the content is being played on a TV on a wall), and that main controller/pad has been wildly robust and resilient -- it's survived a million falls, bangs, and bumps over the years. The fact that the console itself is high and out of the reach of the younger kids reduces the risk of a console-ending accident (unlike, say, dropping the Switch at an unlikely angle/time/height). We've put a looooot of hours of Super Mario Bros U, Super Mario 3D World (which my kids call \"Kitty Mario\"), Mario Kart 8, Mario Galaxy 2 (from the Wii shop), and LoZ Wind Waker.

Color LCDs were just becoming a thing at that time but they were enormously expensive and used like 3x the power than the screens the OG gameboy ended up using. They were dead set on the low price point so they avoided the more attractive color LCDs.\n\nThat made it technically less impressive but far more affordable both in up front costs and battery costs. And Nintendo had their awesome IPs and supported it with great games and got good third party support too.\n\nAnd yeah, similar story with the Wii. Similar with the DS vs PSP. Similar with the Switch.\n\nDefinitely some differences in exactly how and why that story played out. But underpowered, cheaper price, and quality first party support are the common recurring themes with a lot of their successes.\n\nI think their focus on affordability goes back to their history as a toy company, not an electronics or video game company.",
