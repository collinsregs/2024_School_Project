You can draw a dashed border for the vertical line, and use a :before pseudo selector for a solid border for the horizontal line (which you transform to position at a 90 degree angle).\n\nThen position the hr's absolutely, relative to the container they should be on. Tadaaaaah.\n\nBut whether that's the best solution is tough to say. Will that dark background expand when content is injected ? What is the content ? Text ? Will those dividers logically separate columns ? (then rethink above suggestion and draw onto the corners of a the container element of choice).\n\nEither way, its not really a React problem, its a matter of first semantically structuring what you want to show in HTML, then thinking whether pure CSS can meet this design using your DOM structure, if not, then you can look at something else (SVG is likely the easiest in case the lines are static and wont expand to match dynamic content height)",

UX comes from the deliberate implementation of your UI so it is intuitive and human, you get average UX from understanding your app and users, but you need to put time and thought into what decisions are being made and why to have a great functional app. I recommend Hotjar to spy on your users monitor user behaviour",

How do you respond when you don't know an answer, or when you need help? What kind of personality really gets on your nerves?

You could even have been more than qualified and still get turned down for a ridiculous reason. If I remember correctly, the guy who created Homebrew got turned down by Apple for not being qualified, even though engineers at Apple use his software (I know this for a fact). There's also a lead engineer for a major JavaScript framework who told me he got turned down from a Silicon Valley job (can't remember which one) because they believed he wasn't qualified, even though his code supports countless production applications.\n\nIn your situation, I would have just told the interviewers that I'm feeling anxiety and that I'll do my best. If trivia questions are more important than 15+ years of experience or who you are as a person, then screw 'em. If I'm interviewing someone, I don't even ask such questions if I can avoid it. I think it's more important to get a sense of what kind of coworker they will be and how they approach writing software (without the help of things like Copilot). But many software engineers don't think this way. To them, the interview process is a game of one-upsmanship until they decide to hire someone for an arbitrary reason. That's just how it is sometimes.\n\nAs someone who's done some fairly non-trivial mathematic tasks in coding projects, and whom has written software for one of the biggest employers in the world, I've screwed up on coding challenges that other programmers believed were appropriate for an interview. They say that it's not the answer that matters, but that's usually horseshit. Most programmers are not skilled at interviewing but can hawk corporatisms while they judge you on things that don't actually matter. It's gonna happen to you and everyone.

A lot of these do not have support for Vue3 and I'd have to find new ones or build them myself. All of that will take a lot of time but also give me a lot of headaches.\n\nThen there's also just a lot of stuff this project doesn't have. No typescript support, eslint won't work properly, all hardcoded text so no i18n options, horrible accessibility, and it's grown so out of hand in components that Google won't index my pages because it stops loading because there's too many files during the initial load thanks to auto-codesplitting.\n\nYes all of these things are absolutely fixable in small iterations with some effort, but I'm afraid it will just give me a lot of headaches and take the joy out of the project for me.

I agree, introducing i18n and TS to a several year long project is a major PITA, but migrating existing JS code to TS won't magically happen in your new project, even though you'll have TS support from the very beginning. You will still need to do a lot of manual work, regardless if you do it in the old or the new codebase.\n\nAlso, I should have mentioned that I've had a personal project with 10k monthly visitors written in React/JS and started rewriting it to TS with \"better coding standards\". Turns out the mess you make is usually there due to \"product\" decisions and will happen each time you rewrite. I have also witnesses a legacy mobile app rewrite at my workplace because it was \"buggy and outdated\". Guess what, year and a half after the rewrite, 70% of the original issues came to bother us again\n\nAlso, the only fun projects are the ones without a real user base. After people start using your app, then those projects become a responsibility. For this reason, I'd suggest picking a new project to write from scratch using a shiny new tech stack and keep pushing new features for the current project. There's a different type of fun to be found besides code: making up new features, investigating market, interacting with users, monetization strategies...\n\nI do have a strong opinion on this topic, but it might turn great for you and be doable in a reasonably short amount of time, though. :)",

I don't know anyone who willingly writes modern PHP without a framework. Heck, a recent job I had used some \"no framework\" PHP, and even that was based on an in house framework. The only redeeming factor here is that they seem to want a CLI application.\n\nAlso, they want MVC for a CLI application? They're off their rocker. I'd vomit all this into a single file, or maybe 2, and call it a day. No need for MVC or any of those shenanigans.\n\nAnd they want internationalization support? On a CLI application? In 3 hours? Forgive me, my American is showing, but I'm not aware of a terminal emulator with proper right to left support, much less support for Arabic script. Just supporting the translations would likely take 3 hours.\n\nI don't think I've seen a less realistic assignment.",

I don't think that's unrealistic.\n\nThe idea that this could be done in 3 hours is completely nuts.\nAsking for MVC for what is essentially a shell script is the definition of over-engineering.\nRequiring internationalization support for a shell script is misguided at best.\nImplementing internationalization, specifically right to left support and non-latin character sets, for a shell script is difficult at best given the state of terminal emulators. Arabic script in particular doesn't get along with the monospace rendering in terminal emulators. (Again my American might be showing, so correct me if I'm wrong.)\n\nI would re-write the assignment to be a basic web site using applicants choice of framework and give them a weekend. I would make it clear that a minimal UI of basic HTML and enough CSS to make it usable was acceptable. Additionally, if internationalization was important I would ask that the applicant demonstrate the correct function calls for translation within the view. Data would be provided in a sqlite db. I would require them to log their time, but make it clear that the quality of the application was the deciding factor, and they should take time to \"do it right\".\n\nReally, if I were a interviewing and my company required that I do a \"written\" technical examination, I would argue for paying the candidate for 3 hours of work, then have them pair with me on an existing ticket within the the product. This would tell me way more about their ability to solve a problem than a take home, it would get production work done, and it wouldn't be taking advantage of the candidate.\n\nI understand this is a PHP test, but if they provided this assignment to me with a CSV file and told me to do it in 3 hours in any language, I'd do it in 20 minutes as a shell script. Awk can process a CSV well enough to get the job done in a couple seconds or less for CSV files up to a couple gigabytes. It would be faster, more maintainable, and actually use the right tools.",

I would estimate this to take me about an hour, so three hours for an inexperienced programmer, who has a solid understanding of the fundamentals, seems pretty reasonable. That said, if I were the hiring manager, I wouldn‚Äôt balk if a junior engineer took 10, if it were a good solution.\n\nIn my own field, I noticed that over the pandemic, people were hiring engineers like crazy. It was easy to get a job or a raise. This seems to have been true in webdev as well, at least from an outside perspective, and it‚Äôs had a lot of ripples when it comes to thinks like definitions of seniority and salaries. In the last year, that has cooled a lot in my industry, and I get the impression that it has in webdev as well.

Very ultra-junior stuff. You don't need a framework or litteraly anything special than vanilla OOP PHP,\n\nIt's good they give much details about the approach you should take.",

Maybe not always three hours, but you should know what to google.\n\nFor the rest of you, you are going to be locked out of the more interesting and demanding jobs in our profession if you can't handle a take-home like this.",

It highlights that HTML and CSS are more efficient, performant, and accessible compared to JS, which can fail to load or exclude certain users. The article provides practical examples like creating custom switches with checkboxes and CSS instead of JS, using native HTML datalist for auto-suggestions, implementing color pickers without JS, creating accordions with HTML 'details' and 'summary' elements, and using the native 'dialog' element for modals. The post also mentions future web development features like scroll-driven animations, masonry layouts without JavaScript, a stylable 'selectlist' element, and the ':has()' selector, encouraging developers to re-evaluate their reliance on JavaScript for certain functionalities.\n\nIf you don't like the summary, just downvote and I'll try to delete the comment eventually üëç",

For example I wanted to use this project also as a way to learn express.js.\n\nBut maybe I can still have that godot server, and have another server that manages a database and has a rest api, and then have the godot server call that api to synchronize with the database, and that can be called much less frequently.\n\nDoes this make sense?",

But most logging of any kind takes place in the website's codebase, not via the HTTP server, which is usually some software that's just installed on the server rather than custom written. These probably do have an option to enable logging, but website developers are generally going to implement logging in the much easier and useful language they wrote the site in. That way, they can use things such as the path, the user agent string, cookies, etc.\n\nHosting providers and the companies involved in the network end of things might and probably do log traffic... Might not log the IP address unless they have reason to (like suspicious behavior), but they probably at least log to measure how many requests they handle. Will vary by company. I'm not sure if they typically share what they do and don't log... You'd have to figure out which company you'd be dealing with and their specific policy.\n\nThe TLS handshake takes place before their code can execute. It's for negotiating how to send the request that their code will be responding to.\n\nBut, assuming it is logged... It's probably just the IP address and the time. There's no information sent that'd say what path (after the .com in the URL) is being requested, no cookies, no user agent string. It'd be pretty difficult to tell how long you were on the site, especially if you got an error like it looks you did, and the handshake didn't even complete, since... What could they possibly use to determine that? It's from a single request and they need a second request at minimum to determine how long your visit lasted... And you failed to connect to begin with, and the error page you're seeing isn't from them.\n\nFor completeness, if you had visited this site recently, TLS 1.3 has a way to resume a session, and that could possibly be used to associate your browser/IP with session data such as cookies. So... If you were browsing the site and somehow got this error after having successfully connected, there might be session data as well. Probably not though.",

Pretty much every http webserver (apache, nginx) has logging enabled by default and you have to actively turn it off.

When you fill out a form, especially one that has sensitive info, you are performing a mentally challenging task (e.g. making sure the passport number is absolutely correct). When you submit, you need a few seconds to ease off and just chill. Giving an immediate response can cause further stress.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, not every website uses the best technology and server set up. Most websites cannot (and do not need to) be blazing fast. So most users are used to 1-4 seconds of waiting.\n\nFrom a marketing point of view, the delay might be to some tracking/analytics code running in the background.\n\nIt‚Äôs true that sometimes we need to intentionally slow it down as in the example of debouncing and throttling.

If so, then no, you don't really need the spinner.\n\nBut if there is ever a case where there is a delay, for any user, for any reason, the spinner can be useful to indicate to the user that something is happening but just not fast enough. A big one might be form submission, there might be some front end validation and then some processing and then a redirect, but you don't want people to think that nothing is happening even though it only takes 2 seconds. You don't want them trying to spam submit, so maybe you'll disable the button or at least make it look disabled. But then users might think nothing is happening and it's broken. Hence the spinner to say \"I'm still working\".\n\nAs /u/08148693 said though, a big reason is still the legacy trust issue. Older demographics often times, still won't accept how quickly things can happen. The mentality of how slow tech should be, or how long something takes if you are through, affects their perception of what's happening on the site. For us, if something is slow we take it as \"man this site must be coded like shit, it's slow slow, IDK if I trust it.\" For them it's \"that was too fast, there is no way it can be accurate and that fast, i don't trust it\". As that generation is removed, the need to \"slow things down\" will start to reduce over time. When you look at the zoomer and alpha gen, they expect everything to just be near instant. Millennials and older gens still remember how long it took for a single jpg to load over dialup.\n\nI still use them for AJAX form submissions since it's relevant when waiting for the API to respond.

Using spinners or loading bars consistently across the app can maintain a uniform experience, setting a standard expectation for interactions.\nPerceived Performance: Interestingly, in some cases, these indicators can create a perception of thoroughness or sophistication in the process, which might be important in applications where trust and reliability are crucial.\nGuiding User Focus: Loading animations can also be used to strategically direct the user's attention to certain elements once the loading is complete, enhancing the overall flow and interaction with the application.",

Given your background and what you're aiming to accomplish, I'd nudge you towards giving Meteor JS a shot.\n\nIt's akin to a Swiss Army knife for the JavaScript space: comprehensive, yet manageable for someone not deeply entrenched in the complexities of software development. I dare say it's the fastest web app prototyping tool out there.\n\nOne of the perks of Meteor is its integration with popular front-end frameworks like React and Vue, making it a versatile choice for crafting your user interfaces. You get the simplicity of using the same language across your stack, and with your Python background, you'll likely find JavaScript's transition quite approachable (you will need to learn js anyway!). You also get user management, built in reactivity (don't abuse it though!), and a lot of other goodies that \"just work\" so you can focus on your actual functionality.\n\nDisclaimer: We are a Meteor shop, so this reply is somewhat biased. But it's definitely one of the quickest ways to get up and running with your app. Takes some time to master though, but I guess that can be said about any framework.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions. Good luck!",

You inherently learn and grow as you continue doing stuff, and to think that that won't happen as you continue for years doing this I think reveals something else inside you that needs work. It's not your skills that are in question. I think you might want to talk this through with someone dear to your or a therapist. No disrespect intended. But insecurity, and imposter syndrome as a whole, is a real thing that needs to be handled and will affect every aspect of your life, either negatively or positively.",

Depending on where you go and who you talk to you might hear otherwise, but quality is superior to quantity. That may not be what some employers want to hear, maybe they want both, but that doesn't mean you need to worry yourself over what you are bringing, over what you can provide. Take it at your pace.\n\nThere is some employer, some company, some job, some position that requires exactly what you bring to the table and you'll excel at it. You just have to find your niche.\n\nThis mental adjustment applies to so much more than just programming, it affects all aspects of your life; which, I might add, all contribute to your programming abilities/limitations. It all requires moderation and balance and driving yourself into the ground for not being \"good\" enough certainly won't help any ambitions, programming or not.\n\nAt the end of the day the only person you are competing against is who you were yesterday.
