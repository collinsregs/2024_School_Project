This does line up with what I've seen and heard - a lot of people have bad experiences with doctors because there's just actually quite a few bad doctors out there, an unavoidable reality of employing people. One thing AI would uniquely bring is consistency - it would never get tired of giving the same advice a thousand times.\n\nAnd where will they scrape the data for this medical advice? Who will check and double check that it's accurate?   Like anything else, knowledge isn't static, it evolves. \n\nScraping is only one form of data collection. User feedback is commonly incorporated into the training data, and with a sensitive use case like this, I'd expect a market to emerge for professional QA on these AIs, much like how other scaled processes get QA tested by random selection or by taking user surveys.

I can only assume he felt about McDonnell-Douglas back then the way we’re feeling about Boeing now, and rode with us if a worst-case scenario happened (and it’s a shame cause his BIL worked his entire career at Boeing until he retired in the early 90s, and so did most of his cousins from that branch of the family; there was definitely some family pride in taking Boeing jets).",

The effect of Ketamine eventually stops working for most people, and it doesn't take a very long time. I mean ever since I saw the part about his Ketamine use, I realized just how bad it must be for him, because from the outside, his behavior these past few years have been incredibly self-destructive. I mean self-destructive on a gargantuan scale. That's a massive red flag that someone is in some extreme emotional distress deep down inside. And I feel bad for anyone who's in that position, and I hope he can find the time to get better before self-destruction isn't enough anymore.",

Some people can’t bring themselves to look at the unknown from a positive perspective.\n\nusually the facts that make me skeptical about a drug is a bigger motivation for me to go and experience the drug to formulate my own opinions on them.\n\nI don’t really care if people use/used the drug but at least inform yourself better on what they’re used for.

It's common to stay indoors and not risk being a hazard on the road for you or anyone else during these ice days.\n\nYup. No snow plows, no salt trucks, no big hoarded mounds of salt and grit to keep essential roads even somewhat clear, and (unless they used to live somewhere it snows routinely) nobody owns snow tires or chains or has a clue how to drive safely on snow and ice. It is a completely different ballgame than trying to drive in snow/ice in places where this happens every winter and everybody's prepared for it. The majority of places just completely shut down.\n\nI do have a hilarious memory from college involving this, though. I was an out-of-state student at a university in the deep South during a year where that region got a freak blizzard. ...and because I spent my time between semesters (including winter) somewhere where getting completely snowed in wasn't uncommon, I happened to have snow chains stashed in my car and was one of very few people in town who could actually drive around effectively, so I ended up ferrying a bunch of friends to a fairly sizable \"let's just hang out and low-key party until it melts and the university opens back up\" gathering at a friend's apartment. IIRC, Uber wasn't really a thing back then, but if it had been, I could have made a lot of money for a few days.",

He suggests that the tests could be a legal bar exam, logic tests, economic tests or perhaps the ability to pass a pre-med exam.

A highly anthropomorphic view of what AGI even is. None of this makes sense. Which is the point. The definitions are all muddy as hell. We have no real metrics in which to evaluate the things we are saying. AGI, general intelligence, like humans, but how general is human intelligence? But conscious like humans?

But it's wild to somehow make this a \"think of the children\" issue. You get your kid a phone, you can decide what games they're allowed to play, they have no ability to spend money on anything unless you're setting them up with credit/debit info.\n\nAre you gonna drop a 10 year old off at the mall with your unrestricted credit card and then blame the shiny advertisements? It's not \"24/7\" supervision, it takes a few minutes to have basic responsibility and set up your kids accounts. Even the grimiest companies like EA already have options for you to set up parental control with spending limits and playtime limits etc.\n\nBecause people have already been fighting to make companies take responsibility, and with results. They provide child accounts and parental controls, payment locks, monitoring and notifications. If that's not good enough then the parents are either lazy or upset that they have to take the blame for telling their little angel \"no\"",

No. I used it to make cool swords out of sticks, make boats, cut fruit or other snacks or whatever else a knife can be useful for.\n\nBut, a knife is a useful tool, and learning how to use and care for it is a useful skill to have as an adult. Otherwise you get people like the guy who cut the tip of his fingers off cutting a fuse for explosives during military training. He looked like he'd never handled a knife in his life for anything other than eating. The only reason he only cut the tip of his finger off and didn't slice his thigh is because the officer overseeing the training saw him in time and told him not to use his leg as a cutting board. So he used his finger instead.\n\nLike it or not, phones and other technologies are a large part of our lives and arguably more useful in today's world than a knife. Learning how to use them responsibly is part of growing up. Just like my knife was a small 6cm pocket knife and not a machete, parents need to teach kids how to responsibly use technology from an early age.",

Look at these sites like character AI: some people already are already able to spend hours creating, toying with, and speaking to AI simulations (at least, simulated to the best ability of the person who typed in the parameters, and depending on whatever AI model was used) of various characters. It's its own medium of entertainment, essentially.\n\nNow, look at a video game. Let's use a \"smaller\" open-world game as an example here, say, Fallout 3. Now, every location in Fallout 3, every character, has been crafted to serve a purpose. However, the game is designed with an overarching story in mind: there's many, many sidequests, places to go, and things to do, to be fair, but at the end of the day, every character, object, sidequest, etc., is just \"lore\", a brief diversion that you experience, before inevitably returning to world exploration, and more specifically, the main story, which can be completed in a few dozen hours.\n\nNow, keep in mind that most NPCs have only a few lines of dialogue at a time, or a few selectable dialogue options: they serve their purpose and never overstay their welcome. But imagine even one of them gets this AI treatment: well, if it added some basic background and breadth to their personify, that's one thing. But, if the developers decided to give every NPC, or even a handful of NPCs, their own little AI-generated personalities, similar to what we might find on a site like Character AI? Not only would it serve as a major distraction from the game's world and plot at large, but it would also significantly ruin the scope and pacing; You're spending three hours having fascinating conversations with the citizens of vault 101, when in reality, you could have been out of the vault and across the map in that same time-frame. Plus, how much AI-generated content that those NPCs give you, is actually relevant to the game's specific plots or sub-plots?\n\nI don't know about ya'll, but in a single-player game, I like to clock in my seven hours (or a dozen, or two dozen, or a hundred, depends on the game) of playtime, maybe do all the side content, or all the achievements if you're a completionist; and then call it a day, at least put the game away for a few years. I don't need my games prolonged indefinitely due to infinite AI-generated content; there's enough games on my backlog as it is, and there's specific sites that already cater to near-infinite AI-content anyway.",

I work with these things every day, I'm very much no \"luddite\", or \"naive\". In fact, I'm quite a big fan of technology's Potential if used for the right reasons and purposes. (and I absolutely love Sci-Fi and the kinds of questions it asks).\n\nI also used to be a professional Screenwriter, having written for TV and Film projects for companies like Dreamworks, Hasbro, Cartoon Network, and more. I also used to be a professional Narrative Designer, working with one of the highest-grossing mobile game companies around. And I also have written Audiobooks and songs for one of the most popular meditation apps with millions of subscribers per year.\n\nI know quite a lot (and probably quite a lot more than you) about narrative, writing, and AI and its capabilities and potential.\n\nAI is trained, and solely survives, on people's output. AI trained on itself gets worse and worse until it collapses, as OpenAI et al have released specific studies on. What makes a piece of art \"good\" isn't virtuosity or all-encompassing-ness - in fact, those have never been the thing, as evidenced by the fact that people have mastered the heights of virtuosity in every medium for hundreds of years, and has never been the reliable measure in itself of greatness. However, the content resonates based on its place in the world, as reflected and channeled via the experience of an actual person living in and being affected by the world, manifest in sound/word/image/motion expressed in that moment.\n\nYes, AI is an exciting thing beyond measure, a wonderful tool, and even a wonder itself as we look to the future of what sentience means, and what creativity means in relation to humans.\n\nBut I am quite correct when I say: A handcrafted game will always ring truer. AI certainly can be used consciously as a targeted part of that crafted architecture, but it would need to be deployed as a tool to fit a purpose trained on content humanly-hand-crafted for that dialogue deployment to be worthwhile in the construction of that design.\n\nYou get snotty when you see something you disagree with and don't understand, when you could instead consider you might not be the master of every domain, and if you participated in earnest in a conversation, you might learn something, and build something better, together.\n\nAddendum: Maybe if AI evolves to be embodied within our world and subject to the same systems we are, and generate its own continuous data from its own self-experience, then its creation will evolve too into its own form of hand-crafted. But I don't think that's what we're talking about.",

Think MCU characters quipping to fill in dead air.\n\nThis might be fine if you want your GTA 5 NPCs (for some reason) to have seemingly-casual conversations on their own. If you want the next Elder Scrolls or Fallout to use weird, unnatural, generated text like this instead, it might actually be an upgrade.\n\nBut I think all this is going to do is make your game feel emptier. If you implement it properly, it should reflect on altering the NPC's stats, goals, etc. So that either becomes a major gameplay aspect... Or like I said, it's just there to look shiny and take up more processing power while masking the fact that most dialogue nowadays is just fluff, born out of attempts to keep conventions as the technology has developed.",

In my experience, you have two types of people who love the humanities. Those who grew up reading late into the night under the covers with a flashlight, and those that thought they hated them until they had a really good teacher. Neither is a guarantee.\n\nMy college wasn’t too nuts about it, but instead of transferring history teachers over to comp sci, we had seminar level courses that EVERYONE had to take, which were far larger than a literature/ writing course really should be, and we’re all in total puff piece subjects. I took “History of rock and roll”, which seemed like a lark. Ended up being me and four other students participating in the presence of a bunch of bored B school kids. It didn’t help anyone lol. Plus I kinda resented it as an in major student. Can you imagine forcing the comp sci kids to take “Principals of Information Systems” in a cohort where 80% of the people did not want to be there?",

You’re paying more in taxes so the ultra wealthy can spend less to make more money.\n\nWe’d have millions and millions less people getting government aid if these companies paid real wages. Money that wouldn’t be taken out of your paycheck.\n\nAnd conservatives have been protecting this despite pretending to be for smaller government.\n\nRaising these wages would remove a lot of demand on these services and actually lower government expenditure.",

Half the appeal of this website is circumventing “the system” of ad supported news articles. Hell, most users don’t even read posted articles, they just read other user’s take on the articles. The other half of the appeal of this website is dark web-lite stuff like shit posting, memes, and porn. Every time Reddit tries to crack down on the behavior of its user base there’s a huge uproar - whether that’s because Reddit ham-fists the roll out or because of the intent of the change.\n\nJust my take but I don’t see a path to profitability for Reddit that doesn’t involve massively restructuring and isolating its core audience, or going down a really icky path of data mining and trying to sell user data harder than it already does.",

Congrats, that's a patent violation\n\nDid you write a new dating app that matches people based on the distance between them? You guessed it, patent violation.\n\nRecall corona and contact tracing app? You can bet there was a patent for that.\n\nDo you want to make an app that shows a map? That's right, you violated a patent. Despite the fact that this patent has prior art (MapQuest existed and had functionality described in the patent a full year before the patent was filled, but invalidating a patent due to prior art is too expensive for many smaller companies being sued)\n\nUnlike reddit, it costs patent maker nothing if people make an app using any of the above 'ideas,' which are things that realistically shouldn't have been patentable in the first place on the basis of being too obvious or overly broad.",

Also, to infringe, you need to be infringing on every element of the claim, not just one particular element. This example is a bit too conceptual to really consider, since in the state of today's computing, a lot of UI patents will fail under the obviousness bar. So we'd need to see what is actually being patented.\n\nOr shit like Nintendo filing a patent for a character, when stepping onto an object, being bound to that object's motion. In 2023. Y'know, shit games have been doing for decades.\n\nA few things on this point.\n\nOne, it is a patent filed in Japan. So it might not necessarily be enforceable in the US.\n\nSecond, even assuming it is patented in the US, if the implementation of the mechanic they are patenting (they're patenting the implementation, not the concept) has truly been used for decades, it will be barred due to not being novel.\n\nThird, as I alluded to prior, they're not actually patenting the concept, but rather the specific calculations done. Even then, the specific calculations have to be non-obvious at the time of filing.\n\nbut quite frankly the idea that you can just patent code and software design, when you didn't exactly take real materials and resources and invent some new way to use/assemble them, that's kinda bullshit.\n\nIt takes intellectual power, does it not? This is like saying the people who invented Arabic numerals didn't actually invent Arabic numerals because there's nothing tangible being produced or used. Are people not allowed to patent purely intellectual inventions simply because of the medium it's in? In a different way, you're also making the argument that esports aren't actually sports because there's no physical sport being played.\n\nLike, you can copyright a book - in so far as you can copyright characters aesthetically and their names, names of items, areas, etc. But you can't copyright, like, the word \"wizard\" because it's so broad, and you can't copyright the literal concept of magic existing, either.\n\nBut imagine if the first fucko to write a story about someone who can use \"magic\" was able to \"patent\" that, and suddenly no one else can ever write competing media about people using magic.\n\nEr, to be clear, copyright and patents are two distinctly different things. You can't patent a plotline about magic because the Patent Act only allows you to patent \"any process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter or improvement thereof\" under 35 USC section 101.\n\nThe reason you can't copyright a generic wizard is because you can't copyright ideas, concepts, systems, or methods - only your own expression of those ideas, concepts, systems, or methods. So everyone can write about wizards, but only I can write about my wizard.\n\nLikewise, if we can just flat out patent code or code concepts, the entire game industry dies because, whoops, you're stealing someone else's patent by making a guy who can jump from platform to platform.\n\nYou can't patent the concept of jumping puzzles because that in and of itself isn't \"a process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter or improvement thereof\". You'd only be able to patent the underlying code-based process. So if I patent the process of getting the number 4 by doing \"1+1+1+1=4\", you're allowed to get number 4 by doing \"2*2=4\".\n\nAlso, the game industry would not die since IP licensing is a thing, and it appears that you are not aware that it is a thing.\n\n\"I made a program that lets you send a message across the internet to someone else. An instant messenger, if you will. I patented that, no one else can do that now\". Yeah, great for innovation.\n\nIt is great for innovation! First, people who want to use it can license it from me, allowing me to recoup the costs of developing the invention. Further, now other people can take that patent disclosure, learn from it, and come up with improvements! \"Thanks to your patent, I realized that I can use your idea, combine it with Y, and come up with this great new innovation!\" I think a common misconception is that you can't improve on someone else's patent freely - this is not true. You can take someone's patent, improve it, and get what is known as an improvement patent (if you so wish to patent it).\n\nLest we forget that patents are public disclosure documents, that aforementioned improvement wouldn't have come about if the initial patent wasn't filed. This is because in order to obtain a patent, you must disclose a patent with enough detail that a person of ordinary skill in the art is able to practice that patent without undue experimentation. Realistically, in a world without patents, because most people like money, any inventions made would be kept secret, with only the bare minimum required to commercialize the invention being disclosed. How do inventors improve on something they can't actually understand?",

It would no longer be novel, and even if it is, it would fail the nonobviousness requirement.\n\nUS scientific and economic growth to the fact that the United States didn't have to rebuild post-WW2 whereas basically every other country had to.\n\nI'm not sure why you're bringing post-WW2 economics into this, because OC was referencing the beginnings of the US economy, since patents were written into the constitution at the founding of this country.\n\nThe US wouldn't have had the economic might to bring its industry to bear in WWI and WWII if it weren't for all the groundwork already laid down. If the US didn't have a patent system, why would anyone invent in America if they could just invent in a different country that did allow them to profit off their inventions?\n\nDoes OC think that people wouldn't invent and create things that make things more convenient for them or that passion projects driven by utility outside of financial incentives exist?\n\nWell, inventions are expensive to develop.

That \"string of quality control failures\" includes an incident where a pilot merely tried to take a turn 3x faster than allowed and an airline that didn't fix a pilot's seat for 7 years after being told to and then it failed in exactly the way they were warned it would.\n\nYou're saying this same stuff happens to airbuses or older boeings all the time and the press just choses not to report on it?\n\nNot all 10 things. But yes, most of them do. There was an Airbus that turned back for a similar failure as the United hydraulic failure on the same day. And the press didn't report it. Because honestly, it's not a real big deal in either case. The planes have redundancies for a reason and all planes have to make use of them. Both planes returned safely and landed.\n\nAdditionally most of the planes in this string ARE older Boeings!. The panel that broke off that plane going to Oregon?\n\nhttps://www.planespotters.net/airframe/boeing-737-800-n26226-united-airlines/ro75l3\n\nIt's not the MAX, which is only a few years old. It was the previous NG model, which is well proven to be safe, that series was made since the early 1990s. This plane was 15 years old. Admittedly that was still 3 years after Boeing spun out Spirit Aerosystems.\n\nWhat about the one that dropped a wheel a week before that? That plane is 29 years old.\n\nhttps://www.planespotters.net/airframe/boeing-777-200-n226ua-united-airlines/rz8yzr?refresh=1\n\nThat's a decade before Boeing spun out Spirit Aerosystems. And Spirit doesn't do that kind of work on 777s anyway, only 737s.\n\nBut also that isn't even what you asserted. You asserted that because this non-essential part broke it means there is something larger at play that means soon it won't be a non-essential part. There is no logic that or validity to that. It's just a useless slippery slope argument.",

While they are all unrelated, I want you to know that these incidents have our attention and have sharpened our focus.\n\nOur team is reviewing the details of each case to understand what happened and using those insights to inform our safety training and procedures across all employee groups. This is in addition to some changes that were already planned, including an extra day of in-person training for all pilots starting in May and a centralized training curriculum for our new-hire maintenance technicians. We're also dedicating more resources to supplier network management.\n\nWe empower our team to speak up and raise their hand if they see something wrong. You can be confident that every time a United plane pulls away from the gate, everyone on our team is working together to keep you safe on your trip.\n\nIn the past few years, we've done a lot at United to build a new culture, improve our business and earn your trust. I'm confident that we'll learn the right lessons from these recent incidents and continue to run an operation that puts safety first and makes our employees and customers proud.\n\nThank you for flying United, and I hope to see you onboard soon.\n\nSincerely, \n\nScott Kirby CEO United Airlines",

This isn’t just one airline, my friend.\n\nYet the 10 things referenced in the article are all one airline as said in, you know, the article itself. If you were to look at every single problem on every single aircraft for every single flight, it would number in the thousands across the world.\n\nThe news cycle right now is \"look, a problem on a Boeing, aren't they shit airplanes?\" for every single little thing. Regardless of how old the plane is, or the cause of the actual problem. It's just \"Boeing = bad = clicks and revenue\"! And all the armchair experts coming out of the woodwork to feed that is not only exhausting but damaging to fixing the actual problems.\n\nNobody is saying Boeing isn't having major problems, but the aerospace industry takes more than just \"I read some news articles\" to actually understand how it works. Planes are tremendously complex machines and therefore will have problems, fairly often actually. An engine problem detected on taxi is in no way shape or form proof positive that Boeing is a problem. And if you knew anything about airplanes engine problems are almost always not the fault of the end aircraft manufacturer.\n\nHell, there are plenty of problems that airplanes can still take off with and fly just fine with. Go look up MMEL documents.\n\nAnd for the record, as someone in the aerospace industry, the entire top levels of Boeing need to be removed and replaced and probably sent to jail for the cost cutting and profit above all culture of the company.",

He tried to take a 90 degree turn at 30 knots (34mph or so).\n\nWe know there wasn't a brake failure or anything because the pilot said so. He told the ground control that he wanted to travel very fast around the ground. He asked for permission and was given it, but it was assumed he would do it safely. He didn't.\n\nYou're working far to hard to make this a Boeing problem.",

The surgeons can bill more, it makes them feel cool and they just sit in the control booth and everyone else has to adjust/swap/position stuff so I think its just a good sales pitch that these companies got away with. It 20 yrs paired with AI maybe the robot does not need the surgeon and just a team of techs to set up and trouble shoot with a single surgeon’s on call if things go south, then the corporate overlords will really be patting themselves on the back.",

The 777's wing failed at 154%, which was even better than the engineers expected, so they were all really excited and proud of their work. There's a video of the test where you can hear their excitement.\n\nNo such video exists for the 787. Supposedly, the engineers were worried that if they exceeded the requirement by too much, then management would come back and say \"can you do it cheaper? We don't need that much of a safety margin.\"\n\nSource: a reddit comment from several years ago. So it may be compete BS.",

For different reasons than not meeting it.\n\nReaching 150% load isn't about just building it as strong as possible and shooting for as high a number as possible, with 150% being the minimum. It's about A; the physical test validating your math (meaning the results come in close to what you built it to withstand. And B; building it as strong as it needs to be without adding excess weight going needlessly overboard.\n\nIf you designed the wing to withstand 150% load, and it withstands 200% load. You've not only made your aircraft needlessly heavier, but it also means your math was flawed somewhere (meaning who knows where else it could have been flawed)\n\nIf the requirement is 150% load minimum, you're probably designing the wing for 155% load, with a +/- 5% margin for inevitable small manufacturing differences. If you fall below 150% that's obviously very bad as you fail, but if you significantly exceed it you SHOULD be looking at why, and if you can improve the final product by reducing that number closer to the 150%.\n\n154% is great because they passed obviously, but also because it means the math behind the design was very good, and the result closely matched the intention. And that is the ideal outcome of an engineering tests, when it not only passes, but passes with the result you expected.",

If they treated MCAS misfiring as a runaway trim problem then the corrective steps were the same.\n\nBut there was also some weird code that gave MCAS more authority that it should have had, and allowed it to keep activating after it was overridden.\n\nIf the software had more authority than intended (which I haven't heard of before) the maybe it's a software problem. However it could equally as likely be a requirements problem (which would be system design). However that does line up with the intent of MCAS, which was to just augment the flight characteristics, not completely override controls.\n\nThe repeated firing of the system would be intended if the plane kept encountering the situation where it was needed. So that wouldn't be a bug (but could be a \"fix\" to prevent the worst case scenario now that it was demonstrated to crash planes).\n\nApparently also, a bunch of the software was outsourced to developers in India.\n\nWould like a source on that, and on which software was be outsourced (as there's a lot of it on modern jets).",

Which is exactly what the pilots did on both occasions. And while this cut the MCAS system from making further changes to the trim of the aircraft, it makes it basically impossible for the pilots to manually change the trim to acceptable bounds, especially for the time of flight (right after takeoff).\n\nThis is NOT on the fault of the pilots.\n\nAs for the door plug, an entire step of the manufacturing process was missed, not applying the four master bolts to the door plug, which caused it to rip from the fuselage at altitude.\n\nAgain, NOT on the fault of the pilots.\n\nBoeing has now time and time again shown that gaining profits for shareholders and buying back their own stock to boost stock prices are their main priority, and the engineering culture of the company has completely vanished over the last 20 years.\n\nThe US needs Boeing to be the company it used to be. How they get back to that? I have no idea.",

The origins of Covid-19 comes to mind. Scientists involved in the research claimed \"An accusation that nCoV-2019 might have been engineered and released into the environment by humans (accidental or intentional) would need to be supported by strong data, beyond reasonable doubt.\"\n\nBut that is not the correct standard. No cause currently can reach that standard. Rather, the standard is \"preponderance of the evidence\".\n\nSo, lets look at the circumstantial evidence regarding accidental lab leak. We have the world's largest coronavirus lab that, as a usual and ordinary activity, created novel coronaviruses regularly. This lab contained a \"serial passage\" process that utilizes human tissues to amplify the contagiousness of viruses in humans. We have the coronavirus itself, which was novel and possessed an extreme contagiousness in humans.\n\nWe have dishonesty. The Chinese refused to release information on the experiments going on in that lab that would have implicated or exonerated their experiments as a cause, and we're permitted to draw an inference from that. We have an American researcher who spearheaded a paper claiming that any claim of lab leak was conspiracy theory, without disclosing that he was involved in creating novel coronaviruses at that Wuhan lab.\n\nWhat is the circumstantial evidence supporting natural emergence? I'll tell you what they have - Jack Shit. They have interesting ideas that constitute \"reasonable hypothesis\", but legally, reasonable hypothesis defeats a \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard. It doesn't defeat preponderance of the evidence. Preponderance is simply adding up the circumstantial evidence, and that tally indicates lab leak as most likely.\n\nThe government intervened to interfere with the discussion on the origins of C19 because, as the Supreme Court noted, \"an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will prevail\" would lead to some inconvenient truths, some of which I'll list here.\n\nAll of the deaths in the US would be negligent homicides or higher since the deaths were due to the hand of another.\n\nAll of us have been involuntarily made part of a medical experiment in violation of our human rights.\n\nThere has been the imposition of torture, ranging from mild discomfort to being placed on a ventilator, in violation of our human rights.\n\nThere has been the denial of informed consent in medical decisions, because the failure to mention that the virus was more likely than not man-made is a material omission.\n\n\nThis concern about \"disinformation\" is masking a concern with \"inconvenient truths\". Tally up the circumstantial evidence. I see it as clearly indicating lab leak, and natural emergence isn't close. This idea that the chances of natural emergence is equal to lab leak is itself, disinformation.",

It seems like Russian media gives the US too much credit and blames it for influencing everything that doesn’t agree with Russia. We mostly view Russia as a nonentity, a threat that used to be.\n\nThe far larger concern for the US and its allies is that Russia will become a puppet state for China. If China with its superior economic power controls Russia and its nuclear arsenal that could be very bad for Russia and the world.\n\nThe somewhat ironic part of it all, is that China got its economic power by partnering with the west so in hindsight maybe if Russia had done the same it wouldn’t be any less of a threat than China is today.

We agreed today that these countries will become members of NATO.\"\n\nIn the month before that, Biden's current CIA director, then a high-level diplomat, wrote to Condoleezza Rice, opposing George W. Bush's then-proposal of offering Ukraine and Georgia a path to membership into NATO, here is what he said,\n\n\"It will create fertile soil for Russian meddling in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. ... Ukrainian entry into NATO is the brightest of all redlines for the Russian elite (not just Putin). In more than two and a half years of conversations with key Russian players, from knuckle-draggers in the dark recesses of the Kremlin to Putin's sharpest liberal critics, I have yet to find anyone who views Ukraine in NATO as anything other than a direct challenge to Russian interests. ... Russia will respond.\"\n\nSubsequent to the Bucharest Declaration, Biden's current CIA director wrote this,\n\n\"In many ways, Bucharest left us with the worst of both worlds — indulging the Ukrainians and Georgians in hopes of NATO membership on which we were unlikely to deliver, while reinforcing Putin's sense that we were determined to pursue a course he saw as an existential threat.\"\n\nRussia invaded Georgia several months later, though for some reason Reuters did write a story headlined \"Georgia started war with Russia: EU-backed report\".\n\nRussia seized Crimea some years later, and subsequently launched a full scale completely unprovoked invasion into Ukraine more than a decade after the current CIA director wrote that offering Ukraine a path to membership in NATO would be the \"brightest of all redlines\" and \"create fertile soil for Russian meddling in Crimea and eastern Ukraine\".

Not bad things on a whole, but can make it harder to organize a union.\n\nCombine that with decades of good salaries, benefits, and job prospects, the necessity of a union wasn’t high.\n\nThen add in huge disparities in skill and abilities. The top IT person’s experience and skills will make them literally over 10x “better” at the job than a new person coming off a 3 month training boot camp. They don’t want to be stuck negotiating their salary and importance along with a Level 1 person. This exists in all industries, but it is way less prevalent in different jobs. The top 10% of Amazon Warehouse workers aren’t 10x better than the average worker there just isn’t room to be 10x better.\n\nThat’s gonna be an uphill battle to unionize and now that the industry has issues, it’s starting to be attractive to more but it’s kinda too late",

I asked my local labor board about this and they essentially said that it would be a lot harder to unionize as we aren't all under the same exact unbrella of employment. Some are direct company employees, others on w2 or 1099, and yet others are subcontracted, etc.\n\nBelieve me I absolutely tried in two IT environments. There's a lot of scummy red tape and decentralized team structures that I feel benefit the company more than the union organizer",

Some doctors are better than others, but they all need to have the same recognized qualifications, so hospitals can’t import hordes of foreign trained doctors on the basis that they can’t find enough professionals willing to work for $100k a year. Otherwise healthcare companies 100% would do it.\n\nThere was an effort to have a PE license for SE but the industry’s response was a big fuck you. It’s individualistic mentality through and through.\n\nIt works fine in the good times and it affords tech workers more freedom about how they get admitted to sit at the table. On the other hand, it forces the industry to have 6 interviews and LEET code tests since there’s no way to know who knows even just the basics (no one else does that, doctors don’t have to do a white board diagnosis to get hired …), and there’s no collective bargaining power.\n\nGratz it you’ve made it to the 1% and you’re a 10x’er making $500k a year. Everyone else can fuck off and figure it out on their own.\n\nIt’s the culture of the industry and it started a long time ago.",

(We have a few libertarians, but not many.) When I bring it up, the first thing people say is \"Well, I'd like to, but I worry I'd lose my job.\"\n\nPublishers are fickle. For every game that launches, there are probably 4-5 that get canned. Usually people don't even know about these games; they are cancelled before they even get announced.\n\nAt these larger publishers, you bet your bottom dollar that they would rather shut down a studio that unionizes rather than risk it spreading. QA staff at Keywords unionized and got laid off right away. When Raven Software QA unionized, Activision split them up and sent them all to separate teams to avoid them being able to remain in contact with one another.\n\nYour job is on the line, and hiring in the industry is tough right now. Even if firing you for unionizing is illegal - you have to prove it in court (which isn't a guarantee and costs money/time) and in the meantime you don't have a job (which means no money for rent/food).\n\nIt's a huge, very real risk, not just a hypothetical. It's very easy to say \"fight it in court\" when you're a bystander on the sidelines and not the person trying to figure out how to feed your kids. People simply don't want to rock the boat - especially since typically gamedev direct management is pretty down-to-earth/charismatic (with the folks who actually make the decision to fire folks isolated through a few layers of bureaucracy).\n\nGamedev is a small place. Everyone knows everyone. When someone is being hired, you can bet that the hiring manager will reach out to folks and investigate who they are. If you are known to be a loud-and-proud union organizer - that stuff spreads, and if HR finds out about it before you get hired that's going to impact whether you get a job or not.\n\nI would love to unionize my team. Trust me. But there's a lot of resistance, and it's going to take somewhere like Blizzard unionizing (and not just QA) before you start to see the tide shift.",

In almost every industry (especially in technology industries like IT/software development/etc) there are no more benefits to staying at a company longer than 2-4 years, like there were decades ago.\n\nRemember when companies would award staff that stayed there for like 40 years... with a GOLDEN WATCH? A literal watch made of gold, from a quality time-piece hand-manufacturer. It was reward for loyalty, and showed to others that it's worth staying around.\n\nThat practice hasn't happened for a long time, and honestly there's pretty good reason behind it.\n\nIt costs more to promote someone within a company, than to hire someone to fill a spot (new or existing). This is due to the cascading-cost-effect of promoting one person, leads to having to promote multiple people down the chain (which increases based on the first promotion's location in the org-chart). Each of those promotions have costs in terms of compensation adjustment, retraining, lost productivity while each person gets up to speed in the new role, and other stuff.\n\nIn-contrast, just hiring another person into the role typically costs less. Chances are they can reduce the compensation for the role vs the person that came in, or if they're an exceptional candidate, pay more for the new person, but that cost would likely be net-lower than if they promoted internally to fill.\n\nFrom the \"employee's\" perspective. Every time you move companies to a better paying job, more senior, or stuff like that, every 2-4 years, you will always be able to negotiate a compensation increase far greater than year-over-year \"raises\".\n\nMost companies have a hard time giving raises in the realm of 2-3% per year, especially if the person doing the job is acing it. In contrast, you can get a salary increase (typical, but not always) in the realm of 10%-30% (or more) depending on the role you're leaving, the role you're moving into, and what you bring to the table.\n\nIn only a handful of years I went from Linux SysAdmin at $62k/yr (which is grossly under market) to DevSecOps Manager (Head of IT Security in this case) at $132k/yr. And the majority of my existing experience was completely relevant to the new role, and I did take some other roles in between those two (each of them increasing my compensation along the way).",

This is due to the cascading-cost-effect of promoting one person, leads to having to promote multiple people down the chain (which increases based on the first promotion's location in the org-chart)\n\nMost companies have gone to an extremely flat structure for just this reason. It costs us much less to promote internally. Supplemental training for internal promotions, moving from another team, etc. is a small fraction the time taken to train a new person\n\nIn-contrast, just hiring another person into the role typically costs less. Chances are they can reduce the compensation for the role vs the person that came in, or if they're an exceptional candidate, pay more for the new person, but that cost would likely be net-lower than if they promoted internally to fill.\n\nThis is incredibly false and easily proven so. Low level employees it's a one time hit of almost 50% their annual salary to train a new employee.. if an employee is skilled that increases to double their annual, if they are highly skilled it's quadruple. That includes cost of the training and lost productivity as the new person ramps up. And that assumes your new hire is good, because oftentimes they aren't and you will incur that training fee twice",

But this is every company. It's just becomes a slope of perpetual decline.\n\n1st year, lose a 1/5 of your trained employees, and push their work onto existing employees. Second year keep thing like this while dealing with employee dropout. Third year, start feeling the effects of the staffing issues, 4th year start making cut around the workplace to bring back revenue.

Maybe, maybe not.\n\nIf someone makes a ransom note by clipping words or phrases from the newspaper, is the newspaper(the posters) responsible or the one who made the final sum piece(the social media site)? That's a more extremified example, but the argument is along similar lines.",

Prodigy Services Co. which held that websites could be held liable if they weren't a neutral party (i.e. they moderated/curated their content). Congress didn't want this, so they wrote Section 230 to allow websites to have their cake an eat it: to host and curate content, without being held liable for it.\n\nThe two authors of Section 230 also filed an amicus brief when a similar case went before the Supreme Court, they argued:\n\nSection 230 protects targeted recommendations to the same extent that it protects other forms of content presentation\n\nThat interpretation enables Section 230 to fulfill Congress’s purpose of encouraging innovation in content presentation and moderation. The real-time transmission of user-generated content that Section 230 fosters has become a backbone of online activity, relied upon by innumerable Internet users and platforms alike. Section 230’s protection remains as essential today as it was when the provision was enacted.\n\nthese companies are acting as publishers in contradiction to the spirit of the law and depend on the 90s era interpretation to avoid responsibility.\n\nIf they're publishers then Section 230 protects them, as Congress intended. You would need to argue that they're not publishers, because Congress intended to protect publishers and any publishing activity, even if Congress didn't know the particular and exist means that would happen through. It's not like the free speech clause doesn't apply just because the speech is happening in ways the framers didn't consider - the intent is to protect speech, just like Congress's intent was to protect curating content.",

Quantum computing is based on principles of quantum mechanics, which allow them to process a vast number of possibilities simultaneously through quantum superposition and entanglement.\n\nQuantum computers are expected to outperform classical computers significantly in tasks such as:\n\nFactorization: Breaking down large numbers into their prime factors (Shor's algorithm for quantum computers can do this exponentially faster than the best-known algorithms for classical computers).\n\nSearch Algorithms: Searching unsorted databases (Grover's algorithm offers a quadratic speedup over classical counterparts).\n\nSimulation of Quantum Systems: Incredibly valuable in chemistry and materials science, where classical computers struggle to simulate even relatively small quantum systems.\n\nHowever, for many everyday tasks like word processing, web browsing, or video playback, quantum computers offer no advantage and would be impractical due to their current requirements for extreme cooling and sensitive quantum state management.\n\nThe advantage of quantum computing becomes clear in highly complex problems where the ability to be in multiple states (superposition) and the entanglement of qubits can be used to compute certain problems much faster than classical computers. But for tasks that don't require such capabilities, classical computers will likely remain the tool of choice, especially considering their cost-effectiveness and ease of use.\n\nRelevant paper\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/369465303_Comparisons_of_Conventional_Computing_and_Quantum_Computing_Approaches",

From light cheap ones that Max out at something like 10 miles, to behemoths that are rated to go 70. Though the mile rating for escooters is usually based on flat track travel at 15 mph or so with a rider of 150 LBS or lower. So a big part of that is marketing BS but there are a growing number of people, especially those living in climates with warm winters, that are using scooters for day to day travel in cities.\n\nI own a scooter just above the mid size range that is rated for over 50 miles, I tend to get a bit over 35 miles per charge, but I don't run it to dead. I usually ride at around 20-30mph with both motors on and I'm over 200lbs.",

It’s roughly about the same as a copper cable being used to charge an EV which is really impressive because inductive charging usually has much higher losses. Over the long-term, I see these being embedded into parking spaces, so that rather than plugging a vehicle in, you would just park your car and come back to a fully charged vehicle. Literally nobody likes plugging their car in to the wall/charging unit and it’s much harder to steal it if it’s embedded in the concrete under the vehicle.\n\nYou inevitably get some losses from the inverter, on board charge control unit, and some other electrical hardware components but achieving parity with a physical charging cable has been elusive for a long time.",

Only if the charging stations are backed by batteries this could be remotely possible.\n\nFurthermore, I’d like to see the following scheme for EVs:\n\nIf the government gives you a grant to buy the EV, you effectively give them a 10%~15% of your capacity to the network. That way, we can use all the batteries of these vehicles that are almost always not moving to store/get energy up to 10%~15% from full charge (so, only deplete the battery at worst until it reaches 85%).",
