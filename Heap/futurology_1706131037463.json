This is what it proposed The novel centers around the dilemmas of an architect tasked with building a comfortable high-rise prison in Tokyo where law breakers are rehabilitated, and features AI as a theme.\n\nKudan said that, in her own life, she would consult ChatGPT about problems she felt she couldn’t tell anyone. “When the AI did not say what I expected,” she said, “I sometimes reflected my feelings in the lines of the main character.”\n\nThe author is not the first artist to generate controversy by using artificial intelligence, at a time where many creatives feel their livelihoods are threatened by the technology.\n\nLast year, Berlin-based photographer Boris Eldagsen withdrew from the Sony World Photography Awards after revealing his winning entry in the creative photo category was created using the technology.\n\nMeanwhile, authors like George R. R. Martin, Jodi Picoult and John Grisham joined a class action lawsuit against OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, last year, saying it used copyrighted work while training its systems to create more human-like responses.\n\nAnd more than 10,000 authors, including James Patterson, Roxane Gay and Margaret Atwood, signed an open letter calling on AI industry leaders to obtain consent from authors when using their work to train large language models — and to compensate them fairly when they do.\n\nThe best books of 2023, according to global tastemakers Writer and prize committee member Keiichiro Hirano took to X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter, to say the selection committee did not see Kudan’s use of AI as a problem.\n\n“It seems that the story that Rie Kudan’s award-winning work was written using generative AI is misunderstood… If you read it, you will see that the generative AI was mentioned in the work,” he wrote. “There will be problems with that kind of usage in the future, but that is not the case with ‘Tokyo Sympathy Tower.’”\n\nBut while some on social media expressed interest in Kudan’s creative use of AI and said they were now more interested in her work, others called it “disrespectful” to other authors who wrote without the help of the technology.\n\nPlease reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/19ep0cd/the_winner_of_a_prestigious_japanese_literary/kje2ak6/",

This is what it proposed The novel centers around the dilemmas of an architect tasked with building a comfortable high-rise prison in Tokyo where law breakers are rehabilitated, and features AI as a theme.\n\nKudan said that, in her own life, she would consult ChatGPT about problems she felt she couldn’t tell anyone. “When the AI did not say what I expected,” she said, “I sometimes reflected my feelings in the lines of the main character.”\n\nThe author is not the first artist to generate controversy by using artificial intelligence, at a time where many creatives feel their livelihoods are threatened by the technology.\n\nLast year, Berlin-based photographer Boris Eldagsen withdrew from the Sony World Photography Awards after revealing his winning entry in the creative photo category was created using the technology.\n\nMeanwhile, authors like George R. R. Martin, Jodi Picoult and John Grisham joined a class action lawsuit against OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, last year, saying it used copyrighted work while training its systems to create more human-like responses.\n\nAnd more than 10,000 authors, including James Patterson, Roxane Gay and Margaret Atwood, signed an open letter calling on AI industry leaders to obtain consent from authors when using their work to train large language models — and to compensate them fairly when they do.\n\nThe best books of 2023, according to global tastemakers Writer and prize committee member Keiichiro Hirano took to X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter, to say the selection committee did not see Kudan’s use of AI as a problem.\n\n“It seems that the story that Rie Kudan’s award-winning work was written using generative AI is misunderstood… If you read it, you will see that the generative AI was mentioned in the work,” he wrote. “There will be problems with that kind of usage in the future, but that is not the case with ‘Tokyo Sympathy Tower.’”\n\nBut while some on social media expressed interest in Kudan’s creative use of AI and said they were now more interested in her work, others called it “disrespectful” to other authors who wrote without the help of the technology.",

They had 1000s of these stories taught by ear.     The researchers were walking along, singing their little hearts out, when they were suddenly standing on the edge of the sea. Did they take a wrong turn? They talked to a geologist who asked \"What's out in the sea?\" \"Water\" they replied. \"No, what's under the water?\"     When they looked at oceanic charts, there was the rest of the story. \"How long ago would the sea level have been that low?\" they asked. \"The Pleistocene ice-age, 10,500 years ago.\"     The researchers realized the story they were signing was at least 500 generations old. Sung down the generations longer than the pyramids of ancient Egypt have stood. A geographically accurate song that had never been written down--just humans helping humans.",

What happens when Meta's headsets can capture and render coffee mugs? What happens when the avatars are photorealistic and not awkward? What happens when everything is small, compact, and comfortable?\n\nThis article is confused on what the metaverse is in the first place.

You don’t have to switch gears and learn whole thing. You see instant results in real time and tweak on the fly. I already do it to a certain extent. The one drawback is not being able to see your keyboard. But pass through keyholes in quest three can solve that. It’s still stupid intense, GPU wise.

There are some binocular ones that have gotten surprisingly small such as digilens but after trying them it felt like we still have until the late 2020s before we can indulge in the sort of early iPhone equivalent of consumer AR glasses even remotely worth using.\n\nNow I don’t see like things like affordable global persistan spatial anchors, affordable real time silhouette detection, flawless hand tracking happening super soon but I will say I recently got my hands on hand tracking software that is physics based that is good enough for multi finger typing and sign language but solid hand tracking will be needed too going forward",

I ignored your warning about mobile and did it on my phone, and yeah in hindsight I'm worried I muddied the results because I was viewing images at such a small resolution I almost certainly wouldn't be able to to see telltale AI signs or discrepancies. \n\nWas an interesting study! I had some complaints about methodology but they were all addressed by the breakdown at the end. I do worry about their ability to gain useful data when their images don't really factor personal sexuality into the equation (I'm pansexual so it's whatever, but I imagine a straight man might flag all the nude male images as low-sexy for reasons having nothing to do with AI vs Photograph).\n\nI also found it weird their two demographics questions were \"what is your biological sex\" and \"what is your sexuality\", as together those don't actually allow you to infer anyone's attraction level to male and female bodies (as there's no way to know whether a correspondent is trans and therefore attracted to the opposite images the survey would expect).",

With state funded, that's probably going to mean specifically living in housing owned by the state, and probably only being able to get state specified food items.\n\nBoth options are better than the \"if you're broke, live on the streets and die\" attitude we currently have.",

My country tried similar stuff and we're not magically wealthier or some shit. Government started to give out money for all parents of children below 18 to encourage people to start families and now nurseries and preschools are expensive enough to not feel the difference (+people with children are dependent on the government money now). Government lowered interest rates on loans under some conditions and housing is getting more and more expensive because it all goes to the developers.\n\nUBI is just the same. Without regulations, it's the wild west for landlords and other parasites. No one stops them from raising rents by the amount of UBI. It doesn't happen overnight, but it comes to this.

Giving more money to poor people to spend on rent will indeed drive up rent costs. But those increased landlord profits will in turn provide greater incentives for land owners and builders to create more housing units. Land that is currently being used for crappy strip malls (because that’s the highest use) will instead be converted to apartments to cash in on the rent bonanza. The end result is more housing, and more people with cash in their pocket to pay for the housing.\n\nI feel like people always miss this dynamic. We want prices for the stuff poor people use to go up—so long as we also give them money to pay those higher prices—because that stimulates the economy to produce more of the stuff that poor people use, which benefits them in the long run.",

Keep the supply of people who can pay a high rent low.\n\nIf we implement UBI with the intention of guaranteeing housing, then there's no reason not to regulate rents to conform with that goal. Fundamentally, we shouldn't have a purely free market for housing because we want to ensure housing as a right, and those two things are incompatible, much as with utilities.

What happened around that time? China became a member of the WTO (in December 2001). Then it was off to the races.\n\nSo no serious observers have been calling for China's economic collapse for \"decades\". China has only been an economic force for two decades, with the first decade of economic growth playing a large role in boosting the global economy.\n\nSo what's changed? Why the doom and gloom now?\n\nChina has peaked demographically (and earlier than previously predicted) due to the stupidity of the government (One Child). The population could as much as halve by 2100, with two-thirds of the working age population disappearing. The ramifications for the Chinese economy are massive.\nIt hasn't been talked about much because it has been hiding in plain sight but China is actually a kleptocracy and now the costs of years of corruption and graft are becoming visible.\nRelated to the above, China went on a massive debt binge and a significant amount of the capital raised went to malinvestment. Making matters worse is the fact that a lot of the debt has been intentionally hidden, making it hard for anyone to measure it.\nChina's new Mao has prioritized maintaining power and control over the health of the economy, which has produced economic policies that have gravely hurt Chinese businesses and consumers in the wake of COVID.",

When the system has no checks and balances, someone always comes along to seize power for its own sake.\n\nIt’s trite and corny, but it’s true: Democracy—messy, frustrating and inefficient—is the worst form of government, except for all the others.",

They have been instrumental in China’s rapid economic growth and are more capitalist in nature compared to other parts of the country.\n\nOther countries have similar zones.",

It's a city that runs on its own and because it's an important port, the CCP gives it leaniency for certain things like churches(which is a big no no everywhere else). It's still all capitalism.\n\nTheir socialism part stands on providing more services to people who need it, for example Xi Jingping is unpopular with capitalists because he takes money from the large cities (shanghai) and moves the resources to develop rural areas and small towns. You also won't see homeless people in large cities because they're often given a ticket back to their hometown with resources provided that they stay there to build up. All these things started happening more under Xi which is why capitalist Chinese have started hiding their money elsewhere.\n\nTheir federal government (CCP) sets all the standards because local government is known to do some sketchy things (ie. the sewer oil)\n\nChinese people love nothing more than starting businesses, I doubt that's possible in communism.\n\nGo visit China. I bet it's nothing like you can imagine.",

Most people who don't speak Chinese have this difficulty.\n\nEvery government can have a label sticked to it, like communism or libertarian or socialist. The label doesn't matter as much as what the government actually does.\n\nPractically speaking, China has a very good social safety net where every citizen is monitored and accounted for. Being homeless is not a freedom one can choose for themselves. The best comparison, at a massive super simplification, is the US government treats its people like adults, more political freedom, more self responsibility, very little care. In China, the citizens have close to no political freedom, but more care and support to ensure equal economic and education opportunities.\n\nIt's a trade-off to your day to day citizens.",

We live in it.\n\nWhen feudalism were the norm, people never thought about capitalism or how could a capitalist society work, it took centuries for capitalism to settle as the norm and there is still remnants of feudalism in capitalism. Every system that came was born from the previous.\n\nSo how can you say how to build a society that never existed? You don't, you just go along using theories that can guide you to that goal ,in this case it's Marxism-Leninism.\n\nWhen the right conditions happened capitalism could grow and became what we know today. But capitalism never existed in the all planet at the same time, it's actually a young system compared to the previous.\n\nSo Chinese people know that. They study those theories in school. They believe they are creating every day a society closer to that and they understand today's limitations and why the goal is unnatainable with our present structure. But if the conditions change to a one who can enable communism then it will come to existence.\n\nTLDR: It's hard to tell something is stale if you have few or no things to compare to. But the changes for the better on China's society is measurable and it is what their theory \"preaches\".",

                "comment": "No, socialist countries don't do that. If you don't work you don't eat, unless you have reasons to not to.\n\nDevil's advocate, but the whole reason socialist countries don't provide such is because socialism essentially is a 22nd century ideology sent back to the 19th century and implemented in the 20th. I just don't see how socialism can work economically without extensive automation.\n\nAnd lo and behold, neither did Karl Marx himself. From Das Kapital:\n\nIf, then, the capitalistic employment of machinery, on the one hand, supplies new and powerful motives to an excessive lengthening of the working day, and radically changes, as well the methods of labour, as also the character of the social working organism, in such a manner as to break down all opposition to this tendency, on the other hand, it produces, partly by opening out to the capitalist new strata of the working class, previously inaccessible to him, partly by setting free the labourers it supplants, a surplus working population, which is compelled to submit to the dictation of capital. Hence that remarkable phenomenon in the history of modern industry, that machinery sweeps away every moral and natural restriction on the length of the working day. Hence, too, the economic paradox, that the most powerful instrument for shortening labour time, becomes the most unfailing means for placing every moment of the labourer's time and that of his family, at the disposal of the capitalist for the purpose of expanding the value of his capital. “If,\" dreamed Aristotle, the greatest thinker of antiquity, \"if every tool, when summoned, or even of its own accord, could do the work that befits it, just as the creations of Daedalus moved of themselves, or the tripods of Hephaestos went of their own accord to their sacred work, if the weavers' shuttles were to weave of themselves, then there would be no need either of apprentices for the master workers, or of slaves for the lords.” And Antipatros, a Greek poet of the time of Cicero, hailed the invention of the water-wheel for grinding corn, an invention that is the elementary form of all machinery, as the giver of freedom to female slaves, and the bringer back of the golden age. Oh! those heathens! They understood, as the learned Bastiat, and before him the still wiser MacCulloch have discovered, nothing of Political Economy and Christianity. They did not, for example, comprehend that machinery is the surest means of lengthening the working day. They perhaps excused the slavery of one on the ground that it was a means to the full development of another. But to preach slavery of the masses, in order that a few crude and half-educated parvenus, might become \"eminent spinners\", \"extensive sausage-makers\", and \"influential shoe-black dealers\", to do this, they lacked the bump of Christianity.\n\nJust about every time socialism was implemented in the 20th century was in countries Marx would have described as least ready for socialism: rural, agrarian, bombed out, or at best lower-end industrialization. Because of course Angola, Cuba, Cambodia, and Laos were bastions of high-tech heavily mechanized post-industrial economies.\n\nThe closest to being ready was probably either East Germany or Venezuela, and it didn't work out even then. You can argue that the USA was responsible for undermining them, which is true, we don't even deny we do, but I strongly feel that it still wouldn't work even without the CIA's meddling just because you need high-automation— advanced robotics, AI, and whatnot— to provide that level of labor that Marx said would cause capitalism's contradictions to cause an implosion.\n\nHell, that was the contradiction Marx was talking about: capitalism begets rapid industrial innovation which leads to greater mechanization and automation, but automation replaces labor which reduces profits which leads to capitalist economies growing deeply unstable and ultimately being replaced by socialist ones that better allocate the resources of an automated economy. In that situation, it would be less \"proletarian vanguard forcing the Dictatorship of the Proletariat upon a country and creating a dysfunctional centrally planned economy that leads to breadlines and gulags\" and more \"the modern version of the shift from feudalism & mercantilism to capitalism.\"\n\nMarx's failing was thinking that 1840s-era mechanization was enough to allow for and sustain socialism. I personally don't think socialism is going to be possible to function correctly until artificial general intelligence is created.\n\nWhen robots aren't there, then of course humans have to work. But that in itself just leads to internal contradictions within socialism.",

Nothing would automate if this was true. Profits increase once automation is implemented which why everything is being automated. Automation allows for more competition though which is very beneficial to the consumer because it drives down prices while pushing up wages.\n\nreplaced by socialist ones that better allocate the resources of an automated economy\n\nThe good part about capitalism is that it that it does exactly what you're saying socialists do. The historical records shows socialist countries are exactly what you described capitalist countries as. The entire point of capitalism is to maximize profit which necessitates the most efficient resource allocation. Socialist countries have been notoriously bad at maximizing efficiency and was a major reason for the Chinese to open up and become more capitalist.\n\nYou're also misunderstanding the nature of profit and assuming a government monopoly wouldn't act any differently from a private monopoly. Monopolies will never charge an equilibrium price since they set prices and demand is inelastic. In perfect competition economies, businesses have no control over prices, demand is elastic and set by supply and demand in the economy. In such an economy, profit is exists purely as a measurement showing where there is a deficit in production.",

Preferably flexible, protein-rich, easy-to-grow, easy to digest and above all, tasty, food. Something everyone likes. Something like hummus.\n\nIn a new preliminary paper, a team of scientists have found a way to coax chickpeas to grow in a simulated lunar soil mixture, demonstrating for the first time that this super crop could help sustain future astronauts on the moon.\n\nThe key to settling on the moon and eventually Mars will be to become as self-sustaining as possible. Future astronauts won't be able to rely on regular food deliveries from Earth; they will need to grow their own. That's part of the reason why astronauts on the International Space Station have spent years cultivating lettuce and tomatoes in microgravity to help supplement their diets.\n\nBut growing stuff on the moon is even harder.

If not enough people are being born the liberal approach is to relax immigration requirements while the conservative one is to outlaw abortion and tax contraceptives and other forms of birth control.\n\nThe problem with the liberal response is, you bring in immigrants to work non union, minimum wage jobs but where are they going to live if even a bachelor suite costs more than they make each month? The result is you'll have 2-4 people living in a studio apartment(assuming a landlord will even rent to a family or squad of men/women looking to rent a unit designed for a single person). And the foreign workers with degrees are starting to leave too because their buying power isn't what they were lead to believe it was. https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadas-surging-cost-living-fuels-reverse-immigration-2023-12-09/\n\nPeople are seeing the value of their labor diminish in real time and they're responding by unionizing, striking, trying for another job or just straight up leaving. The assumption that foreign born workers will put up with abuse is being challenged by the fact that they have access to social media and can learn directly from people in similar situations. It's not hard for an Asian or Latin worker to create a reddit account or type in \"workers rights[country]\" into a search engine.  This also doesn't account for the level of bigotry in the local population that can hurt the reputation of the country as a place to move to or the clash of values if the new arrivals don't agree with the social rules of the country.\n\nThe conservative response is of course to curtail freedoms and people won't like that either and just resort to things like refusing to even get into relationships or have sex. Something that is already happening anyway. https://ifstudies.org/blog/theres-no-huge-gender-gap-in-being-single-among-young-adults\n\nThe rates of single and unmarried people continues to grow. So if you're out here as a single man or woman, working a job that is unsafe or low paying, there's nothing forcing you to stay. I personally can identify with the feeling of knowing that I can get up and leave because I'm not tied to an asset(mortgage) and don't have dependent children or a partner who may want to stay in their job or who is dependent on my income. And if I'm also a worker who is good at what he does, it creates even more of a challenge for the employer. They'll lose money by having to retrain another applicant who may not even stick around as long after getting the job and seeing what it's like.\n\nAgain the role social media plays is that it debunks corporate talking points and half truths. People right now are making videos and posting comments about what it's actually like to work at _______ industry or with _______ employer. They don't really have any response to that since the legacy news outlets they own are being contradicted by independent news sources or actual employees on the ground telling their own story on social media.",

People may be becoming less worried about stability, the future, owning a home, and other things that are becoming out of reach anyway in America. With so few replacement workers in the queue and a YOLO attitude, perhaps people will fight their bosses harder. If they do, and the OG poster's premise is true, corporate America brought this on itself with its greedy, selfish overreach and promotion of the almighty dollar.\n\nWhatever the causes and effects really are, declining birthrates are here to stay. America values only money. Things that cannot be monetized have no value. How do you monetize a child? Their value is clearly infinite in that the rest of us cannot care for ourselves in old age without them, and the species goes extinct without them, but you will find almost no help from America to raise a child here. It is an enormous financial burden for the individuals that do. I know. I raised two wonderful children who are now productive adults, but it was not easy. We scrimped, saved, and sacrificed the whole way and are now in a much worse financial position than we would have been without kids. I could have easily retired years ago if I had not made a choice to have a family. This is my punishment in America for doing something for the common good instead of for myself.

If there are 9 old people and one young person, the 9 people are going to be in a bidding war because that one young person can only do so much work in a day.\n\nThe concern about declining birthrates isn't about total population counts, it's about the fact that the average age is going up significantly as a result. If the average age of a country is something like 65... you have a big problem.\n\nhttps://www.worldometers.info/demographics/world-demographics/#:~:text=The%20median%20age%20in%20the%20World%20is%2030.5%20years%20(2023)).\n\nIn 1974, the average age was around 20, now it's over 30. That's the \"never experienced before in history\" situation. And keep in mind, that's the global average which is dragged down by places in central Africa for example where the average age is 15. Japan is coming up on an average age of 50, most of Europe/Canada is around 40, and the US is coming up on it with an average around 37.\n\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/age-structure\n\nSo make no mistake. We are absolutely in a \"never experienced before in history\" situation. That part isn't up for debate, the only question is \"what does that mean?\"",

Women joining the workforce to the extent that they participate in modern times should have cause the same situation you currently suggest. Yet instead it's now gotten to the point where having one parent stay at home is considered the exception rather than the norm.\n\nReality is that whatever the new normal becomes in terms of income and children, wages, prices, and expectations will rise to maintain the status quo.\n\nThe most likely outcome from your scenario is that raising kids gets more expensive for parents as a ton of people say \"I'm not having kids, why should my taxes go towards someone else's kids\"\n\nMy town just went through a vote to approve full day kindergarten. I think the average tax bill per quarter went up something like 3%(e.g. up to $12,400 vs $12,000) for most residents, and you wouldn't believe the outrage from those who don't have kids. With declining birthrates, that viewpoint is likely to grow.\n\nNo-kid individuals aren't going to \"win\" it's parents who are going to \"lose\" in order to keep the balance. The same way dual income families didn't \"win\" by having women join the workforce, things just adjusted so that single income families \"lost\"\n\nNote: I'm not saying women joining the workforce is a bad thing or getting into the complexities of male/female power balance by having one gender work. I'm only using that point as a recent example where the average family suddenly had a sudden significant shift in financial status.",

Porsche might use far higher performance batteries for weight & space reasons while a pickup or minivan might use bigger heavier cheaper batteries.\n\nSwapping out a huge heavy high-voltage high-power thing across hundreds of different shapes & sizes of car is not easy to automate and risks problems like damaged connectors or attachment hardware. Battery packs don't just have a big + and - terminal like an AA battery, they have entire battery monitoring systems to connect into the vehicle's system as well as complicated liquid cooling which would need expensive dry-break connectors and be a source of leaks or other problems after lots of swaps.\n\nPlus the swap station needs a stock of battery packs - given that the battery pack can be 30-50% of the cost of a car you're asking every swap station to have potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars of battery packs just sitting around on charge.",

A new unused battery is much better than a battery with a few hundred charge cycles, better still than one with a few thousand cycles etc.\n\nFor this to work you’d need a couple things: 1. A rapid and cheap test to comprehensively assess the state of the battery (this is actually quite hard, you can do the test but not quickly) 2. A generally agreed adjustment pricing mechanism - a variable fee or rebate paid or received by the driver based on the difference between the two batteries. This fee could easily run into the thousands if someone turns up with an old and very used battery, and the swapping station doesn’t have anything of a similar age there.",

The battery sleds are massive and expensive. They'd go through hundreds of batteries a day. If the batteries take a while to charge they'll need dozens of chargers. If the batteries charge quickly why bother taking them out of vehicles? Winter means batteries will go dead faster and need trickle chargers.\n\nEvery gas station would have to become a Costco just to store the batteries they cycle.",

So even if you match the overall speed of a gas refill for an individual car, your throughput on the same amount of land will be reduced versus an equivalent gas station. And you have to develop a whole new logistics system to deal with the batteries - it probably makes sense to charge them on-site rather than ship them back and forth from centralized charging hubs, but if you're going to be installing high-power charging anyway... then you've basically made yourself an EV charging station already without the extra cost of having to build a complex and large auto-swap station as well. (Plus there's the fact that if a charge takes ~15/20 minutes each time you increase your retail revenues from people taking the break to buy food/drink/other goods - lots of retailers and service station companies are perfectly happy with customers being forced to hang around for a few minutes longer each time they visit).\n\nIt's a nice idea in practice but it just seems like something that would only have a niche application as the existing EV charging station setup is less expensive and complex (like in the video, where the company is pitched to a higher-wealth market willing to pay for the extra convenience).\n\nWhere it will probably come in is in commercial and industrial sector applications though - think trucks picking up from mines, ambulances, buses, military vehicles, etc. Sectors with large fleets of vehicles of limited variety, and where there's a priority on being able to limit downtime between stops.\n\nThere's also maybe some potential in the car rental sector, where companies like Hertz are unhappy that their shiny new EV fleets are generating less revenue due to taking too long to reach full charge between bookings. But their customers have to be able to also charge out on the road, which again presents the same problems as before.",

Infrastructure is probably the biggest advantage of BEVs over hydrogen power, but even that might be overstated.\n\nLithium Ion batteries are so far off from matching diesel/petrol in specific energy (energy per unit mass) that incremental improvements to current tech have no hope of closing the gap. And the specific energy of hydrogen fuel is triple that of diesel/petrol.\n\nCurrent Li-ion batteries: 0.97 MJ/kg (270 watt-hours/kg)\nCutting Edge Lithium: 2.5 MJ/kg (created by researchers in a lab in 2023, not production ready)\nDiesel/Petrol: 45 MJ/kg (18x the energy density of cutting edge, 45x current tech)\nHydrogen: 120 MJ/kg (48x cutting edge, 120x current tech)\n\nCurrent density represents an increase of roughly 0.6 MJ/kg over 10 years ago (density has tripled). If we assume it continues to triple every 1 years, then it would take until the late 2050s to match diesel/petrol. This is not realistic, however, as the theoretical maximum of Li-S batteries at 400v (Tesla battery voltage) is 2.412 MJ/kg. I couldn’t find what voltage was used for the “cutting edge” battery, but if we triple the battery voltage to 1200v that simply triples density to 7.2 MJ/kg. By contrast, hydrogen has the highest theoretical specific energy of any practical fuel at 142 MJ/kg.\n\nLi-ion developments over the last decade have alleviated the practical issues for personal transport in developed countries. For personal vehicles, more mass isn’t much of an issue. A Tesla Model X weighs roughly 50% more (800kg) than an ICE SUV with comparable passenger volume (2,330 kg vs 1,590 for a RAV4). This is not viable for many industrial applications like trucks where the energy and range requirements are vastly different. The absolute maximum gross vehicle weight in the US is 80,000 lbs (26.2 metric tons) and 40 metric tons in Europe. To match the range of a diesel semi (1,600 - 3,200 km) would require using up nearly all the available gross weight just for batteries. Hydrogen power would actually increase the range of a semi relative to ICE tech.\n\nBattery tech isn’t close to resolving issues for use in the developing world either, which contains a majority of the world’s population. The electric grid in many of these places struggles to power the basics, let alone millions of BEV chargers. A hydrogen car could theoretically drive nearly 20x the range of the best-case theoretical max for a BEV (or 120x current tech, 50x cutting edge), an especially attractive proposition here. For refueling infrastructure, you don’t need to be able to refuel/recharge at home or in essentially any municipality like with BEV or ICE vehicles if you only need to refuel once every year or two.\n\nAs for volatility, Li-ion has its own well-documented issues with battery fires that will likely increase as energy density increases, so I’m not sure BEVs have much of an advantage here.\n\nSome smaller advantages: * Refueling speed - it only takes a few minutes to refuel a hydrogen cell * Negative emissions - the hydrogen-to-electricity converter in a car filters out pollutants like sulfur dioxide\n\nEdit: Formatting",

Because you will not own the battery, the car will be cheaper\nb. Toyota will not lose the precious metals and components.\nTheir idea may actually gain traction over time.\nWith regards to hydrogen, while scientifically speaking it is less efficient than EVs, it is by far more practical, especially if the supporting infrastructure is subsidised. It is easy to fill up as car, i.e. same as current petrol, it does not freeze up or fail in cold weather as we have seen in Edmonton recently with Tesla EVs, there is no mile anxiety as long as the infrastructure exists and you can tax it in the same manner as petrol, per liter.",

A huge selling point of EVs is that for day-to-day use, you never have to stop at charging stations since you just plug it in at home each night. It doesn't matter that hydrogen is \"as easy to fill up as a car\" because with an EV you can completely eliminate the chore of \"stopping for gas.\"\n\nAnd yes, for longer-range trips EVs still need charging stations which aren't as quick as gas or hydrogen fillups. But this clearly hasn't been a roadblock for their adoption, and is only going to improve over time.\n\nThe cold weather problem is a hurdle for EVs, but not insurmountable.

Far easier to augment existing gas stations with hydrogen than it would be to roll out millions of EV chargers.\n\nBut regarding the \"huge\" selling point of at-home charging, I don't think this minor benefit really outweighs the massive downside of having long multi-hour charging sessions when on a longer trip. One horrible experience where you miss an important event due to long charge times, would outweigh 1000 small trips to the pump. At best this \"feature\" seems like a wash for me, until charging times are drastically reduced.\n\nYou can't really say what is a barrier to adoption when EVs account for only 9% of sales, 91% are not adopting today.",

You know all those warning about sparks, smoking, using cellphones, and static electricity we all currently ignore at the gas pump? Get ready to get real serious about them if you don't want a massive disaster on your hands.\n\nAlso, hydrogen isn't going to take off because it's a net loss in energy consumption. It takes 3x the energy to break hydrogen and oxygen apart than is created during combustion/recombining them. That's what's going to kill hydrogen. And has in most places that have done the research and the math.\n\nAs a side note, weirdly, gasoline is a more efficient way of using hydrogen as a power source. There's waaaay more hydrogen atoms in a molecule of gasoline than there is in pure compressed/liquid hydrogen. And it's stable at room temperature, relatively non-volatile in common situations, and a LOT easier to store. It has other drawbacks though which is why we're currently moving away from it.",

Hybrid does make a lot more sense since they can be fully electric in warmer weather, and then gas when batteries can't keep up with demand. Multiple energy sources are more reliable and would lead to greater buy in.\n\nEdit - lots of great responses below, thanks, and didn't mean to offend my neighbors north of the white wall haha\n\nI'm in NY, and last week we had a cold spell. Friend rented a Tesla, and though it was charged they got significantly worse mileage, wound up getting stuck and needing a tow truck. I think there is a temperature effect on efficiency - and like anything when transportation is mission critical, having multiple fuel sources is probably a good thing. Why I see hybrids as a good stop gap for the next 10-20 years as those other issues are solved, whether through casing materials (buttwipe843), solid state (YamahaRyoko), or other. Extreme temperatures are an engineering problem, whether too hot (tires melting) or too cold (oil freezing in the pan), that's solvable with enough resources.\n\nThis was a good comment that expanded what my point was, in that home charging is a mission critical issue that isn't widely available:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/19e7v3q/comment/kjcde2s/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3",

If they have just 1kw of solar and a small battery storage it allows them to charge up things like tools, ebikes, and perhaps even a small refrigerator. All those would drastically increase their standard of living and give them the ability to increase their income.\n\nSmall village solar, even if just used for charging batteries would be a game changer.",

EVs are so much more convenient than fuel powered cars other than on road trips but that’s getting better day by day.

Where I live we are still waiting for plants announced in 2008 - 2010 to be finished, and in the meantime advancing renewables have crashed the price of electric far below the then market rates, and these plants have been guaranteed unit prices well above even that. When they do come online these plants will look like white elephants and further discourage any new construction.\n\nAny new project announced today probably won't come online until about 2040. By that time its difficult to see how they can possibly compete with the by then current generation and storage grid.\n\nWhere does the political will to build more fission come from after that?

China has tons under construction, even if renewable energy grew faster, along with India. France is doubling down on it, Egypt and Turkey are starting. I think we'll see a transition from the west to the east in terms of nuclear energy, and we may see more reactors shut down than built for a short time. Because a lot of reactors in the west built in the 70s are retiring now, but when they're over that hump, it'll be growing again worldwide. Some countries have much more restrictions and hoops to jump through than others. Of course nuclear reactors should have a lot of hoops to jump through, but some countries like the US are just overkill. They put in much stricter regulations than most of Europe even after the Three Mile Island disaster (the disaster being people immediately nearby got the radiation equivalent of a chest x-ray) and this killed the financial viability of any new projects.",

Since then, the technology has been stuck in an awkward local maxima while we continued to dump carbon into the atmosphere.\n\nFossil fuel plants are cheap to build but expensive to run because of fuel requirements.\n\nRenewables are expensive to build but cheap to run because there aren't any fuel requirements.\n\nIf we lick nuclear, either fission or fusion, we'll have cheap plants with almost but not quite zero fuel requirements.

If some \"heavy central planning, low regulation, low NIMBY power\" environment could save nuclear, it would be winning in China over renewables.

Meanwhile though, as volume scales up, those raw materials are not going to meet demand (there would have needed to be a decade long lead-up of investment in mining which didn't happen), and that's going to drive prices up a lot. Even if price fixing is applied, the material volume isn't going to be there.\n\nOn top of this, these renewables, aren't actually renewable themselves. The cheap manufacturing processes don't allow for overheads like making them suitable for recycling. As the renewables market increases, and some of the older installations reach end of life, we're going to see tremendous piles of un-recyclable junk.",

The overall supply of solar panels in the late 90s was not enough to create a viable recycling business.

Men have a bit of a history with being douchebags (I've witnessed that on a friend's tinder) in apps and looking for excuses to show their dicks, making women even more selective.\n\nAll of a sudden everyone has extremely high expectations, men have to step on eggs, women find mostly handsome douchebags and very few people actually get together.\n\nAnd men are particularly desperate, so they need to pay for competitive advantages to even have a chance.",

They know the likelihood of matches for men are low, so they use the initial rush to sell you “boosts” that boost your chances at quite high prices with a subset of users being power users spending hundreds on this.

People had \"third places\" to go to and laugh and interact with others. People spent time doing things outside of the realm of commerce, like putting on a play for the town, or collecting pretty flowers to decorate for a holiday. Life was less transactional. You knew your neighbors. You could probably work around where you grew up and you'd be able to support a family.\n\nUnder the late stage capitalist society we live in, most young men do something they have no connection to - some bullshit cubicle work or brain rotting activity. Then they zoom home to bullshit on Discord or Reddit or play video games until they start over again the next day. Maybe they moved away from any family or support structure they had for their job, so they don't have anybody. All their potential peers are hustling, selling bullshit crypto or answering work emails till 11, or working the second job at night. Every time you meet someone, you feel like you need to justify your time around them that's taking away from their \"making money\" time or \"playing video games alone to recuperate\" time. The idea of a community is laughable in these conditions.\n\nThese men are unlikely to do something out of their comfort zone, like learn to dance, volunteer, paint by the water, or do something where they can cultivate neighbors. There's an internal shame because they know their salary can't support a house and family like their grandfather's could.\n\nOf course these men are going to be lonely. It has everything to do with our socioeconomic reality and every man for himself culture, and little if anything to do with the fact that Tinder came out in 2013.",

If i could change this app i would put a limit to men when they have to swipe right to women and they could swipe right only to 20 percent of the profiles, and of course women who are in this app only to advertise their social media it would be forbidden.

When it's a massive, billion dollar industry that's only growing... more successful. Which is the opposite of failing.\n\nMen are lonely because they're so highly inexperienced with normal social interactions, especially with women! They sit at home playing video games and watching porn.\n\nHate to break it to you—but most (not all) girls don't give a shit about playing video games and fapping to porn, and they certainly don't want to have a conversation about that.\n\nHaving mutual interests is a good starting point but those interests obviously need to be in an environment where you're actually able to meet new people. This means IN PUBLIC.\n\nThe dudes that are so lonely are the ones that won't get out of their comfort zones and actually try. Swiping on Tinder is NOT trying.",

                "comment": "Well, I used Tinder once and matched with a redhead girl who was very good looking and thick in all the right places.\n\nWhen I met her, I wasn't attracted at all, even though she looked just like her pictures. The problem was that she moved in a decrepit way, the opposite of how a girl who is an athlete or dancer moves and it's a huge turnoff for me.\n\nThat was when I realized online dating was not for me because I could have chatted with her online for a month or two and meeting her would have been just as much of a turn off.\n\nI like confident girls, like girls who are beautiful and smart and know it. I also like girls who are direct. They tell you what they want or like or what an issue is without being shy about it. A 60 second conversation will tell me how a girl moves, whether she is smart or not, her socioeconomic background, where she is from, and if she speaks any foreign languages. So the way I see it, a 60s conversation is a better indicator of whether me and a girl will match than a 2 month old Tinder chat log.\n\nI also always made a point since I was a kid to study kinesiology. Most of human conversation is through tone and body language, not words. Women seem to have the ability to read body language like a pro once they hit puberty or so, and this is for all women. Men on the other hand, pretty much across the board, and from birth, do a very poor job of reading nonverbal communication cues and this leads to all sorts of issues arising in life.\n\nMen have to actually study to get any competence at reading nonverbal communication, but it's hugely useful in all avenues of life once you do it. I think it's important to know what people are thinking and when they are lying so I have also studied reading poker tells, some of those anti-liar books written by ex FBI interrogators, and also that NLP \"eye accessing cues\" stuff. There are also a lot of kinesiology body language reading books.\n\nLots of guys try to watch videos or read books written by \"players\" but it is way better to study the stuff I mentioned above because in a crowded and loud situation like a club or festival it gives you the ability to tell if a girl across the room is into you. If a girl is a long time friend or coworker but into you, you will now be able to see that. You can tell if the cute girl at the cafe will give you her number before asking. You can tell your friends which girls want to be asked out by them. It helps with job stuff because you know when someone is mad at you but not saying it, or lying or when you failed a job interview, so you dont even have to stress the rejection letter a week later and can move on. If they are going to hire you, you can tell before you leave the room. All this helps with poker. A lot. You can also tell when someone is going to punch you before they do anything or when violence is about to break out. You can talk your way into the VIP section by checking the scene as you walk up or have a drink and realizing which security guard would be most amenable to persuasion, and then talking to him. It helps with outdoor markets because you can tell before you even open your mouth and start the bidding if this person will take your lowballer bullshit. If you are learning a foreign language all the above stuff helps you understand what someone is saying if you didnt understand their words which is especially helpful if they are mad or about to get mad.The list goes on.\n\nIt's like scientific Jedi Mind Tricks for life and for your whole life you wont ever forget any of it once you learn it because you see it every time you see another person and so the skills are constantly reinforced. I guess for me, it does nullify the need for dating apps.",

It'll help teach men to stop being so nice, flirt a little bit, and play hard to get.\n\nFor the women, it'll stress the importance of being rational, stressing the more important things, like \"will he be a good father?\", \"Does he communicate well?\", \"what are his potential career prospects?\".\n\nThrough AI coaching of gender dynamics, it'll help men be better and be what women want, while also helping women to lower their standards to get both genders to compromise to a happy medium.\n\nGet on it, dating apps.",

It interacts with human mating behaviors in such a way as to prevent pair bonding. It's to the points that the sexes have begun to truly hate each other and to see no value in the company of the opposite sex.\n\nMaybe AI can fix that but it would mean less money for the dating apps. Those apps are designed to prevent the loss of customers, which facilitating marriages would do. They are designed to keep you focused on the next, better match. The paradox of choice is built into the apps (to many choices make people feel dissatisfaction by any choice they make) and humans become disposable objects to be shopped for.\n\nWhat's more likely is that people will start forming intimate relationships with their AIs. We can all have the perfect AI soulmate and use ever advancing forms of immersive technologies for sexual experiences. Humans will begin interacting less and less as time goes on.

People just scroll along from one person to the next—confronted with so many options, that making even a short-term commitment to just one person has become overly complex and unlikely to endure in the long-term—as there are more options to try out. In fact, dating apps no longer have much of an advantage over scrolling for dates, hookups, or future partners on current social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram. Overall, the technology of feeds and streams has transformed human relations into a culture of online hookups and short-term romances/friendships—often as quickly ghosted as they are initiated. Of course, there are exceptions, and long-term relationships are still happening and possible in the offline world , but the overall trend is eroding the traditional.\n\nDifficult to predict what the future may hold for online dating. My thought is that at some point, the dating apps will begin closing down, one after another. And sites for virtual dating, flirting and more will fill in the gaps, such as OnlyFans. Basically, many people will get their dating and intimacy needs met online, rather than taking them into the offline world, where they are cut off from other options and dating moves too slowly for them. Furthermore, AI chat bots will become another option for dating and intimacy. Virtual masks, to hide the real person behind an AI enhanced human, may become popular as well. I know this all sounds bizarre, but the technology and our collective behavior seems to be trending in these directions.",

Rarely are all the roads 100% private. Sure it happens, but things like their intersections with county, city, and state roads are usually in the maintenance budget of the municipality. The VAST majority of that spend is on intersections rather than things like potholes. Over all the entire spend to network a housing development might not be 100% municipal government, but it is certainly somewhat subsidized.\n\nI think what you're referring to is the debt bond problem. All of that initial infrastructure is usually funded though public and private debt. Yes, that debt is never repaid to it's original outlay. So a lot of it is new debt paying for old debt. That is what motivates so much of that expansion.\n\nRegardless it's jobs that determine which suburb/neighborhood people live in. By social class and commutes. Those factors are subsidized by the hub-and-spoke model of old obligations that are paid from capital return by employers in that city. Single family American dream suburbs are a parasite on our cities. Especially now that we need things like broadband, post superstorm Sandy flood management, fire suppression etc.",

It's just you and I in this conversation who else are you referring to?\n\nRegardless asphalt only needs about 2-3% new material by weight to make new asphalt. So if you look at a truck load of it and add a barely noticeable amount maybe it would help to appreciate how efficient it is. To do that recycling they just have to heat it and then mix it. All that can be done via solar power or other green energy. Even diverting petroleum by putting it in bitumen adds value to unrefined petroleum that would otherwise go in gas tanks and thus become a GHG.\n\nThe thing to consider and why development versus maintenance is a factor is that the majority of it's use isn't for new roads. It's for repaving existing roads. As I mentioned earlier the excellent news is that those same roads are made from the same roads. And now that we can make that happen with just solar power, there are less green houses gas emissions than ever.\n\nAnd if you pencil a lot of it out a well paved road is actually reducing GHG due to better mileage and rolling resistance.",

It's ok to only get 10lb of tomatoes instead of 15lb, even if your neighbor with his computer-controlled drip irrigation system gets more.\n\nBut maybe we don't need to start building large urban farms in climate controlled buildings with grow lights in order to supply food to local grocers.",

So buying the cheap one might have a bigger footprint over time. It's why in the article they say to use a raised bed for 20 years instead of 5 to reduce the footprint.\n\nIt makes sense.

Everyone can make an argument that some practices are attractive and others less, and urban/vertical farming has intrisnic positivity and traditional negative.\n\nLeafy greens do great vertically farmed. Its possible that rooftop and vertical farming will produce vast quantities of leafy greens in tiny amounts of space and with vanishingly tiny amounts of water.\n\nLeafy greens also have very few calories. We get our calories from corn, wheat, rice, and other grains whether its fed to animals or not. These plants do not do well in vertical farming because they need a lot more light and you need to grow a lot of those plants to keep up with caloric needs of humans.\n\nSo even if we all sang kumbaya and glass-housed all the vegetables and did vertical farming of all the greens you still need the vast majority of land use dedicated to the staple crops. An entire nuclear powerplant would produce enough energy to light 800 acre equivalent of grains. There are millions of acres of grains under production. Its never gonna happen; massive monoculture is here to stay.\n\nAnd no amount of artificial light or whatever is going to make vertical farming of grain feasible. You need TOO MUCH.\n\nFrankly, the way to reduce land and water use is to reduce the amount of grain needed, which means OUT RIGHT ENDING AND ELIMINATING CORN ETHANOL from the fuel stream, reducing head of livestock by any means necessary, and investing in ridiculously extensive infrastructure to enable efficient farming of water intensive crops in glass-house environments.",

It totally ignores the other upsides of urban farming, like bringing food production closer to where people live (which cuts down on transport emissions), building community, and adding more green to our concrete hellscape cities. These things are super important when you're talking about how sustainable urban farming really is.\n\nThere's also this worry that people making the rules might take this study the wrong way and start clamping down on urban farms. That could mess with people's rights to use their property and put a damper on community projects.\n\nPlus, when they compare urban farming to conventional farming, they're not really looking at the whole environmental cost of big farms, like the long hauls for transport and all the chemicals they use. A more reasonable comparison might show urban farming in a better light.\n\nThe article also kind of ignores that urban farming is always getting better. It's an evolving field, and new tech and methods could make it way more efficient and eco-friendly soon. We shouldn't count it out based on what it's like right now.\n\nAnd lastly, just focusing on the carbon footprint and painting urban farming as bad news might turn people off from what's generally seen as a good thing for the planet. We might end up relying more on the kind of farming that's actually worse for the environment and our economy which is totally not the way we want to go.\n\nSo, yeah, while it's important to know about the carbon footprint, this article could've given a more balanced view and offers a really narrow insight on a a very broad topic.",
