You can deploy a landing page quickly with automatic HTTPS, global CDN, and more.\nPros: Easy deployment, automatic HTTPS, integrates well with modern frameworks.\nCons: Limited to hobby projects on the free tier, with usage limits that might require an upgrade as traffic grows.\nDIY Level: Low. Requires basic knowledge of deployment processes and Git.\nMid-Tier: Netlify (Pro Plan)\nDescription: Netlify offers a more robust solution for static and dynamic sites with its Pro plan. You get features like form handling, serverless functions, and more.\nPros: Easy to use, great for both static and dynamic sites, automatic HTTPS, continuous deployment from Git across all plans.\nCons: Costs can increase with additional features and higher traffic.\nDIY Level: Medium. Similar to Vercel but with more features that might require additional setup.\nCustom/Hard: Self-Hosting\nDescription: Use https://hostinger.com with either a Shared Hosting account, or a VPS for more contrl.\nPros: Full control over the server, scalability, and the ability to host multiple services.\nCons: Requires significant technical knowledge to set up and maintain, including handling server security, updates, and uptime monitoring.\nDIY Level: High. Requires in-depth knowledge of server management, domain configuration, and security.\nRecommendations:\nFor the Client: Given the simplicity of the requirement and the client's limited budget and technical knowledge, starting with a free tier option like Vercel is advisable. It offers an easy way to deploy and manage a landing page without upfront costs.\nDomain Purchase: You should discuss with the client whether they would like to have a custom domain. Purchasing a domain on behalf of the client is common, but they should be aware of the annual renewal fees. I recommend https://namecheap.com.\nHandover: Create detailed documentation on how they can manage the site and renew the domain. This ensures they are not left helpless when you hand over the project.\n\nThis strategy allows you to deliver the project within the client's budget while ensuring they have a professional and functional landing page.",

Your client is wanting something outside of your skill set, and this is going to be far more work than you're expecting.\n\nHowever, if you must, use something like Wix...

If so, use Yugabyte, since it allows you to have both postgres and redis (but it saves to disk) in one program. It’s marked as deprecated but this is a school project, so that doesn’t really matter. Unreplicated should be fine for your demo. If that is not allowed, deploy postgres and redis separately and configure redis for persistence. Put the music binary blobs in REDIS and the keys for said files into postgres. Turn on the REDIS REST API and use that to get data out, but deny uploads without an API key. This allows you to simply point the browser at REDIS and use the native html5 multimedia for audio, and let the browser handle the hard parts. If you do anything other than point the browser at an mp3/oog/flac/whatever audio file and use the builtin controls, you will have a bad time.\n\nStore all data except for the music files in postgres, and you should do decently well and not have a hard time.",

It is okay for solving well defined and solved problems, but it can’t innovate and if you don’t even know how to define your problems well enough, it can’t give you a useful answer. The existence of hallucinations make it a minefield for any non-expert relying on it. The legal ramifications of using AI-generated code trained on code with licenses that don’t explicitly permit that has yet to be hashed out.\n\nIt’s also being massively subsidized by the companies selling it, as a way to build reliance/dependence before they inevitably jack up the prices to make a profit. Copilot costs $10/mo for users, but an estimated $30/mo to Microsoft. Brace yourself for Uber-style surge pricing when there’s heavy demand. It’s too expensive to be a loss-leader.\n\nIf all of these problems do end up getting solved, I see AI as something that will be for us like what compilers were several decades ago.

Links were mostly like /language_code/article_id/slug-in-that-language, with slug actually not having any effect on how site loaded articles, it was purely for ux and seo reasons. /language_code/article_id/some-random-stuff would still load the correct article in that language. I still see this pattern is being used in many e-commerce and blog sites today. Apart from slugs maybe only translating article page url might worth doing. Like if you have something like \"/articles/article-id/article-slug\" translating it to \"/articulos/article-id/article-slug\". But even that's of questionable value.\n\nMay be a bit tangential and anecdotal but one site's search ranking really tanked after adding translations, especially on google.\n\nNot all the articles had translations, some were in 3 languages. I put the language switching links inside the article after the title and the date & author lines as links along the lines of \"Read this article in English\" or \"Lire cet article en français\". They wanted it that way. Because previously they posted all languages at the same page and put a message at the start of the article that said \"You can read this article in English at the bottom\". I did multi language sites before and none of them had this search engine ranking problem. Moving the language switcher to top navigation and changing how it worked fixed the issue. Instead of anchor tags with the href as the other language's url, language switcher set the language in user's session (with an url like /set-langauge/language_code) and redirected to the appropriate article in the new language. If the article did not have a version in the picked language it redirected to homepage.",

For example if you implement multi-lingual URLs you must do so for the content as well and set the appropriate document language. That will avoid any SEO hits. It's just generally not worth it to translate URLs. Just use English or the main language of the site for all URLs.\n\nAs for structured data it's a means of explicitly telling search engines exactly what the website and page are about. This is by far the best SEO method you can employ. All other SEO methods are well old and not all that relevant anymore. Google has a pretty good documentation going into further detail.",

There's just no reason to do this anymore with modern SEO practices. We've been able to describe pages contents to search engines very well for a long time now so doing so using goofy gimmicks like filling the URL with a bunch of keywords aren't necessary and there's no benefit to users as nobody is directly dealing with URLs anymore.

Sites will often market it as \"buy a domain\", but the entire system works the same regardless of how they term it.\n\nA system where people could keep domains forever simply wouldn't work because we'd run out of useful domains (or have to create even more TLDs to confuse people).\n\nThere's also an ongoing cost for the domain registries since they have to run the top-level DNS servers (which tell other computers where to go for detailed information on your domain) and handle other admin tasks (WHOIS and requests for information from authorities, for example).\n\nYou also rarely deal directly with top-level registries. You buy from a middleman registrar instead. One of the reasons domain costs can vary is these registrars may either sell domains at a loss to market their other services, or run \"premium domain\" markets where they try to sell domains for much more.\n\nThere's multiple aspects of \"buy a domain\":\n\nThe domain itself\nDNS - since this is needed to actually do anything useful with a domain, it's usually bundled\nHosting - if you want a website, you're going to need somewhere to host it. Since this is one of the top things people use domains for, it's also often bundled, but there are plenty of services which allow you to get just domain + DNS without hosting too, since many people often have hosting elsewhere",

Also consider registration where someone tries to sign up using an email address for an existing account. You shouldn't respond with \"There's already an account for this email address\".

Time zones make this stuff a nightmare, and being aware of local market and cultural trends is definitely a benefit.\n\nIt's hard to describe the difference, but I'll use accounting as an example. An Australian is going to have a far better idea of local tax regulations in Australia than someone in the Phillipines would.\n\nLikewise, anything that involves health data or protected data depending on your country is a no-go for overseas workers.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're just after something that makes it easier for clients to book an appointment with you (something that doesn't really need local knowledge) then absolutely an overseas contractor makes sense.",

It's currency arbitrage, they can afford to work at that low rates because $ is expensive. The cost of living is low etc\n\nOnce they have a good reputation, they price themselves back to their value or even higher than they would charge locally. But that's besides the point.\n\nThe best way to find the best value for money dev is to vet them properly, look at their work or projects, discuss the job and see how they respond or what ideas they bring in or how they talk about their projects or their work ethics, you are not looking for all the right answers, all you need is honesty and understanding.\n\nGood luck.",

Vector graphics need to be rasterized somewhere down the line, so the time complexity is dependent on amount of primitives that need to be rendered. So if your vector graphics has a lot of objects, \"pre-rasterizing\" it may be faster. But where that point is, generally only experimentation can tell.\n\nThe other tradeoff you have to consider though is space complexity, which I guess is even more important in webdev if graphics have to be fetched over the network. In this case, the space required to store vector graphics will be much, much smaller for most use cases than for raster images.",

Proper log in function, email validation (no repeats) and password hashing. UI letting user know that the information is being saved when switching fields. It's pretty fast. Solid backend from what I could see in a quick scan, though I do not code in python.\n\nThe Bad : Design, which I understand was a last minute pivot and not the focus of the project, but I almost did not make it past the login screen. Some of the Templates came up as undefined and would not render. UI rendering issues with the nav. I could see my password data in the network tab when it was being sent off. No way to upload and parse a already made resume.\n\nOverall: Not half bad! I like the execution. There are a ton of these out there but I feel for a project this is a great starting point as an MVP. I was pleasantly surprised after getting passed the login screen and diving in. Might even fork it, change a few things (Probably use React) and use it for personal use. Great job. Also bonus points for putting yourself out there for some feedback, I know how it feels to want to show off something you've put a lot of time and effort into.",

Then do a detailed quote after armed with all this extra information.\n\nBasically, don't spend time doing a quote when you don't know their budget, and don't commit to a quote for a complex system until you've been paid for a few days at least to scope it out properly.

Based on the detailed requirements you've provided, your project involves complex functionalities including user authentication, dynamic form handling, scheduling, automated calculations, digital signatures, email integrations, and real-time updates. Here's a rough estimate range categorized by development phases:\n\nPlanning and Design: This includes wireframing, designing the UI/UX, and planning the app architecture. It might take between 80 to 160 hours depending on the complexity and the number of revisions.\n\nFrontend Development: Developing a responsive web application and mobile app (assuming you want a hybrid app that works on both iOS and Android) could range from 400 to 800 hours. This considers the implementation of the UI/UX design, form handling, session logging, real-time alerts, and other client-side functionalities.\n\nBackend Development: Building the server, database, and application logic, including authentication, scheduling logic, automatic calculations, email notifications, and digital signature processing, might take between 400 to 800 hours. This includes setting up the infrastructure for real-time updates and ensuring data integrity.\n\nTesting and Quality Assurance: This phase involves manual and automated testing to ensure the app is bug-free and meets all requirements. Estimating around 100 to 200 hours for thorough testing across all devices and platforms is reasonable.\n\nProject Management and Communication: Effective management and regular communication are crucial for the success of the project. Allocating around 10% of the total development hours to this would be wise, adding approximately 100 to 200 hours.\n\nMaintenance and Upgrades: Post-launch support, bug fixes, and updates are essential for keeping the app running smoothly. This is often calculated as a percentage of the initial development cost, around 15-20% annually.\n\nAssuming an average hourly rate for a development team varies greatly depending on their location, expertise, and your negotiation, but let's use a mid-range rate of $75/hour for calculation.\n\nAdding up these estimates gives a total of: - Minimum: ( (80 + 400 + 400 + 100 + 100) \\times $75 ) = $81,000 - Maximum: ( (160 + 800 + 800 + 200 + 200) \\times $75 ) = $198,000\n\nTherefore, a rough estimate for the entire project could range from $81,000 to $198,000. This is a broad estimate and could vary significantly based on the specific details of your project, the team's location, and the exact specifications you decide on during the planning phase. It's also important to consider ongoing costs for hosting, maintenance, and updates.",

What the client is asking for isn't anything new, quite the contrary. Look for a COTS solution with a white label option. 5k would then go towards the purchase, customization and configuration...which all of a sudden becomes a lot more reasonable, much faster, and possibly more profitable (profit vs time spent).\n\nThis may not pan out, but from your client's perspective, this is probably the smartest solution for their business.

I listen to what they want, give them the estimate, and if it is above budget, start cutting things out, or downgrading some things.\n\nI am honest about what I think won't matter if it is cut or downgraded - like \"you said you wanted this feature / or this level quality materials, and that is what I estimated for, but in my experience you don't really need that. You will never miss it, so let's leave it out or downgrade.\" Offer less expensive alternatives trying to show that you are working to bring it down to an acceptable level for both of you, but you cannot simply give them what they initially asked for and pay the difference out of your pocket.",

Here is a suggested response you could tailor to your situation:\n\nDear [Client's Name],\n\nThank you for your response and for considering our proposal for the development of your custom billing tool. We understand that budgeting for such projects is a significant consideration for your business, and we appreciate your perspective on the cost.\n\nHowever, after reviewing your counteroffer of $5,000, we feel it is essential to clarify the scope and complexity of the project, along with the resources required to deliver a tool that meets your needs and expectations.\n\nOur initial estimate of $33,000, based on 300 hours of development work at $110 per hour, is grounded in a detailed analysis of the following factors:\n\nCustom Development: The process involves building a bespoke solution tailored to your specific business requirements, which includes multiple stages such as planning, design, development, testing, and deployment.\nQuality and Scalability: To ensure the tool is reliable, user-friendly, and scalable, it necessitates the use of modern technologies and frameworks, along with thorough testing.\nExpertise: The project requires a team of experienced developers, designers, and QA specialists who can guarantee the delivery of a high-quality product.\nSupport and Maintenance: Our estimate also accounts for initial support and maintenance post-launch to address any potential issues and ensure smooth operation.\n\nWe understand that the difference between our estimate and your budget expectation is significant. However, the investment in a custom billing tool is not merely an expense but a valuable asset to your business that streamlines operations, enhances efficiency, and provides a foundation for future growth.\n\nThat said, we are more than willing to explore options that could bring the project closer to your budget, without compromising on the essential features and quality. This could include phasing the project, prioritizing key functionalities for initial development, or exploring alternative solutions within your budget range.\n\nWe are committed to working with you to find a viable path forward and would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further. Your business success is our priority, and we believe that investing in the right technology is a step towards that goal.\n\nThank you for considering our perspective. We look forward to your thoughts and hope to continue this conversation.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position]\n[Your Contact Information]",

With plenty of room for your db service.\n\nOn the frontend, A load balancer and a few small boxes should be all you need for that traffic. Could even just consider lambdas for the frontend.\n\nThe thing you'll want skill in is containerization with docker/docker compose.\n\nThe cool thing about your own vps, it can do anything and be as flexible as you want while costing fractions of the managed service.\n\nThe bad thing, you have to manage it.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure ppl understand just how easy it is to spin up a production ready db with docker on a $5 box. Digital ocean has a backup service.\n\nGetting your firewalls and all that setup aside, once you're through the setup phase, it just works.\n\nOne things for sure, you're going to need to be comfortable with bash, makefile, docker, and/maybe k8s.

You will need to register an account to save items in a cart. [link to register]\"\n\nAlso, I would put the \"spend a night with my art\" somewhere in the main page as well, not just in the bottom footer.

Especially when you're paying almost the same.\n\nAnd for big projects, I would discuss expected milestones with the developer and come up with a compensation structure based on that. There are way too many scummy freelancers who just walk when they're paid upfront.",

All trades pass through our warehouse and we do quality checks to make sure items meet promised conditions. Essentially, we just mediate the trade to break it down.\n\nWe have a messaging system, we allow users to add cash to the trade (but not direct sale), we allow users to post for free as much as they want. Accounts are free, always. There are 2 payment options - pay per trade + shipping and a subscription (for people trading a lot and not wanting to pay every time for the service fee)\n\nUnfortunately, this is why we came here. I’ve been told by a few different agencies after seeking some extra help that with freelancers this happens all the time. In the event that this was the case, we aren’t sure how to approach it. We’ve asked for an idea on when he would be done but he tells what we already know and says “work will always be done with websites”\n\nWe are definitely out of the window that he had said we would be at a spot to have the website ready to go.\n\nHe also claimed to have a team that works with him. We aren’t sure, we just want this completed, ya know?",

Off the top of my head the team would need to\n\nimplement auth\ndesign or integrate an ordering and invoicing system\nfigure out your shipping procedures (integrate with carrier APIs possibly to include shipping charges in the total; some carriers offer partner discounts and this would require a backend flow).\nimplement the user messaging\nimplement whatever search features you need for users to find trades\nintegrate with a warehouse ticketing system on the backend, or design a solution if it doesn't exist\npossibly implement ratings for users\ndesign a UI\nbuild testing and deployment workflows\n\n^ This is off the cuff and most likely there are more complexities that will crop up.\n\nAlso keep in mind when freelancers tell you they have a team, this usually means they're subcontracting. Coordinating subcontractors means your freelancer has his own management overhead to deal with, he might even be subcontracting to a cut rate agency based out of Bangladesh etc. and could end up massively delaying development. Your freelancer may be different, but this is unfortunately pretty common.",

Never give contract to any 3rd World Agency (unless you're fine with project delays | PRO: they might even deliver quality product but delays will be a constant.)\n\n👇 3. Never give contract to 3rd World Freelancers/Contractors (unless you're comfortable with vetting process, everyone is a freelancer back there)\n\n👇 4. Never give contract to a European Dev (they're mostly lazy) and very bad in terms of providing support on Products they deliver. Plus time delays is also a factor.\n\n👇 5. Never give contract to a European Agency (they are same as Indian Agencies just 4x more expensive)\n\nVery simple don't hire Western Agencies. It's guaranteed they'll charge very high. Most of them aren't even better than 3rd World Agencies which might deliver quality work but with heavy delays.\n\nYour project isn't even complex it's just a few APIs and I'm pretty sure you ain't expecting 30K+ traffic. But you'd find Western Devs/Agencies over hyping the importance for quality. I understand quality is required but most world runs on average software. You ain't building Netflix, quality stuff is overkill here but Western Devs usually use this excuse to milk money.\n\nEverything has its pros and cons. Save it up, it will help you ahead.",
