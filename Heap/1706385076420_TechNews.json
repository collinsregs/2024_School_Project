The NFL is getting paid $110 million to allow this game to be exclusively streamed on Peacock. That‚Äôs a lot of money for one game, so you can understand why the NFL is willing to lose viewers and ‚Äúexperiment.‚Äù\n\nFor Peacock, the same is true but for a different reason: they‚Äôre trying to build up the audience to a paid streaming app that is losing billions of dollars in an era where people are dropping cable. A number of analysts have called Peacock a ‚Äústruggling‚Äù service in an era where everyone is trying to figure out ways to generate revenue and audiences from streaming.",

I was explaining to my kid how we used to just be able to walk to the gate with our families after getting our boarding passes and hugging them goodbye before getting on the plane. No need to show up 3 hours prior to deal with lines and the TSA, no limit on liquids and keeping shoes and jackets on if you didn‚Äôt pay for pre-check.\n\nI long for the simplicity of yesterday with the advancements of today.",
