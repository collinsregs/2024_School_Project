This heavily restricts lateral movement. Its free and easy to setup.\nSecurity Awareness Training - Try to find a solution to do quarterly training for employees regarding phishing, business email compromise and safe internet usage.\nVulnerability Management - Scan your environment with a vuln scanner to identify vulns. Ensure the IT teams are patching systems with regularly released monthly patches, and emergency patching for any 0 days/critical vulnerabilities that are in scope for your environment (which you will know once you start tracking assets).\nPassword policies - Ensure your company is using appropriate password policies and that they are enforced.\nSecure Email Gateway - Ensure all email that comes into your environment is being scanned for malware or phishing and that it is capable of blocking/pulling emails that are malicious.\n\nYes, you will eventually need policies, risk assessments, business impact analysis and BCP, disaster recovery, but that level of maturity takes top down buy in and leadership. It also can take a while to get in place. If you are a lower level employee who has a more technical role, then those are the basic blocking and tackling that will help protect your organization as it matures.",

It's the same process as any employer running HTTPS would have to do anyway, except instead of adding one additional cert, they may add a few dozen.

This has been posted a few times (if not here, then must've been other subs) and after thinking about it some more, it seems like there's an obvious fix. One or more of the following must be true:\n\nThe Snapchat message in question was not encrypted, either due to a failure of the app / infrastructure or design.\nThe Snapchat message in question was indeed encrypted, but the encryption was intercepted by a sanctioned AITM attack (such as HTTPS inspection). I initially thought this was unlikely, since it would require installing a certificate on the device. That's how it works in my employer; every issued device has our certs preloaded so inspection is nearly transparent to the end user. HOWEVER, it would be very easy for Snapchat to accept other certificates, either by ignoring certificate mismatch errors or by trusting multiple certificates. It seems unlikely that Snapchat would be able to trust literally every HTTPS inspection source out there, but it's plausible that they could install a number of certificates to cover major points of presence like major international airports, select government agencies, \"trusted\" network partners, and so on.\nSnapchat monitors messages for certain key words or phrases. Even if the communication was truly E2EE, the app still has access to the messages by necessity.\nSoftware on the device capture the message out of band, such as by clandestine screen captures. In other words, perhaps the user had malware on their device.\nWe aren't getting all the details, or the details we have are wrong.\n\nRegarding option #2, it would be entirely technically possible for Snapchat to say \"JFK airport is running a Checkpoint HTTPS inspection appliance on their public wifi, and we're going to trust their replacement certificate. They'll send us regular replacement certificates as they expire\". This is trivial. The only difference from a conventional HTTPS inspection setup is that the certs are trusted at the application level rather than the OS.",

Have you performed an nmap scan?\nAre you supposed to be running the enumeration along a particular non-standard port number? For example, Hack The Box Academy often spawns its instances along particular ports that are atypical (i.e. not 80/443) in order to accommodate its large userbase.\nLike /u/cerebron mentioned, many machines require you to edit your /etc/hosts file to point a particular machine instance IPv4 address to a given URL. Otherwise, your browser/tools don't know how to resolve the host (i.e. \"I don't know where http://vulnerablemachine.htb is!\").",

        "comment": "Good question(s).\n\nA couple things to bear in mind:\n\nIt's totally appropriate for someone who has developed years of subject-matter expertise to try to make a go of things on their own and start a business. When you have folks who are genuinely good at what they do, it's understandable that they'd want to try and market those skillsets for more than what they'd get on someone else's dime.\nI may have misread your post, but you're going to be in a bad way if you both try to remain employed for an employer AND are actively looking to steal business away from that employer for your own independent contracts. That's a definite conflict of interest (and could potentially land you in legal trouble if you're leveraging proprietary NDA insights of your employer in the pursuit of said contracts).\nBy contrast, it would be appropriate to reach out to clients you've worked with to bid on working with them after you've left your employer. They know you and you know them; assuming they want to stick with you, then that's just a business decision on their part.\nThere's a whole host of business logistics that's getting glossed over and hand-waived in this post that's worth looking into. How are you looking to structure your business for tax purposes? How many employees are you going to take on? What provider are you going to go with for their benefits (i.e. medical, dental, etc.)? What are your operating costs? How familiar are you with assorted state/federal laws/regulations (e.g. PCI, HIPAA, etc.) which will apply to your various clients and how you perform your work? What overhead/architecture do you need to setup to be lawfully compliant yourself? Do you know how long (and what type) of data you're legally required to retain? Do you know how to properly store/dispose of it? So on and so forth. These and other questions involve a non-trivial amount of work that separate \"safe bet\" companies apart from eager kids with Metasploit and a bank account; that they are considered and accounted for will go a long way in both attracting clients and retaining them.\nThere is a lot of competition in this space, so you're going to need some way of distinguishing your business apart from others. Some upsell penetration tests atop other typical MSP-like functions; some utilize crowdsourced talent (e.g. Synack) to reduce costs; some rely on personal relationships with smaller, localized businesses. You have an idea at the moment, but you haven't identified a competitive edge.\nImportantly, a non-trivial amount of your time will be spent on business administration (vs. performing penetration tests) when you own a small business; some of that responsibility was alluded to in the questions in the earlier bullet, but it needs to be emphasized. A disproportionate amount of your time will be in service to figuring out where your next contract is going to come from, how to manage/secure sales, etc. Since most penetration testing engagements are very brief (a few days to maybe a week or two) and that of those, most clients only need one performed annually (sometimes biannually, if at all), you can start to see that you're quickly going to need to on the look for additional clients (and that's assuming that your old clients return to contract you again).\n\nBest of luck!",

        "comment": "Hi,\n\nI would highly advise AGAINST learning cryptography at the beginning, as it will bore you to death, takes all the fun out of it and is not such a core aspect for an every day to day work day.\n\nStart simple - make yourself familiar what CS is. This is something TryHackMe does very well here: https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/introtocyber\n\nThis might help you decide which area of security you are interested in - Offense vs Defense. In addition, it will highlight possible careers in CS as well, which might help your decision making.\n\nAs it is independent of your role (offensive vs defensive), learn the web basics - which can be found here: https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/web\n\nThis will teach you more fundamentals- maybe not super detailed, but you get a glimpse into it + you get some hands-on introductions.\n\nAs I mentioned in another post - fundamentals are the key to success. Too many people simply learn how to use tools, doing certifications & trainings on platforms (even TryHackMe), yet lack the fundamentals. This is something where you have to go the extra mile yourself.\n\nHowever, learning should be fun and hands-on learning is even more fun. Just try to incorporate some fundamentals research down the path and be curious. Ask ChatGPT to explain certain things simple and with analogies.\n\nGood luck & all the best!\n\nEdit: typos",

Those will help you get your resume through the filters for apply for jobs.\n\nAlso, if there’s a way for you to do internships during the summer?\n\nBut I would also network like crazy! Does your school have a student led and run cybersecurity organization? Join that! Go to local hackerspaces and/or local meetups.",

But that changed in July of last year when the SEC required companies to disclose it in a matter of days. This further illustrates when left to companies to do things they will always do the bare minimum. That’s just a fact.\n\nAs long as companies are allowed to keep doing things with that mindset. Which is the bare minimum. Things will be operated in that capacity. Until regulations change and require companies to do more when it comes to data security. They will keep getting their ass handed to them by hackers. Because let’s be real, they think less of it.

There are a ludicrous amount of variables in the success of that task. From maintenance, engineering, design, regulation, personnel, fuel, weather, acts of God, training, equipment etc.\n\nWe expect perfection every time we fly in that we arrive alive and unharmed. To say that a company shouldn't be held accountable by a jury is asinine. Everytime something happens in that industry it changes to further mitigate that risk and if negligence on behalf of the company was discovered they were always sued. There's many industries that face the impossible task of striving for perfection in their mission despite the unknown or unintended consequences.\n\n2 healthcare, as a patient you expect the provider to do everything in their power to heal you or remedy the issue. Human health issues are perpetually evolving giving the providers the impossible task of remediating and protecting against the unknown. Do we hold them accountable when a newly evolved strain comes around with no known cures? No, they do the best they can. However, if your surgeon neglected to properly sanitize himself prior to operating and introduced a complication post op then they will be held accountable. Or if a nurse is exhausted and gives the wrong medication and patient dies. The organization will get sued as a consequence of their negligence whether it was staff, procedure, accident etc.\n\nThe two industries are more extreme in that a life could be at risk but the premise remains the same. We demand perfection even when in reality it's statistically improbable. To say that the cyber industry shouldn't be held accountable when negligence occurs is in my opinion not how it should be handled. If a jury/organization can conclude that air France is not at fault in the Concord accident that occurred at the Charles degaul airport despite knowing the tires were physically being operated at the bleeding edge of material physics, aircraft design, etc and instead place blame on an improperly installed engine trim piece that fell off of the aircraft that took off prior to the Concord performing the roll out I think they can handle holding organizations accountable and determine if their cyber practices/policies are/were negligent. Therefore making the industry as a whole better by forcing accountability and change",

However, SaaS can quickly become the new \"Shadow IT\" when end users and business units just sign up for services without going through an internal review process.\n\nFor IT Security, this is where a CASB or Cloud App Security Broker comes in. The CASB can monitor SaaS apps in use by the company by ingesting log traffic, and then displaying a report showing the compliance and security risk of a SaaS app, as well as which users are using it, how much data is being transferred, etc.\n\nHere is a look at Microsoft's CASB app discovery report: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/discovered-apps#deep-dive-into-discovered-apps\n\nFrom there, you can sanction, unsanction, or block the application for the org.

Yes there are many different areas but it feels like it’s going to be every org like ISC2 and CompTia offering basically the same career progression of certifications (Sec+ to CASP+ vs CC to CISSP). Not sustainable and not healthy for the industry as people don’t know what to get and often have to navigate for their job and such. It seems like a money and time suck, rather than focusing on securing the systems in some instances.\n\n3) Cyber often thought of as a loss leader for companies unless they sell cyber, must do it for compliance, or have been hacked/leaders who are aware of reputations damage.

As much as I respect CrowdStrike, their motto is literally \"We Stop Breaches.\" Are you really sure that is always the case? What happens when CS can't be deployed (Docker, Cloud, Legacy Systems) or is disabled? Or it just gives an alert and not a block? At that point its on someone to respond to it.\n\nWe have done an awful job at training humans to be cyber aware. For example, you have many folks who overly cautious when they are out in public. They know the dangers out there. Meanwhile that same person has no f'ing problem clicking on random links or downloading fake browser updates from crocheting websites. Computer Training will never be enough, but hey we have a \"month\" to celebrate cyber awareness!\n\nRisk vs. Revenue. If it isn't business related, why is it allowed on the corporate internet? Everyone has a phone to look up the dumb stuff. Why is Janice in Finance or Mark in Sales getting newsletters from their local school PTA or barstool sports? Excuses I've heard from executive management typically stems around \"creating a positive atmosphere where people feel like they aren't working!\" type stuff. And that is from CIO's, which is naturally to #4\n\nCISOs are still too new to the C-Suite world, and most still report up through a CIO/CSO to the COO and then the CEO. Change is never going to happen across the company when profits and end-user experience are the forefront of a CIO and COO's mind. Security hampers productivity in their eyes and can cause outages if the solution fails. The average revenue increase for a company is 10% annually. When times get hard, the books get opened by the bean counters on where to cut costs. Cost Centers, such as IT in general, are usually one avenue that gets put under the lens.\n\nWe don't condition our SOC analyst (through the spectrum of fields) on how to actually read detections and investigate properly. They are conditioned to move quickly through the alerts so it doesn't get backlogged and the blend of more FPs over TPs begins to build a sense of comfort blanket around them. My own analogy I've had to use with leadership, \"You've conditioned every analyst to feel like they are on a patrol around a secure perimeter. Everything that even moves calls in a special investigation team of 2-3 more people. Come to find out it is just a rabbit in the bush. It happens again but now only the 1 person investigates. Then it happens again, only it wasn't a bunny. But they aren't responding the same way because they all think it is just the rabbit again.\"\n\nThe real C-Suite are not held accountable. Sure a CISO or two have been indicted, but no CEO or Board has faced any level of investigative power from any authority. Keep in mind those authorities can easily kill their little circle of golden parachutes by enforcing they can no longer hold an Officer or Board position in a company. What cybersecurity is facing is literally why things like SOX were created for CFOs and CEOs to be held accountable if the books got cooked. There is nothing with any remote semblance of teeth out there to make a C-Suite feel their wellbeing is in limbo because of a security lapse. And sadly, that whole collective group knows they'll only be at a company for a handful of years before they jump to the next branch. They just need to keep their revenue and shareholders happy while they cash 7-figure checks and await the Board positions they so desperately seek.",
