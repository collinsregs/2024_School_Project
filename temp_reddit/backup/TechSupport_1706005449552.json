As for the local computer shop I would tread cautiously when they are talking about board level repairs as replacing chips/resistors and all other small board components is a challenging and time consuming task and will not guarantee they fix the issue as they probably don't know until they start replacing if the fault is fixed. Board level repairs are usually there when all other options are exhausted and the device is a must to be restored. I would try find some tech repair company that will look into component level repairs such as swapping out like for like the suspect parts. Unfortunately I believe apple in recent years now sticks ID chips on parts to marriage with the device it comes from (if this is the case then the only work around is to remove the id chip from old and install onto the replacement usually by means of desolder and solder by expensive equipment probably what the guy is quoting to do). Apple repairs can suck.",

Now check reviews on the repair guy (if there are any) and check if he has built up a good reputation. Also I assume that part of the price is for buying said part to replace and do note that he runs a business so he has to make money on his end. Now if he is buying Apple certified replacement parts I heard that they do not treat third parties very well and the part will be more expensive. Back on topic, you also have to account for the time and labor that the repair guy puts in to fixing your laptop and the level of knowledge and skill that it takes to repair a laptop. Macbooks especially are designed by Apple to make it harder to repair and one wrong move and the repair guy may lose a couple months paycheck. With all this in mind the decision is all up to you. Take to Apple for $600 or the repair guy for $250. I guess you have the option to shop around more to check out other places but I would personally take my Macbook to repair guy.",

I had WOL working and then it stopped which is why I switched to the SmartPlug and so far so good. Obviously it uses some power to run the WiFI module but that will be minuscule and probably no more than the PC 'watching' the Ethernet.\n\nMy workflow goes turn on the SmartPlug, when I see the power go up wait a minute then remote to my PC. When I finish I shut down the PC from the GUI as normal. Then wait when I see the SmartPlug drop to 1 watt or so I know the PC is effectively off so can toggle the plug off too.",

For drives, there is mainly alive & dead. \"Corrupted beyond repair\" in drives is just a small sector that could corrupt the OS, but it wouldn't prevent chkdsk from completing.\n\nIf after work tomorrow, the issue persists, it could be one of many different problems. The most common one I've seen: It's a cheapy laptop with a tiny SSD that you've filled to 90%. I've seen numerous 128G drives that get overloaded by windows updates and pretty much makes you reinstall windows (annoying). Good luck.",

The current generation of flash storage drives is unaffected.\n\nThis crucial SMART characteristic signals issues with the actuator arm, read/write head, and disk surface—the platter that houses the data. A greater likelihood of disk failure is indicated by a higher RAW Read Error Rate.\n\nIf it is not fixed quickly, it may result in irreversible data loss. For a hard drive, RAW Read Error Rate denotes the following:\n\n- Earliest sign of a failed drive\n\n- Corruption of Data\n\n- Mechanical malfunction\n\n- Data loss is caused by electrical problems\n\nTo put it briefly, the drive needs to be replaced because it is physically worn out. Create a \"healthy\" clone of your disk using a disk cloning application. Then, if necessary, use data recovery software on this clone to retrieve any lost data.\n\nRaw Read Error Rate is not a fixed value, just like other SMART metrics. Getting a new hard drive and backing it up before things grow worse would be my best course of action, or you can keep using it and backing it up everytime until it will no longer work, as long as you have backups of it, I wouldn't worry an inch.",

The OS is built of Binary Files which have very little, to no, compression possibility.\n\nCompression is the idea of removing repeated data and/or removing blank space in files. Word documents having the word \"the\" repeated thousands of times is heavily compressible. Files with completely random content, System/OS files, are not very compressible.\n\nAs for the best compression technology, I'd suggest using xz or 7z, for the best compression (though again, neither of these provide any beneficial compression on OS/binary files)",

These are Compression + Archiving (folders/files). What you are after is compressing a SINGLE binary file, which is a raw image of the partition.\n\nHow are you planning on taking an image of the partition? This must be done while the OS is offline and will be done to an external media device.\n\nOnce you have the raw image of the partition, with an extension such as .img or .bin, you'd then take that file use a compression algorithm to compress that single file.\n\n(An OS is not simply just files in a folder, its much more tied to partitions. If you're thinking you are compressing the main partition by taking a backup of C:\\, that is incorrect.)",

I'd check then if your issue stops, and if so, slowly re-introduce your USB peripherals until the issue is noticed. It can be caused by a damaged USB device/cable causing interference.",

Do not put anything other than a single GPU connector on a single cable coming out of the PSU.

It will take maybe 30mins to an hour and you might have to fill out some forms and provide photo ID.\n\nSamsung s10 is an ok phone but you can get some cheap motorolas and others for $100 that have cameras and are close to the iphone specs. My Samsung A23 has a better camera than an iphone and was $200",

Now, my solution will most likely not solve your issue, however, you might be able to follow a similar diagnostic procedure to identify the problem. I too was having similar issues as you along with an entire reset of chosen color scheme (I run an alienware laptop) every time a freeze occurred. Imo, if you already done all of the various driver/bios updates possible, it’s time to take a peek at your Event Viewer for error codes. You can find this under Start > Control Panel > System and Security > Administrative Tools. Double-click Event Viewer. It’s tedious and hard to understand, but some googling will help you if you are encountering errors. I would record the time at which my game froze, then compare that to the event viewer to see what my system was encountering. This is a good strategy of problem isolation. Again, this isn’t a fix for your direct issue, but it can be a good way to help in the diagnosis stage.",

You can't trust their privacy, and the other party could simply contact Apple or their mobile provider and declare them stolen, rendering them useless.\n\nGet them a prepaid phone for the near term and move on from there.

This could be due to various issues such as file system corruption, bad sectors, or other disk-related problems.To troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue, follow these steps:\n\nEnsure that the drivers for the external HDD are up to date.\n\nRun CHKDSK: Open Command Prompt as an administrator and run the CHKDSK command on the RAW drive.\n\nchkdsk /f E:\n\nThis can help identify & fix any file system or disk errors (refer to the detailed guide if needed).\n\nUse a reputable data recovery tool that supports RAW file system recovery, such as iBoysoft Data Recovery, to retrieve lost files.

My old router/wifi (a/b/g) was upstairs and my repeater was downstairs. I'd get 1-3 mbs throughput. I just swapped it out for some tplink deco wifi 6 mesh units, and my throughpout jumped to 20mps at far locations!\n\nThere are things called powerline adapters. They send a data signal through your electrical wiring. You plug one into the wall at the source and use it's ethernet port to plug into the router/switdch, and then plug one into an outlet at your destination, and plug a switch/router/computer/etc. into its ethernet port. They may give you better throughput. You'd have to find one though with European electrical standards.",

        "comment": "This sounds frustrating. On the upside, you've done some good work here. A few questions:\n\nWhen the outages occur, both hardwired and Wi-fi internet doesn’t work.\n\nWhen you are connected and experiencing an outage, have you tried a ping to an internet resource by IP address? For example: open a command line window (Windows, Mac, and Linux all have easy ways to do this) and then type \"ping 8.8.8.8\". Do you get a result? Does you get a message that the request timed out? Does it say something along the lines of \"destination unreachable\"?\n\nI have been dealing with it for months\n\nHas the service ever worked reliably, or has it been unstable since it was installed? If it worked reliably before, can you recall anything that might have changed in the time since? Have you done any work inside your home, remodeling or moving furniture around perhaps, that might have damaged something? Any electrical work, DIY or by a professional? Can you recall construction outside in your neighborhood? Any service workers up on poles?\n\nHave you been in touch with any neighbors to see if they A) use the same provider, and B) experience the same or similar issues?\n\nAs I log into the router as an admin, none of its logs even show the loss in connectivity whatsoever.\n\nHave you logged into the router while you were experiencing the outage? Are there any troubleshooting/diagnostic tools available in the router web UI? Even just a \"ping\" option that lets you test connectivity to an external resource (e.g., a DNS server like 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1) can help.",

If DNS is the problem, it can appear to users as a general internet outage while the router and your ISP show no connectivity loss. I imagine an uptime monitor would be using the IP address as well, but I would want to prove it myself.",

Does it come in from the basement or attic, or some other place? Is the connection exposed at all? You can look for signs of potential damage like animal droppings, chewed bits of wall or floor, etc. You may need to contact an electrician who works with communication wiring to trace it out for you.\n\nYou can also ask Xfinity support to check signal levels. If the issue was purely with internal wiring (damage, bad termination, etc), I would expect you to have some amount of signal loss all the time and not just during an outage. Be extra observant when you experience outages. Do you notice any lights flickering around that time? Any climate control systems turning on to heat/cool the home? Boiler, tankless water heater, microwaves, any other high draw or \"noisy\" appliances starting/stopping during outages?",

Like the letter \"T\". If you want the signal to do in the direction of the downstroke, they should be horizontal. So move them so they're perpendicular to the direction of your computer.\n\nBut that will only make a little difference. If you have slightly older equipment, consider a mesh system. I had a wifi router that was Wifi b/g/n or something. It was several years old. I had a repeat downstairs, and while there was a signal downstairs, it was sluggish and slow. I put in a pair of Wifi 6 TPLink Deco mesh units. All I did was drop them in and did some real simple configuring. My speed increased dramatically everywhere! From 1-3mbps to 15 or 20 mbps at remote spots.",

A single Wifi 6 mesh unit should help, but you could also add a 2nd one at any location further away from the main one to extend the signal further. In the meantime, you could try directing the antenna of what you have better. Extend your arms out in front of you. Bend your elbows so that your hands are pointing straight up. If they were antenna, the strongest signal would be reaching out directing in front of you to wherever you are facing. Angle the antennas so they're in the orientation and it may help, depending on their orientation before.\n\nBut you definitely are restricting yourself with that old device you have. I don't know about others like eero, but I have TPLink Deco WiFi 6, and when I replaced my older device and repeater with them, my throughput increase was amazing.",

The AP is basically an Ethernet to WiFi bridge. So, it sends/receives traffic between its Ethernet and WiFi ports. Your router sees the AP and any devices connected to the AP as wired devices.\n\nThere are two ways to configure a Unifi AP: smartphone app or controller software. Which method are you using?\n\nEither way, you should check the AP’s WiFi settings. You’ll probably want to verify that its 5 GHz radio is enabled and configured with a SSID.",

        "comment": "GIF uses lossless compression (producing the highest quality outputs), but it has a limited color palette. So if the original image has more than 256 colors, there will be a reduction in visual quality in the GIF output due to missing colors. GIF files, due to their use of lossless compression, can also be larger than WebM or WebP files using lossy compression. One advantage of GIF files is that you can specify how long each animation frame will be displayed for, so you can have pauses in the animation without data/frames needing to be encoded for that time. GIFs also support a 1-bit alpha channel for marking certain pixels/regions as transparent (invisible).\n\nWebM is optimized for audio/video content with lossy compression. It acts as a container for storing video encoded in VP8, VP9, or AV1 formats and (optionally) audio in Vorbis or Opus formats. WebM supports a full range of colors (unlike GIF), but there may be a slight reduction in visual quality compared to GIF particularly when representing images/animations with fewer than 257 colors. It is possible to achieve smaller file sizes with WebM compared to GIF, but the frame rate is constant, so if your animation has long pauses (for example) then some data still needs to be encoded for each paused frame. There is no native/universal support for an alpha (transparency) channel with WebM, but there are technical workarounds to achieve alpha transparency (if the player knows how to properly process the data stream).\n\nWebP is optimized for full color images and animations with either lossy or lossless compression. Unlike WebM, WebP does not support audio or timeline scrubbing, but it does have a native 8-bit alpha channel to support transparency (for each pixel you can control how transparent/translucent it should be, i.e. how visible background content should be through that pixel). Compared to GIF animations, WebP animations are usually much smaller in file size, even when using lossless compression. WebP also tends to produce smaller file sizes than WebM for most animations. WebP is not as universally supported as GIF, so some software may be able to open/display GIFs but not WebP animations. Compared to WebM, WebP has greater compatibility with photo/image editing programs (WebM files are really only designed be opened in video players/editors).",

So in that regard only, it's more secure to use a self-signed cert than to use plain HTTP.\n\nThe benefit you see with a pre-trusted certificate is that someone somewhere is creating a \"chain of trust\" that means you're not only using encrypted communications to talk to a site, but you can be fairly certain the site is who they say they are. With a self-signed certificate, that's pushed to the end user to make the calls about origin authenticity, and 99.999% of people don't know how to check that thoroughly and 75% of that .001% is probably not going to check.\n\nThat \"chain of trust\" is you trusting your OS or browser manufacturer, who trusts a Certificate Authority (CA), who went through some process to confirm that the certificate requestor is also the entity who's publicly recognized as the rightful owner of the site. It is possible to change this chain of trust to include \"your IT department created their own CA and issues certificates internally, and told all company computers to trust certificates they've issued\", that that comes with it's own challenges and vulnerabilities.",

So let's make a comparison.\n\nIn http, you get a letter which says it's from your friend John, you write a letter back. You have no idea if it's actually from John, and anyone who picks up the letter can read it.\n\nIn HTTPS with a self signed cert, you receive a letter that says it's from John. It's written in code that you've previously received instructions to decrypt. You encrypt your reply and write him an encrypted letter. You still have no idea if it's actually from John, but at least anyone who picks up the letter can't read it. You can search up \"SSL Handshake\" to get a better idea of how the encryption is set up.\n\nIn a proper HTTPS setup, you get the encrypted letter and a chain of proofs which leads to a source you trust that the sender is John. Now you can be fairly certain that the sender is indeed John, and that no one else can read your messages.\n\nHistorically, HTTP was faster than HTTPS and so some sites would still stick with HTTP. However, updates to HTTPS have made the time difference negligible, and sometimes even faster (since HTTP didn't get the update). It does add more setup and points of failure to a system, so some dark networks may choose to use HTTP for their internal communication, but generally speaking you should be using HTTPS.\n\nIf you're using a certificate with the wrong name, you can have issues such as a browser warning, or perhaps being blocked by firewalls or other preventative systems. If it is indeed self signed, then you can just generate a new certificate and be done with it (although there will still be a browser warning for self signed certs).",

If the router enforces them, and it applies controls to a device with a particular IP address, then the device can be configured to manually acquire a different IP address, bypassing the assigned address and thus the controls.\n\nAny suggestions for more secure or effective methods to enforce these controls.\n\nUse a more advanced network gateway that applies the parental controls to all devices on the network, except for specific allowed devices. That exception can be applied based on IP address or MAC address (easier), or logins or client keys (more difficult to manage). This is more secure than targeting the controls to a specific device, because no matter how you apply the restriction there is usually some way to make the device look like a different device that won't be subject to the restrictions.\n\nThen, you physically confiscate any SIM card or other means of accessing internet outside of the protected WiFi network.\n\nYou can also use parental control software that restricts access to certain websites, but this is less reliable than blocking it at the network level. The one thing you have to understand in cybersecurity is, if you have unsupervised physical access to the device, you control the device, it cannot be trusted.\n\nGeneral advice on dealing with similar situations where a client might be technically adept at bypassing network restrictions.\n\nDon't 100% rely on technology. Nothing is foolproof if the attacker is skilled and dedicated enough. Any technological measure has to be supported by active surveillance.",

After that you can open and convert with any program that uses the windows image API.

I can 100% say that iMazing worked perfectly for me on my Windows 10 PC, and got me out of .HEIC hell a couple months ago. You can do a whole folder of pictures at a time - just select all of them in the relevant folder and then drag and drop them onto the converter.\n\nApple drives me insane a lot of the time. I use an old Samsung Galaxy S7 phone that still works great and am so used to just copying and pasting .jpg files. But I had to back up 1000s of photos from an iPhone recently, and almost all of them were .HEIC. And this was despite changing the iPhone's camera settings to default to JPEG.\n\nAs suggested here and elsewhere: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253171166?sortBy=best\n\nGo to Settings/Camera and change Format to Most Compatible. This will switch all images to JPG.\n\nDoing that might be worth a shot going forward on that phone. Changing this setting is supposed to make .JPEG the default format for photos you take. Though it only partially worked for me.\n\nBut anyways iMazing worked great for me.\n\nEDIT: Here's the link: https://imazing.com/converter",

Apple and a few others use it because HEIC produces smaller files for the same quality. If you would convert your whole collection to JPG, please be mindful of the fact the files will be larger and likely will lose some details after conversion. If you happen to try to keep your files the same size as they are now, your are losing quality (whether you can actually notice the difference easily is another matter, though).\n\nOne idea is to switch to better image viewing software (like XnView MP) for good and convert the files as-needed or create small thumbnails for comfortable viewing while keeping your HEIC files as the \"originals.\" If you would convert everything, please remember you're going to need up to 40% more storage space for your photos (if you plan to keep them) and even then you're likely still losing data, especially color information (your files won't lose all color or anything, but you'll lose things that are hard to notice at a glance).\n\nAlthough not ideal, HEIC is decades newer and easily technically superior to JPG. It's supported on Android and by many applications. Windows isn't very good with it out of the box, but the HEIC alternatives aren't that great either when it comes to software support.",

I'll try to see if there's any more software I can update / install, but I highly doubt it.

If this works, go to Lenovo support website to update BIOS to the latest\nPerform a power drain by unplugging the AC adapter and removing the battery. Hold the Power button down for at least 10 seconds. Install the battery, plug in the AC adapter, and try powering on the system\n\nhttps://www.bing.com/search?pglt=675&q=lenovo+backlight+keyboard+not+working&cvid=28cec7b904c54f27ad62839da24482bc&gs\\_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQABhAMgYIAhAAGEAyBggDEAAYQDIGCAQQABhAMgYIBRAAGEAyBggGEAAYQDIGCAcQABhAMgYICBBFGEDSAQkyMDAwNGowajGoAgCwAgA&FORM=ANNTA1&PC=ASTS&showconv=1",

By now, I've narrowed it down to a single possible cause: there's a small ribbon connector that controls the backlight that is not fully plugged in to the motherboard. From what I've seen, it's a pretty easy fix and should take no less than 10 minutes, but I'm afraid I'll void my warranty if I do that.",

So if I was setting up a new Laptop for department YYY, it would be something like \"LT-YYY-1-24-01\" and the \"1\" being the \"Nth\" laptop for that department.\n\nIt might end up changing hands at some point, they will eventually die and new ones will arrive, but knowing it was originally set up for department YYY and when would give some context and explain why department Z keep asking for standard (to them) software to be installed on it or whatever.\n\nIf you're the only one with hands-on stuff and doing lots of config stuff, you probably want to keep track of various stuff. How you do it is up to you, but I like to keep a document with each machine in it, and after changing something, I update the doc. Sometimes, I'd rather check the doc before the machine to give me some context, or maybe I need to copy some config or something.\n\nThings like credentials for IoT devices, static IP addresses, where the device belongs (the last I heard, anyways!), even stuff like the model number or whatever if I want to check out a manual or specs instead of actually digging out the machine out of production to get that info.",

Prefix it with an alpha so that the number doesn't get confused for something else, like \"IT\" or an abbreviation of the company name (like \"MS\" if you work at Microsoft). So like IT0001, IT0002 etc. Whatever your asset management system/CMDB supports, don't overcomplicate things. Print stickers you can stick onto the devices. Preferably with a barcode/QR code you can scan, maybe some text that indicates the company that owns it, and the phone number for IT service desk, in case of lost property etc.\n\nAbsolutely do not, as other comments recommend, use anything like the location/department, employee name or anything like that in the asset tag. Aside from the security and privacy issues, this is silly because assets will often change owner multiple times. Also don't use service tags or serial numbers assigned by the manufacturer, these aren't guaranteed to be globally unique, and certainly won't follow any consistent pattern, and not every type of asset will even have one.\n\nAlso don't try to be creative and do dumb shit like name servers after LOTR characters or whatever. The novelty wears off real quick and you're stuck with a nonsense system that won't scale.\n\nMost companies won't track commodity like headsets, keyboards etc or consumables. It's simply not worth the overhead to track 100x $5 keyboards or 500x $2 USB cables. Desktops, laptops, RUs, monitors, network devices etc only and whatever else management requires.",

        "comment": "Lastly if the ram is truly faulty, why the HELL the does the windows inbuilt tools detect no errors? like tf dude, it ran for two times and no issue was detected.\n\nMemory testers are not reliable with DDR4 and newer. And the Windows one is not great either.\n\nSo, I called the repair shop and they said they'll replace the ram with a Acer 4GB 2666MHZ ram. I also asked them maybe the issue is caused by compatibility. Because the inbuilt laptop has ram at 2133MHZ will it be compatible with 2666MHZ ram?\n\nYou don't get compatibility issues from different specs as it will just clock down to match the slowest stick. Where you get compatibility issues is if it's a different chipset (Not to be confused with motherboard chipset) and/or manufacturer of the RAM. The brand on the RAM doesn't make the sticks (Except for a few). All RAM chips and chipsets are made by SK Hynix, Samsung, Nanya or Micron/Spectec. The only ones I know of that sell memory directly is Samsung and Micron semi does it through Crucial.\n\nMatching the integrated stick is basically not going to happen so you just try a stick and cross your fingers. You can check who made the chips and which chipset the integrated RAM uses, but no one advertises (Or even list it in the specs) what their RAM uses so it's not searchable.",

As for full RAM consumption - the game uses full memory to precache as much resources as it can, which is an optimization method. It doesn't mean that you don't have enough memory. System reqs of BG3 is 8 gb of RAM, and it proves it by being run on Xbox Series S no problem (which is 8gb of shared memory - means both GPU and CPU use it, while you have dedicated VRAM memory in an NVIDIA card).\n\n>I'm sorry, for the second part, outside understanding you told me 2x16 instead of 4x8 I did not understand the rest.\n\nIf you're gonna overclock your RAM to something like 3600-3800 mhz and choose decent timings (push your RAM to the limit), you need 2x16 sticks. If not, 4x8 will be OK.\n\nBut let me say once again - I wouldn't upgrade memory in your sitch. 16gb is enough. Modern games are VRAM eaters, they do not need much sytem RAM - to the point where it's OK to have 16gb system RAM and a 16gb videocard like RTX 4080 (for games of course).",

Dump files are crash logs from BSODs.\n\nIf you can get into Windows normally or through Safe Mode could you check C:\\Windows\\Minidump for any dump files? If you have any dump files, copy the folder to the desktop, zip the folder and upload it. If you don't have any zip software installed, right click on the folder and select Send to → Compressed (Zipped) folder.\n\nUpload to any easy to use file sharing site. Reddit keeps blacklisting file hosts so find something that works, currently catbox.moe or mediafire.com seems to be working.\n\nWe like to have multiple dump files to work with so if you only have one dump file, none or not a folder at all, upload the ones you have and then follow this guide to change the dump type to Small Memory Dump. The \"Overwrite dump file\" option will be grayed out since small memory dumps never overwrite.\n\nI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns.",

Im right now on the search for new RAM modules that are compatible to my CPU and mobo and to try and get one of those to test.\n\nBut thatll take time and I really want to mitigate the risk of trashing the new RAM aswell with some underlying problem. Im wondering if the XMP clocks and voltages or the combination of CPU and mobo couldve somehow rekt my RAM.",
