What other assets are reachable by this asset?\n\n- What is the source of the vulnerability, and is that source in use in other places? Can I fix 100 instances of this vulnerability by fixing and redeploying one image?\n\n- Did the developer put a mitigation in place for this CVE already?\n\n- Does a fix for this CVE exist?\n\nThat's just a short list.

You start with the highest risk stuff and work your way down to the lowest risk. Sometimes there's super low hanging fruit that can take your stuff high to medium/low risk by just enabling settings in software you already have. For example enabling 2fa is a simple fix that can knock down the probability a point and in turn lower your overall risk.\n\nYou have to remember when doing these type of risk assessments is if everything is high risk then nothing is high risk so you have to be realistic.",

You can mention overlap between a lot of them and how you are familiar with the 110 controls ( this is public ) and definitely mention future CMMC V2 LVL 2 ( its the same thing but future state of NIST 800-171 )\n\n​\n\nFor me personally I have done ISO 27001 and NIST 800-171 but not 800-53. You can always arm yourself with information about one you haven't done and if that's not good enough for the employer then you did as much as you can for that instance. Don't give up :) I firmly believe a competent employer will recognize achievements and understand you may not have had to do all of them to be good at new ventures. Now if they hold NIST as their primary or only compliance ya they may care but still I would suggest to follow what I said above and others in the thread.\n\nIt is definitely hard right now, I am an IT Director and I have been out of work since July. things are super competitive right now and with everyone being dumped into the scene. Just have to keep at it :)\n\n​\n\nEDIT: havent done the NIST compliances above if you have any questions just ask. There is also just NIST CSF if you are interested in just the frameworks and not the actually 110 controls of 800-171.",

If you lie about anything or intentionally leave out anything major then it’s pretty much an automatic denial with no chance of appeal.\n\nDrug use, criminal history, debt, etc can all be forgiven as long as they aren’t recent, severe, or recurring problems. Connections to a foreign adversary are tricker and harder to overcome but it depends on the country and how connected you are. Big difference between having a 2nd cousin in China and having immigrated to the US from Russia 5 years ago.\n\nCriminal history and drug use are only problems if it was severe, went on for a long time, or is recent (ie in the last 5-10 years).\n\nAnd finally it depends on the level (confidential, secret, or Top Secret). In general Top Secret focuses on the last 10 years, Secret the last 5, and confidential the last 3 (those numbers may be off a little). It’s doesn’t mean everything that happened 11 years ago is off limits but in general they are interested in who you are and what you did in those time frames.\n\nFinally, there is an appeals process if you are denied. From my understanding, you will be denied for anything that might be a problem and it’s only on appeal that they look deeper - but you will likely have to hire a lawyer to guide you through that process if you are denied.\n\nOne big hurdle I forgot to mention is the Polygraph (lie detector) which is where they ask you questions mainly about if everything on your application is complete and truthful and the obvious things like “are you loyal to the US” and you can’t fail that. Most people who fail the poly only fail because they left something out or weren’t completely truthful - which makes them nervous so it shows up as lying and then your screwed, which is why the most important thing is to be honest because if you try to hide something it’s going to show up on the polygraph.\n\nOverall, it’s not so bad so try not to be too nervous. The fact is this: your either going to pass or fail based on things that already happened or your can’t change. If you have something in your past that’s problematic, you MIGHT fail but if you try to hide it then you WILL 100% fail and even if you do manage to hide something, odds are they will find out later and then it becomes much more serious.\n\nTLDR - just be honest. It’s a long process but it’s mostly just waiting around for a phone call. All you really do is fill out the application, go to an interview, and take a polygraph.",

Apply for the jobs that say “must be able to obtain security clearance.” Once you have the clearance you can transfer it over from job to job. If you get a job that doesn’t require the clearance, you will lose the clearance.\n\nNow the process to my knowledge on getting a security clearance is you apply for the job that says “must be able to obtain security clearance.”, they offer you an interview, you pass the interview and you get the job, they then ask you to fill out the SF-86. That’s the form you cannot lie on and it’s 86 questions all about yourself. Once that’s done, you after to put down a lot of references of people that are close to you. My buddy had to put down 20. You submit the form and references. Then the back ground check begins.\n\nThe company will call all the references you listed as they are seeing if they can trust you.

I was denied, then the owner went out and spent 500k on brand new vehicles for all upper management (replacing their 1 year old vehicles) so I started shopping around found a job with a 15-20% increase. Put in my two weeks. They offered to beat it. I liked the company so I opted to stay since my main gripe was being paid under market value. And now they were offering in market range. The next couple of months was awful. Constant chatter about how I was a bad employee, only wanted money. Upper management treated me like crap. They brought someone in for me to train. So I started shopping around again to get out. Put in my two weeks. They said they were willing to pay me more money, and would make it worth while for me to stay. Kept saying they were putting an offer together. Last day there they handed me an envelope with a .25c raise. And a promise of a $3 raise at the end of two more years. After I politely declined the owner of the company came over to tell me I was lazy for not wanted to work for him anymore and that's why I was changing to a gov position. Then said that there's no way he could compete with gov benefits/wages. Then said he will wait for me to come back.\n\nI was like yeah after those comments that's not happening.

And upper management (not my manager) didn't want to give me a big raise. Part was because they were a bunch of older guys that that didn't understand IT salaries and thought we were all entry level pay. But with a signed offer in hand they changed their mind (clearly they knew they couldn't lose me). And I've gone up from there in salary and position. It really helped that I had my manager as my strong advocate, he had already asked them for more money before this occurred. So I think my situation is very unique and won't be very common for everyone else.\n\nYou frame it like \" I really like working here and everything is going well, but I've got another offer I can't ignore.

Feel free to cast the blame on the prior manager (i.e., “I had brought this to X in the past, but feel they didn’t have the company or the success of our section/department in mind when they were here.”) If you think that won’t go over well, then ignore me on this, but you need to set expectations on what success in the next 3 months, 6 months, and year is going to look like.\n\nReiterate the positives: why do you like your role. You’re a great fit and enjoy the company culture, the executive team, et. al.\n\nPut a time limit on their response. You know this is something they will have to give consideration and obtain approvals for, but the offer you received has a timeline (shorter than the real timeline), so you will need a written agreement on the counter before then.\n\nI had the same situation several years ago and bumped up my income ~60% and have no regrets. My department grew from 3 to 8 since then and I am spending a lot more time doing the things I enjoy and excel at.\n\nThere’s always the chance they shove the salary at you and can you down the road, but from the sound of it that may be more trouble than it’s worth for them. I also had the benefit of getting along extremely well with my top-level supervisor, so YMMV.\n\nAll the same, best of luck OP. Let us know how it goes!",

        "comment": "Boy do I have a story for you.\n\nI’ve told this at a local conference before, but it’s probably worth writing down. This is the ballad of Jimbo, the man who probably purchased my debit card off of the internet.\n\nBack in undergrad (some 6-8 years ago), I was traveling quite a bit (once a semester) and noticed an unauthorized charge to a Kroger for a very even amount of money. Thinking not much of it, I called my bank, they yeeted the charge from my account, all was good.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nA couple days passed and I got a call from my mom (a few states away). She asked if there was anything I’d like to talk about and not to be ashamed of anything. Not knowing what she was talking about, and reacting as such, she described 2 packages that had arrived that day that were subscriptions to male bedroom supplements.\n\nWild.\n\nI asked her to read the phone numbers off of the packages and id call and get to the bottom of this. Some context here, I’d just come off of 9 months of internships doing incident response for a F500 where I gathered open and closed data for attribution and remediation, and another where I did open source research and social engineering on companies to validate their security structure.\n\nSo I called the first number and was told in very clear terms to “fuck off” and “we’re not fucking refunding you”. They weren’t nice, but they killed the charges at least.\n\nThe second company was much kinder. I explained the situation, was also told no refund but to cancel the order I had to validate the email. I gave them mine and was told the magical words “that’s not the email we have on file”.\n\nMe: Oh really? What email do you have on file?\n\nThem: “jimmy<lastname><birthyear>@<domain>”\n\nPhenomenal. We had a lead. I thanked them for their time (after having them spell the email) and immediately threw the email into a search engine. And was greeted with his voting record, confirming his birthday, email, and address.\n\nWe’re getting somewhere.\n\nI poked around a little bit before I had my required philosophy 202 class and went to class, not before telling my roommate (who had just come off of a very well known pen testing internship at a very very large company) what had happened. Clearly we both had the same idea that we had to find more about jimmy, and both went to class, where our other security friends were also. I briefed them, they found it hilarious, and we went to work.\n\nWe had a hard time googling, but I made a breakthrough on one of the Facebook scam sites that usually claim to have someone’s info but never do. This one, while it wanted money, brought up a picture that was a real Facebook asset. If you’re not familiar with meta assets, they organize all of them by user accounts as folders, and assets as items in the folders (so every asset will directly link back to the account). So using the asset, we now had a Facebook account, that we verified with the voting record. Which he named himself “Jimbo”\n\nJackpot.\n\nOver the next hour or so of our philosophy class, we found everything from his twitter, YouTube, Pokémon go, license plate (registered to the address we found), and all the same for his wife as well. Fully doxxed this poor guy.\n\nSo like any responsible citizen, I called my local non-emergency line to inform them someone was trying to complete fraudulent purchases in my name and swipe the packages from my porch to avoid any alarms (unfortunately thwarted by my retired parents) and gave them all the info we collected. They were stunned that I did this over 5 dollars, and told me there’s not a lot they could do.\n\nSo kind of an anti climatic ending of the jimbo ballad, but it does sum up how we doxxed a person because they ordered male bedroom supplements to my parents house. There is no moral, but we all had fun and got a cool story out of it (and a practical warning not to put things on the internet).\n\nHopefully this helps (or at least makes you or your professor laugh).",

Once that is complete you would need to reset passwords on all affected accounts (if it’s all accounts, roll it out by department or similar) while also revoking all access tokens the user has. This will effectively block any actors that already have attained access, and the password reset will sever the attackers persistence. Then, you must find how the identities were disclosed, whether it was a third party or your own infra that was compromised, or if a large phishing campaign fooled many users. Then you must fix this so others don’t have the same ability. Once you get hit once and have large data leaks, others will try thinking you’re an easy target.\n\nI’m sure others with a little more experience in this realm can add additional context, but this would be a basic incident response plan.",

I ask because I see this a lot, \"This vulnerability is not critical because its just some old app some people use\" But the server it is running on is often a domain member, or houses otherwise sensitive levels of access/data for other systems as well. So I always point out lateral movement; could the app be compromised, could that be used to further compromise the host, and can the host then be used to compromise the network?\n\nQuite often the vector is not the target, in fact I would say most often. And any legacy system running anything known vulnerable should be isolated until removed. I know that is not always possible, but it practical to target at least and keep regularly audited reasons for why not.\n\nI have had to get very crafty sometimes with systems that \"Have to stay\" but \"Cannot be upgraded, yet...\"\n\nI had a manufacturing facility that their ancient small package shipping solution would not take HTTPS as its web server was proprietary. Not only did it pass its own traffic in the clear, it logged ERP credentials in the clear as well. So if you nabbed that host, you had the full ERP system next move...\n\nI had to spin up a HaProxy instance and do proper TLS, ssh tunnel back to web host from the proxy host, and exit to 127.0.0.1, then bound the web server to that interface.\n\nClient -> Proxy was HTTPS, Secure... Proxy to Web server was SSH, Secure..

That isn't what severity is to be used for. More importantly, it will inevitably be the wrong decision, and something that didn't make the cutoff will bite you in the ass.\n\nThere is also the compliance angle. No framework let's you just not fix stuff. Some may allow you to deviate in specific circumstances (e.g. FedRAMP if a third-party vendor isn't fixing the issue) but otherwise they all just give you more or less time.\n\nInstead, use Stakeholder Specific Vulnerability Cateogorization (SSVC). It is something Carnegie Mellon's SEI put together (original whitepaper) and its what CISA uses to prioritize response (CISA's implementation, tailored for their mission).\n\nHaving used it for some time in a real-world setting, it's fantastic. Allows us to prioritize what's an emergency and what is not. You can even just adopt CISA's implementation and see a better response process, though everyone should really start with the whitepaper and tailor their decision tree to their business.\n\nAnyways, fix all the things. Use the maximal SLAs (120 days for low, 60 for medium, 30 for high, aim for 14 for critical) multiple compliance frameworks allow, the things that can't be done in those timeframes build a deviation process to manage and track, and then figure out what CVEs need to ignore all thst and go to immediate mitigation, and to what degree (are you temporarily impacting Ops to avoid a security incident or are you just making sure things are fixed ASAP)",

If an attacker gains access to both the encrypted 2FA secrets and the encryption keys, they could potentially decrypt the secrets and generate valid OTPs.

Traditional TOTP methods, which rely on a shared secret, are more common and easier to implement in many systems.\n\nRegarding the idea of using a password to encrypt the OTP seed, this indeed adds an additional layer of security. In this scenario, even if an attacker gains access to the encrypted 2FA secrets, they would still need the user's password to decrypt and use the seed. This method combines something the user knows (their password) with something the user has (their OTP seed), enhancing the security of the 2FA mechanism. However, this approach requires careful implementation to ensure that the password itself is not vulnerable to attacks, and it adds complexity to the authentication process.\n\nBoth of these methods are secure alternatives to the more traditional shared secret approach. The choice of method often depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the system, as well as the balance between security and usability.",

This is ideal for passwords, where the original password does not need to be known by the server. Encryption, on the other hand, is used when the original data needs to be retrieved, which is the case with 2FA secrets.

Additionally, as you noted, many people reuse passwords or use weak passwords, making it easier for attackers to exploit stolen data. The severity of a data breach depends on the nature of the data exposed and the security measures in place.

For 2FA secrets, they need to be decrypted to generate a valid OTP for each authentication attempt. This decryption is done in a highly secure and controlled environment within the server infrastructure. Advanced security measures, such as hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure enclaves, are often employed to store encryption keys and perform decryption operations. These secure environments are designed to resist tampering and unauthorized access, making it difficult for attackers to access the encryption keys or decrypted secrets, even if they have infiltrated the network.\n\nIn contrast, passwords, when hashed, do not need to be decrypted at all. The authentication process involves hashing the user-provided password and comparing it with the stored hash. This approach removes the need to revert the password to its original form, enhancing security. If passwords were stored in an encrypted form like 2FA secrets, it would introduce the additional risk of decryption keys being compromised, potentially exposing the original passwords.\n\nThe security of both systems, however, depends heavily on the implementation and management of encryption keys and secure storage. While both methods have their own strengths and vulnerabilities, they are designed to complement each other in a layered security approach. In the event of a data breach, it's always prudent to consider both the password and the 2FA secret compromised and take appropriate measures, such as changing passwords and reconfiguring 2FA settings.",

Significantly longer than a password. The shared secret is randomly generated and assigned to the authentication device and never changed. But by RFC the authenticator device must be resistant to tampering. In most cases this means that attempts to tamper will zero the secret. The server you are logging into is not the authenticator and doesn’t not hold the secret. The authenticator must be hardened and protected from compromise. But since it only communicates with the servers using a specific protocol it can be much more difficult to compromise. In a proper implementation the secret is stored in an HSM and values are generated by the HSM on behalf of the authenticator. The valid number for authentication is algorithmically generated based on the secret and a synchronized value between the authenticator and the device.\n\nBy capturing many authentication sessions in plaintext it may be possible to derive the algorithm and create a brute force attack, but this should by standard be more difficult than performing a brute force attack on a password. And by standard, the authenticator should block repeated failed requests.\n\nThe shared secret is supposed to be stored encrypted, decrypted for use, protected in memory, then wiped from memory after use. It is never sent in the transaction.\n\nOTP has its limitations, but it protects against replay attacks.\n\nThere have been cases where the initial seed for the authenticator were discovered which have allowed for the compromise of the tokens.

E.g. all hashed passwords can be stored on a separate hardened 'authenticator' in its HSM which only communicates with the server in a very specific protocol, and it's wiped from memory immediately etc. And if they are already, then how do breaches of hashed passwords happen? Or are you saying that passwords are/should be stored like this too - it's just that whenever there's a breach, it's because companies haven't used the latest standards/practices?\n\nEssentially, is there a fundamental difference between storing a hashed password and storing a 2fa secret?",

This is exactly what I was trying to articulate. In a way, I don't really need to know the nitty gritty of how they are encrypted or securely stored, but I just wanted acknowledgement (or an explanation of why not) of the fact that if a data breach can expose a hashed password, surely the same data breach could expose a 2fa secre. Because a 2fa secret can't be stored more securely than a hashed password (because if it could be, you'd match the security of the hashed passwords by making it the same method as the 2fa secret keys - proof by contradiction). and yet hashed passwords get exposed in data breaches so why not 2fa secret keys? For whatever reason we worry about hashed passwords being leaked, we should be worried even more about 2fa secrets being leaked because the additional step of trying to guess the original password doesn't exist with 2fa secret keys - a TOTP can be generated immediately.\n\nAnother user made me realise:\n* Passwords are vulnerable to being intercepted in plain text form via network transport, but are resistant to infrastructure/data breaches because they are stored in hashed and salted form. * TOTP-based authentication is resistant to being intercepted via network transport because the actual secret key is never sent in transport, only an OTP derived from it which changes every 30sec or so. However it is vulnerable to being exposed in an infrastructure/data breach (as I think people are confirming in this post here).\n\nSo together they are great, and this reassures me a lot. Someone can't gain access by a single breach of the server, or a single breach of your private network - because with a breach of the server database the 2fa secrets can be known but your original password can't be, and with a breach of your client-side network the password can be known but not the 2fa secret key.",

You just implement what they say to, and always stand ground on how much a thing will take. I've seen people over promise and burn out as well.\n\nLast point I will make, don't be a dick. Seriously, don't. Being tech literate is good, but you won't get a job being great if you are nightmare to work with. Seriously. I've worked with too many people like this. Always assume everyone knows little about tech and you are there to educate, like a parent or teacher. Not to talk down to someone.",

I was just doing regular help desk at a different company and started interviewing everywhere I could, just sort of happened to get my gig now.\n\nDon’t be afraid to start at help desk, if you’re at a good one, it really is the best place to get your hands on everything. Take on as many wacky projects as you can and take all the work others avoid. I just worked on my home network, built a separate server, bought a domain, set up a reverse proxy and secured it just to try it.\n\nIn my interview I focused on the fundamentals, let them know what I had tried in my spare time, told them about certs(was finishing WGU at the time, but only had A+ and the beginner AWS cert), and most importantly, told them what I definitely knew and what I definitely DID NOT know and was extremely honest. I let them know my ambitions, had a 10 year plan, and they called me the next day with an offer. My boss told me they picked me over a more experienced applicant due to the interview.\n\nA lot of it is luck, but apply for EVERYTHING!!! Best job I’ve ever had and I was so unqualified for it, I almost skipped the interview. My wife convinced me in the morning to do it and said “At least you’d get interview experience, you never know!”",

Instead, they spy on you without explicit consent, as their terms of service are often purposefully lengthy and written in language that may not be easily understood by consumers and customers. Today, hardly anyone reads terms of service. While the fault may partly lie with the user, advertising products as secure and private while misusing your data and collecting information about your activities with their devices can be considered spying. This is not the traditional spying we're used to, but in this day and age, it is still spying. John Oliver expressed this when he interviewed Edward Snowden. He showed that while technicalities might not concern the average person, framing the issue in terms of personal privacy, such as the question of whether someone would consent to having their \"dick pics\" viewed by others, resonates more and draws significant concern. (Source)\n\nI recall the buzz around the Patriot Act and Snowden's witty comment about renaming it to something like the \"Save Puppies Act.\" This was in response to Joe suggesting that such bills should be named more transparently, like \"bill whatever number,\" rather than misleadingly patriotic titles. (Source) But it seems that even with such laws, complete prevention of all surveillance activities is a challenge; this holds true even if we were granted \"netizen rights.\" When William Binney, a former intelligence official, was asked about the changes in intelligence communities before and after the Patriot Act and his views on Executive Order 12333, he responded:\n\nThe difference is that they tried to legitimize what they were doing in terms of mass collection. It didn't make any difference in the sense that they kept doing what they were already doing.\n\nThe mass collection is justified under EO 12333 section 23C. Read that section, and you will see that they are using that, and their own internal interpretation of that, which is not the same as the Congress's, and that's how they justify mass collection of everybody.\n\nedit: It's all done on the \"Upstream\" program, which has about a hundred tapping points inside the US.\n\n2nd edit: Google \"NSA fairview\" (ATT tapping points) and \"NSA stormbrew\" (Verizon tap points)\n\n(Source)\n\nSpeaking of interpretations, given the government's history of twisted legal interpretations, this language can't be relied on to protect our freedoms. (Source)\n\nRelevant:\n\nGoogle location data tracking saw innocent cyclist become key suspect in burglary\n\nAs someone aptly said:\n\nCriticism of any of the usual suspects can all be lumped together under one topic. There isn't any distinction between Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google right now; they all work for the Five Eyes, they share the data they STEAL with each other.\n\nWhy the fuck do people continue to apologize for these corporate crooks?\n\n(Source)",

This is an often-overlooked aspect, as it lays the groundwork for the creation of fraudulent data and services. In essence, these companies can generate and sell deceptive information while simultaneously earning revenue.\n\nAnother aspect often overlooked by consumers and customers is that sellers of these products or services may fabricate a problem for you, compelling you to purchase their solution for a non-existent issue. This tactic involves creating a perceived need where none actually exists, driving demand for their offerings by exploiting consumer fears or uncertainties.",

Also, if you develop software either for internal use only or for sale to customers supply chain attacks (think CI/CD pipeline and SDLC type stuff) could be a major factor as well.\n\nIMO, we need a little more context of what the company does or we are really just shooting in the dark here.

If you’re using hash, is it legitimately bad or does it have behaviors that make it suspicious?\n\nYour AV should be detecting things and automatically remediating them based on severity. It should also provide a signature that you can search to see why it hit.\n\nIf you mean files are getting detected and you’re verifying they’re not false positives, hashes, names, and signatures are a good place to start.\n\nRunning a sample through a sandbox also wouldn’t be bad a bad idea to better understand the behavior if you have a private account.\n\nAs far as, do you know anywhere that does that? Not really. You’ll see some websites will have a run down on the malware, but I like to look at hybrid analysis reports and provide details on what’s actually happening when the malware is executed. The websites I mentioned aren’t always accurate and will have false positives all the time, “svchost.exe isn’t necessary for most systems. Here’s how you delete it from your system”\n\nBut yeah, i normally do hashes —> behavior —> names. Names don’t always mean much but lazy threat actors won’t bother renaming a lot of the time.",
