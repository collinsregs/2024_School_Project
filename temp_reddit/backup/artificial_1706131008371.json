There are multiple AI fields that are fit for different use cases, so you should learn about them first and decide which fits best for you. And there are also multiple solutions that at different levels of abstraction and difficulty.\n\nYou have a few options to consider. Here's a non-exhaustive list of options going from easy to difficult:\n\nUsing APIs like OpenAI APIs. By far the easiest option of all.\nUsing fully managed solutions from cloud providers like AWS or Azure that use ML under the hood but don't expose all its complexity\nUsing managed ML environments from cloud providers or other platforms to run existing models, e.g. models from HuggingFace and fine-tune foundational models (e.g. from cloud provider or HuggingFace)\nWorking locally with tiny opensource models (so no cloud compute and associated skills necessary)\nActually training a new model from scratch, which requires a lot more fundamental knowledge than any of the options above and a sizable budget to spend on compute\n\nI think this visual introduction to machine learning is good to build an intuition: A visual introduction to machine learning (r2d3.us)\n\nFor reinforcement learning, there are additional considerations to take, but you're not going to get there so fast anyway. If you're a masochist and want to go into this right now anyway, you should also eventually learn about deep reinforcement learning, a combination of RL and DL for which OpenAI has set up a decent site: Introduction ‚Äî Spinning Up documentation (openai.com)\n\nA tip: never buy courses that teach you \"AI\". You can't teach AI holistically. The course should always be about a specific field/subset/area of AI.",

Yes, the numerical methods for linear and non-linear solvers are very similar to the error correcting solvers used in AI. The reason for this is probably because they are both PDE solvers. When we're doing backpropagation, we're applying a PDE that relates the error of the prediction back to the input coefficients/variables.\n\nOf course there are analogues between biology and the \"neirons\" of AI--so maybe there is additional overlap there as well.\n\nI used AI at one point to find relationships or rather to be able to predict certain specific medical diagnosis based on blood sample data (sounds like bioinformatics to me).

I guess he thought most AI researchers believed they could build a more intelligent machine than God could, and had ego problems as a result. Strange. Neither of those assumptions apply to me, so I don't think they are very logical assumptions since I don't believe they are generally true.\n\nI read the book \"Future Shock\" years ago. It predicted there will be many people who can't cope with the accelerated pace of science and technology, so society will need to establish enclaves for them, like in \"The Truman Show\" or \"The Village\" (2004) so that people can live in simpler 1950s type worlds with limited contact with the outside world, which wants to move ahead. Such enclaves sound fun and relaxing to me, actually, so I'm not criticizing them, but ultimately I want to advance as much as I can, so I don't fit in the old world very well.",

We already have Amish communities, Mennonite communities, Buddhist monasteries, and places similar to that where people live with limited technology where they refuse assimilation of technologies beyond some (completely arbitrary) chosen level of complexity. I could certainly see a future where communities are created that are similarly insular and disconnected but which accept a different level of technology as plausible.\n\nI think a more likely breaking-off-point would be 1980, with rejection of computers and especially the Internet and smartphones. It is difficult to imagine a cohesive antiquated worldview which nonetheless integrates near instantaneous global communication. We probably should expect something like that at some point. The Amish and others settled for the Agrarian Age and rejected the Industrial Age for the most part, it seems only reasonable that some people will accept the Industrial Age but refuse to partake of the Information Age.\n\nThese sorts of transitions, between different 'ages' of human history, always take a long time and change far, far more about human society than anyone is likely to appreciate except in hindsight. Industrialization, for example, changed how people marry, how homes were made (introducing private bedrooms in order to prevent children from understanding sex to reduce incidence of adolescent factory workers producing babies they could not afford to feed), our ideas of economics, government, city planning, community... just everything, really. All of it is up in the air now and has been since around 1980. Where it is going is probably still impossible to predict at this point, but one thing is certain: some people are not going to be happy with the changes to come.",

Then there would always be people trying to enlighten the community, amaze them, and bring them up to speed, as we see with people showing off mirrors or photographs to primitive tribes, or people parachuting into Truman's world to let him know he's being deluded. An old person in a retirement home who lives inside all the time might be able to succeed in believing the world has not advanced to an uncomfortably advanced state, but most people like to travel and to go outside.\n\nProbably Amish type communities are the best solution, where those people are aware of modern society, but simply reject it.",

Compare that to faces, which are often facing towards the viewer and two eyes, one nose, and a mouth are clearly visible - it has an easier time because faces are often similar in images. Words are also very variable, with so many different combinations of letters that can be in text, so it creates a jumble of shapes that are text-like, but not real words.",
