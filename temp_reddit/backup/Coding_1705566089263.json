        "comment": "Simplified Synopsis:\n\nPlotteus is an open-source JavaScript library designed for data storytelling. It allows full control over animations, enabling more natural and engaging data-driven stories. The library supports seamless transitions between different chart types and elements, including colors. It includes six chart types like bar, bubble, and scatter, and offers features like config-based operation, grouping support, and theme adaptability to any background color. The focus is on empowering the audience to interact with the data at their own pace, making stories more memorable.\n\nIf you don't like the summary, just downvote and I'll try to delete the comment eventually üëç",

        "comment": "Elevator pitch version:\n\nThe post challenges the popular belief that static types significantly reduce bug density in software development. It references studies showing the limited impact of static types on bug reduction, compared to the more substantial benefits of Test Driven Development (TDD). The post also argues that while static types offer certain developer tools and can be useful, they provide a false sense of security regarding bug prevention. It concludes by advocating for TDD as a more effective method for reducing bugs while recognizing the ancillary benefits of static types. NOTE: This is not related to the actual summary, but this shows more that types have an effect on the wider programming market than an effect on a highly proficient team. So if you have control of the hiring, go for TDD and hire those skills, if you don't, typescript will probably be a great plumbing tape to get delivery going.\n\nIf you don't like the summary, just downvote and I'll try to delete the comment eventually üëç",

Oxlint is designed to be faster and more efficient than ESLint, capable of running on large codebases in seconds. It focuses on identifying problematic code without the need for extensive configurations. The post highlights Oxlint's significant speed advantage, demonstrated by its rapid linting of Shopify's codebase. Oxlint aims for ease of use with zero-config setup, leveraging Rust and parallel processing for performance. It prioritizes identifying erroneous or redundant code, and simplifies understanding lint messages. The post also notes ongoing work to read from ESLint configurations and considers future plugin system possibilities.\n\nIf you don't like the summary, just downvote and I'll try to delete the comment eventually üëç",

I know it by reputation, but haven't used one. But I believe you would write the programs on a PC, hook it up via USB to transfer a program to it. So there's the implicit requirement of having some kind of computer available.\n\nSomeone else mentioned Raspberry Pi's. Most of those are actually full computers on their own, with USB, HDMI, and network connectors. You typically run Linux on them. Education was one of the original missions, so there should be a lot of material out there targeting that, along with a lot of use by hobbyists. They've been around for about 13 years now, with a range of different models and prices (everything from a $4 microcontroller to a $100 computer built into a keyboard that includes everything but the screen).",
