Most will be prescribed the watch by their medical professional.\n\nRegular consumers will just buy an Apple Watch since the ecosystem is huge and there aren‚Äôt monthly fees to make sure you‚Äôre not dead.\n\nAs to why they are considered patent trolls - up until now their company has relied on medical devices sold to medical professionals that are used on site (think hospital or inpatient clinics) or get sold to patients / loaned out to patients.\n\nThey also seemed to refuse to work with Apple to license the technology for all long time.\n\nNow all of a sudden in 2022 they come out with a wearble consumer product (a watch) that looks almost like an Apple Watch. They are trying to cash in on Apple‚Äôs prior success in the watch market and using their patent to wage war. To some people they might seem ungrateful since they are literally standing on the shoulders of giants. But all is fair in love and war so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nFinally, it might seem as a power play that just hurts consumers some of which might need the technology for health reasons. I think it‚Äôs fair to say that Masimo is unlikely to gain a significant market share in the smartwatch field so they are just holding onto a potentially life saving technology just because. If you already have an Aaple Watch or any other smartwatch and you get told that you need this sensor it‚Äôs very unlikely that you‚Äôre gonna ditch your smartwatch and switch platforms. What will most likely happen is that they will be wearing two watches and you can imagine how annoyed people would be by this? You mean some silly patent war is making me get a separate device instead of just working with other manufacturers?\n\nThey have to be very careful though because their design will likely toe the line on Apple‚Äôs Watch patents. The second that Apple believes they have infringed they will come down on Masimo to bar the sale of their watches.\n\nFor better or for worse Apple tends to hold grudges and they like their retribution.",

            "comment": "Nobody can really say. At the moment, the judgment prevents Apple from importing new watches into the US or selling existing ones, but doesn't affect already sold ones.\n\nIn order to get around the judgment, Apple may try to remove the functionality via a software update. It isn't entirely clear to me that this would actually resolve the issue - if the patent claims are method claims, it would be fine, but if they're capability apparatus claims, that may not be enough. Either way, it's easier for Apple to pull it from everybody with those watches than figure out what was already sold. They might not even care for watch type if it's a monolithic update",

This would lock the owner out from using their apple account to try to recover or report stolen the phone.\n\nWorse yet. They would gain access to the users bank accounts, brokerage accounts, etc.\n\nThey would then transfer the users money into an account where it would go into crypto, and be stolen forever.\n\nI believe the journal did a podcast on it, where some girl lost tens of thousands from her phone being stolen.

What the article is saying is that Apple is going to use QLC (‚ÄúQuad-level cell‚Äù): using a cell to store 4 bits of data.\n\nReprising the wooden floor analogy, this is the equivalent of stacking 4 boxes on one spot on the floor, making the floor wear down/scuff faster‚Äî ie decreasing the lifespan/‚Äúwrite endurance‚Äù.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt a huge issue nowadays, but it depends on how good a controller is attached to the SSD. A controller is kinda like a warehouse foreman who will tell the workers not to keep using the same convenient spots and to haul stuff evenly across all the spots on the floor, to make the wear even. Now, even a good foreman can‚Äôt do their job perfectly‚Äî which is why sometimes they tell the workers to put the boxes in a worn down spot. Not a huge issue with 1 box or maybe 3, but stakes are higher when you‚Äôre stacking 4 boxes tall; the errors add up and add up fast. And if you tell workers to put boxes in an already really scuffed up place‚Äî the boxes can fall through the floor and get lost.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Apple will use or develop a good controller to mitigate these issues. But theoretically, you won‚Äôt hit the scuff limit on a mobile phone with normal use.",

Charges are stored in little cells, and while it is easy to read how much charge is inside, it is difficult to change the amount of charge because you basically have to shove electrons through a solid cell wall they don't want to go through. If you made the wall weaker, the memory wouldn't be stable. So by forcing them through the wall when you want to change the charge, you damage the wall a little each time. Eventually you damage it so much that you crack it and electrons leak out.\n\nBy moving to different technologies, you may have either a weaker wall relative to the energy required to change the charge, or may need to change more cells more frequently, either of which causes the wall to break faster.",

Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[6][7] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.",
