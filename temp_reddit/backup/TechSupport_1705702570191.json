Generally, it gives meaning, but I've never actually noticed that those pictures have some descriptions and I tried to google this problem and didn't find any answer to or topic about it. I was really scared when I saw this Chinese sentence on my screen and even more when I translated it.\n\n​\n\nEdit: Yes, when I use 'unknown language' instead of 'Chinese language' in my phrase I can see there are some answers to that.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThank You!",

If replicable, try using a third-party camera app to isolate if the problem is with the camera app specifically, or the OS/hardware instead. If it also bugging on the third-party camera app, reboot in safe mode (hold volume down while rebooting) and try again with the stock camera app. If it works fine in safe mode, try clearing the camera app data and boot back to normal mode (just reboot without holding the volume button), if it still breaks, you might wanna try a factory reset, which if still fails means you need to bring it to repair center.",

Also what did you do to clone it?\n\nBy the way, temporarily disabling device encryption does NOT decrypt the drive. It keeps the encryption and leaves the keys behind, but the drive’s encryption and (likely in your case) TPM demands are probably still the same. In other words it wont protect you from setup issues since the encrypted structure is still the same. If you’re worried about bitlocker nonsense causing a problem you should always fully remove the encryption first.\n\nBy the way you really shouldn’t use TPM bitlocker on a computer that you’ll frequently change the hardware on. The TPM will frequently panic and demand the recovery key. Setting Bitlocker to no-TPM password-on-boot mode and enabling autologin is arguably more secure, and also won’t shit itself on hardware changes. You can change bitlocker to “require password, don’t use TPM” mode in the group policy editor, and microsoft provides tools for the autologin on their site",

Dump files are crash logs from BSODs.\n\nIf you can get into Windows normally or through Safe Mode could you check C:\\Windows\\Minidump for any dump files? If you have any dump files, copy the folder to the desktop, zip the folder and upload it. If you don't have any zip software installed, right click on the folder and select Send to → Compressed (Zipped) folder.\n\nUpload to any easy to use file sharing site. Reddit keeps blacklisting file hosts so find something that works, currently catbox.moe or mediafire.com seems to be working.\n\nWe like to have multiple dump files to work with so if you only have one dump file, none or not a folder at all, upload the ones you have and then follow this guide to change the dump type to Small Memory Dump.

If you go to task manager and select view more, one of the tabs will give you a layout of what your current RAM size is, what speed it operates at and how many slots you have available.\n\nThen it's a matter of checking what speed your processor and motherboard in the computer can handle. Looking up the info you provided gives several processors and different RAM configurations. We would need to know what your actual processor and chipset is in the computer, if you look up the processor model you can usually get the acceptable Ram speeds that it accepts.\n\nTypically it's best to match the mHz of the current RAM in the system, simply because your RAM for example will end up clocking down to match what your system can actually handle in this case. So if your computer can only handle 4800mHz, but you pay more money for 5600mHz, then you've paid for 800mHz your computer isn't using.\n\nAlso have to make sure that you are following the rules on single or dual channel RAM. For example of the system only has a single RAM slot and you buy dual channel RAM sticks, you'll only be able to use one of the sticks, and still be stuck at 16GB. It seems like most computers have dual channel but always the case)",

Get a laptop cooling pad with fans if possible.\n\nDo not let it run hot, heat is the enemy. So let it cool down from time to time. Buy laptop cooling pads if possible or at least make sure that there is sufficient airflow for the laptop to prevent heating.\n\nAvoid mechanical stresses like drops, jerks, vibrations etc.\n\nRegardless, you might have to replace components like battery, charger, and thermal paste once a few years cause that is how they work. Have fun with your new laptop.",

Consumer routers don't capture your device activity like you think they do. They could see your WiFi password but that's about it really\n\nWill they be able to see all my wifi activity?\n\nYes, though they won't be able to see your exact websites or what you are using or any of the data stored on your pc. Not on consumer routers. They can just see what device is connected and how much traffic is going to it.\n\nOr install things to track/acquire sensitive information?\n\nWhat router model? Almost consumer ones are locked down so they can't install anything on there. They can't install stuff on your devices from the router if that's what you are worried about\n\nThey won't have access to your pc and almost all websites are encrypted, so a consumer router can't decrypt that.\n\nWhat can I do to protect myself now after the fact besides changing my router password?\n\nThat's it. If they can't get into your router then you're good. For good measure I would factory reset it but not really required, just to undo any settings they changed (not related to hacking or privacy)",

It depends entirely on the skill and motive of the onsite tech. Is there any safeguard after the fact besides changing your password? Well, you could unplug your router.\n\nSeriously, though. If you have reason to believe the tech had bad intentions, then you need a different tech. If it were me, I'd log into the router, make sure admin access is restricted to the LAN subnet only (no admin access from the internet), make sure there are no ports configured to accept inbound traffic (check NAT/ PAT rules), then change both the wifi and admin access passwords. That and do a quick look at the Ethernet ports to make sure there are no new pieces of unfamiliar hardware.\n\nOf course all this would be moot if they installed some rogue software onto any of your computers, so if they sat at your keyboard and you didn't trust them then you should also run an application level security scan/ audit.",

Your pc is getting to hot.\n\n4th solution\n\nMaybe you have a spare video card that may fit in your pc try to put this video card in your pc then install the video card and then run the game.\n\n5th solution\n\nTry to measure the outputs from the PC powersupply if you know how to. Maybe the pc doesn't get enough power.\n\n6th solution\n\nOpen the case and remove all dust with air cleaner. Don't use water or vacuum cleaner.

These roms are super clean and get rid of a ton of bloatware and xiaomi ads.\n\n2.Download YouTube reVanced.\n\n3.Download Adaway on FDroid or their official github page. One version needs root (that's the one I use) the other one I'm not so sure how it works. You could consider using this as a free alternative to AdGuard if the nonroot version works well.\n\nSimpler version:\n\n1.Download AdGuard (paid app)\n\nDownload GrayJay for YouTube and other content too. The app is paid on Google play but you can use it for free on their website.\n\nAlso for android, download Firefox on android and install the uBlock extension there too.\n\nEdit: for Spotify on Android give xManager a try.\n\nGeneral: If you have a raspberry Pi you could run Pi-hole on it.\n\nAs for your TV I don't really know how I would block those... If it's an android TV you could try to enable ADB and delete from bloatware. Other than that and the Pi option, I don't have any ideas.\n\nI don't know how comfortable you feel messing around with your devices so if you need me to clear something up let me know.

This can be expanded outside the server, through a self-hosted VPN on the corp, so any computer anywhere can have access to the internal network after logging in to the VPN. Usually, the VPN authentication is linked to the roaming authentication, ie, two people can use the same PC at different times, just like the terminal in the facility.\n\nHowever, roaming user profiles are just that, profiles, it's not too different from when you're loading a cloud-saved game, the actual game processing is still done on your PC. In your current Google Meet setup, someone with just an Android tablet can run any app supported by the physical computer (I'm assuming Windows) even though Android can't run Windows apps easily. The app they're running might require large storage, fussy to set, or contain confidential data which while the company is fine with being seen through remote meetings, probably doesn't want for the remote scribe to have right in their own PC. It is possible to have a VM running on the server without using a separate physical PC, but configuring that isn't easy and you mentioned Google Meet, which may require some GPU which isn't really great for such VM setups. Windows licensing is a bit opaque too so I won't be surprised if it's cheaper to dedicate an existing desk with a PC rather than purchasing the terminal license.",

If nothing is going to happen, I don't see a reason to format it? but I don't know if not formatting it is going to do anything or not.\n\nI'm trying to figure out if anything IS going to happen if I just leave it? like does plugging it in and out damage it or the files?\nIf it says there's a problem why do the files work?\nI don't really understand USBS so sorry if my questions are dumb as mud.\n\nI don't really know what to copy off of it or if its worthy copying the entire USb because i might just copy the few folders I think are important and just leave the rest to whatever fate the PC god has for it.\n\nI'm kinda trying to figure out what happens if I do that lmfao.

They can be eDP or LVDS, to connect that to a regular PC or video card requires a scaler board.\n\nThese three parts combined (panel, scaler, PSU) are basically the cost of the monitor, the cost of the housing, especially on cheaper monitors without nice stands, is negligible. Doing this only makes sense if you can control the panels directly without a scaler, for instance from eDP video source(s).\n\nAnother problem is these raw panels have much lower QC guarantees than normal boxed monitors.

Even professional data recovery is very bad at recovering data from SSDs (rumor is 10% success rate). With flash storage you absolutely need backups, there's no fallback on data recovery. Data recovery from SSDs only works if there's some issue with the power circuitry they can manage to fix, or some controller problems can be solved with the appropriate knowledge of how the drive works. If there's a problem with the flash chips then it's over, there will be a big hole in all of your data.",

This in fact isn't anything to be concerned about, many drive models always do this. The dent and the inability to read the data is the problem.\n\nDoes it still make (soft) clicking sounds?

Ideally it should also match with the DHCP ranges, otherwise devices won't be able to connect.\n\nSubnet mask is less important, but again your subnet mask should ideally match your DHCP range. And the mask should ensure that it stays within the bounds of the private address space.\n\nHopefully your router prevents you from setting invalid configuration, but that's not guaranteed. Misconfiguration could result in a broken network at best (eg. failure to assign IPs, failure to communicate with router, failure to communicate with other LAN devices, failure to connect to internet), or worse a highly insecure local network.",

At this point you've got lots of options, but the easiest would be to use the OEM recovery where you boot into recovery mode and reset the device before it loads Windows.

Problem here is you might face activation issues.\n\nThird option would be to use the manufacturer's OS Recovery tool; like Dell has a utility where you pop in the serial number of the device and it will download and create a USB stick that will restore the thing to complete factory configuration. Upside is no activation worries, downside is it might have some bloat software from the manufacturer pre installed.\n\nFourth options would be to create a password reset boot disc, a multi tool disc like Medicat or Hiren's for example, or a dedicated util (there are dozens of these)\n\nFifth option is the old boot off a Win10 install media, then hack around with replacing utilman.exe with a copy of cmd.exe and abusing the accessibility icon to create an elevated command prompt; from there you can create a local administrator account you can use to then reset the PC.",

Otherwise you need to connect three cable each laptop.\n\nIf you got other question feel free to discuss with me. I am too boring right now haha",

It's not as fast or reliable as Ethernet, but usually better than WiFi. But not every home has wiring that will work with Powerline adapters.\n\nAnother option is mesh WiFi. WiFi 7 has just been released. Hardware will be super expensive, but you said you wanted the best so that's unavoidable. Depending on how far your room is from the Starlink gateway, you might need multiple mesh nodes to cover the distance. Latency will be terrible, but hey you're using Starlink so it already sucks anyway.\n\nThe last option is to get multiple WiFi access points (aka WiFi extenders). It'll be like mesh WiFi, but a hundred times worse.",

There shouldn't be any problem just buying a single static IP for a business line instead of a /29 block.\n\nIf you want to use multiple, you need to use equipment that supports that. Most modems/routers won't support it, which may include the Telus Network Access Hub. That may be why the technician mentioned setting the hub into bridge mode and using a separate router, so you could use a router that supports multiple WAN addresses; or to plug multiple routers into the switch, each of which will obtain their own public IP address (you would give Telus the MAC address of each router to allocate a different public IP to).\n\nBut if you want just one static IP, it would be assigned to the MAC address of the Telus hub, which you would use as the gateway router (ie. not in bridge mode) with no other routers on the network. Whether Telus requires any configuration on the hub to set the static IP, or they can do it all from their end, is up to their support team to guide you. You then use regular NAT to assign private IPs to other devices in the LAN. Even if your ISP assigned you a /29 block, you don't have to use them.",

        "comment": "Computer security is like an ogre; it has layers.\n\nForwarding a port is peeling away one of those layers.\n\nGenerally, port forwarding itself isn't that risky. It's what service you have running that's listening to that port that presents a risk. If nothing is listening, nothing can happen, other than maybe a little probing. If an insecure software is running, any vulnerabilities it has can potentially be exploited. Do you trust Minecraft to not have any security flaws? I wouldn't. Especially if you haven't taken any steps to prevent unwanted users joining your server. That's not really \"hacking\", that's just someone probing for public open Minecraft servers and stumbling across yours.\n\nNow the possibility of getting hacked and actually getting hacked are two different things. Some files increasing in size aren't particularly indicative of anything. They could be game files that grew after a game update. Or world save files that grew after you played the game and did stuff within the world. Or some kind of cache files that are only created after play. Impossible to say since you haven't specified exactly which files were bigger.\n\nIf you value your cyber security and have the means, a personal VPN like ZeroTier is certainly good protection - adding layers of security to compensate for the ones you've removed. Otherwise, if you trust in the security of Minecraft like thousands of other people do every day, and just want to stop other people logging into your server, there are simpler ways to do that.",

Ive checked when they joined server and the rest. There's not a single command written on the server besides their ip adress showing when they joined and text mesagges but they simply changed their username to mine and pretented its me. (I was not on the server yet they found my name and do not have any ingame priviledges yet they were flying and invisible). I was falling from a high place when I rejoined the world. They just trolled this guy going invisible, did not break anything in the world besides throwing my items to him and writing weird messages in chat\n\nZeroTier connects multiple devices. You can auth or block them on a browser interface and lets others in the network join games as if its a local network. So there's no need for port to be open. I just used port forwarding because hamachi was having constant disconnects and I had failed opening up a port in the past due to previous weird router interfaces. Couldnt use whitelist since kids dont have any premium accounts.\n\nIm gonna be watching the system I guess 🤷‍♂️ Its mainly used for work and has about 4 gigs of space full so I cant apply a fresh install right away.",

So I would reset the CMOS (The CMOS saves the BIOS settings so this gets you back to factory defaults) to get the iGPU active again, remove everything except one stick of RAM, the CPU, coolers and power cables. So remove the GPU and other PCIe devices, all storage and all RAM except one stick. Disconnect all USB except keyboard and mouse. Check the manual for the motherboard, but you usually want to use the second RAM slot when counting from the CPU socket. Same issue, try a different stick of RAM.\n\nIf it shows the BIOS, connect one piece of hardware at a time until the issue happens again (Or it might work again for some reason). Remember to remove the power from the PSU by disconnecting the wall power cable.\n\nIf you still have the same issue, it's the PSU, CPU or motherboard.",

While I agree 1Gbps is great for the average person, I have many things going on my network. I typically use many TB of data each month. I have a plex server running, torrents running, multiple tvs streaming 4k, multiple smart devices and about 8 -10 pc/laptops/streaming devices ( 1 server, 3 pc, 4 laptops, 2 fire tvs, 2 game systems) all reaching out to the internet. I run daily backups on my network which files run anywhere from 200 GB - 1.5 TB and upload them to the cloud daily. So please don't assume everyone has the same use case as yourself. Most ask questions for a reason, but sometimes its just because they are curious. But If I can spread that additional bandwidth around it would be beneficial to me. If it's not going to make a difference, then there would be no need for me to upgrade my speed.",

Absolutely wouldn't do it if I had to pay the full price. But I would love to see about 20 MB/s - 30 MB/s download/upload speeds. Theoretically I should get 250 MB/s at 2 Gpbs speeds, but we know that will never happen. I figured if I upgraded to 5 Gbps maybe the devices that have the 2.5 Gb NIC would be able to receive/send 20 MB/s - 30 MB/s. I'm just wondering would the increase bandwidth give an increase yield to those devices? If so, then it would definitely be worth it to me.",

When the device reaches its temperature threshold it will stop charging until the temperatures drop back down below the threshold. At least that’s how several of my devices are designed. For instance my iPhone will stop charging if I’m charging it while playing games and it gets too hot. It’ll do the same thing if the temperature is too hot outside and I’m charging. I assume that’s what’s going on with your computer.",
