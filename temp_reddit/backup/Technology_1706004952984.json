I imagine it's some stupid SEO trick to make search results think all the old content is always newer than it is. I see it going both ways in date range searches where it'll say a post is hours old but it's actually a decade old or it'll say a page is 8 years old and it's from 2 weeks ago.",

That includes the area required for support infrastructure - roads, power collection cabling, etc.\n\n6600 terawatt hours is about 50% more than the total electrical use in the U.S. in 2023. So really what we need is capital and storage. Gravity storage is likely to be the most cost effective at scale, and has the added benefit of being fairly low tech with no need for expensive elements like lithium or cobalt.\n\nSo... basically the country could be using fully renewable energy without any real technology advancement if we just spent the money. Personally I'd be fine with buying a few less next gen aircraft carriers to make this happen, but that's just me.",

Part of that consideration will be environmental impact, energy production, and ease of connection to power grid. Trying to minimize environmental damage is part of the goal and probably not super hard given how relatively barren and open parts of the dessert are.\n\nBut I guess actually reading the article is hard and having a dumb ass knee jerk reaction is easy.\n\nAlso even with valid concerns of effecting the dessert eco systems.

The extra time saved on not commuting plus being able to do errands around the house when I'm not super busy (as opposed to slogging through smalltalk with coworkers or aimlessly walking around the office) or going to the store on my lunch break is just too valuable.\n\nMaybe if I lived across the street from my office I'd go in more. I do miss that separation of concerns. I have trouble sleeping sometimes because I don't have a dedicated office space and my desk is next to my bed, but that tradeoff is worth it.

Office buildings are designed with the majority of their floor plans fully enclosed, both for greater space efficiency, better heating and cooling with less surface area, and cheaper construction. There simply isn't a way to insert windows into a block wide office building.\n\nIn addition to the issues with windows, there is also the issue of plumbing. Office buildings are designed with extremely condensed plumbing, compared to apartments. Any given floor has a handful of bathrooms with several stalls/sinks, plus a kitchen or two. Converting to residential means completely tearing that out and replacing it with individual bathrooms and kitchens in every new unit. Most floors simply aren't able to accommodate that level of complete overhaul. There are structural concerns which arise when you start trying to run a whole new maze of pipes through a floor designed for a few centralized conduits.\n\nThen there's the heating (centralized), the cooling (centralized), the parking, the elevators, nearly every facet of what makes an office building and office building is unsuitable for residential use and would need to be gutted and revamped.\n\nWhile there are certainly individual buildings that could be converted, the VAST majority would be cheaper to tear down and rebuild as apartments, and that simply isn't profitable. It's cheaper for an owner to default on a their mortgage and walk away from a building, returning to the bank, than to invest in the process of converting to residential. Then the bank can sell off the property at a price which will allow the new owner to offer office rents cheap enough to justify its current use, even as the demand for office space drops.\n\nThe only exception to that is in truly absurd housing markets, where the prospective profits of a new luxury apartment complex outweighs the costs, but those areas didn't get their ridiculous prices by accident. Very often, the zoning board is to blame for the lack of housing, and then the developer runs into the issue from the start.",

Obviously, the shops having to move is still a hassle and rebuilding isn't easy but it's not nearly as bad as them owning a depreciating asset.\n\nI suspect, and maybe this is just naive optimism, that the change is inevitable and this hemming and hawing about remote work is more about creating a soft landing on the corporate balance sheets more than it is about any real expectation that full RTO is the future. I could see a world where hybrid is a common model but the idea that full RTO will exist permanently? Even if the existing companies continue with this track, the reality is that there is an entirely new generation of startups, the future Googles, Microsofts, Meta, etc. of today that are building without wanting an office (because that's extremely expensive and startups are cash poor) who will eventually have large companies that have never even had an in-office culture. When that starts happening, these companies will have no choice to adapt or really struggle to get talent.",

To be honest it felt like a fit. Got to the last few things - comp range, title, reports - all good!\n\nThen the HR lady paused, and you could hear her take a breath. At XYZ corp, we're strongly invested in our culture and have decided to be in the office 5 days a week, we realize it's not for everyone, but it's how we're going forward.\n\nThat's too bad I said The role is really attractive and I enjoyed our chat, I'm really not interested in that structure. I heard her take another breath. ...I'm...uh...It's not the first time you've heard that, is it?\n\nNo she said, No it's not.",

The shift away from traditional offices means a decrease in demand for certain services, such as those associated with office cafeterias, which were once the only nearby food options. Now, people have the freedom to spend their money on better-quality food and other desired items, instead of on commuting expenses like tolls, gas and parking. However, this shift is likely to displace many workers in those service areas. More interestingly, private equity firms and major office space owners, who have taken out substantial loans to invest in commercial real estate, now face the challenge of empty office spaces. This situation has led them to lobby local governments, pushing for policies that would require employers to bring their employees back to physical office spaces.",

Since WFH took off, my state's CBD is (seemingly) struggling:\n\nThe outdoor mall strip within it is suffering from frequent store closings and even on weekends, it's dead\n\nOutside of that outdoor mall strip and nearby university, the CBD is literally D E A D (and they're right next to each other as well)\n\nThe office heavy side of the CBD is a literal ghost town, filled with for lease signs that have been there since COVID\n\nAll of the takeout/cafe/restaurants etc that were aimed at office workers are all shut down (and honestly, good riddance because they'd charge ridiculous amounts of money for mediocre food)\n\nThe street filled with bars and clubs is a shadow of it's former self and also dying. I wouldn't be surprised if a big reason is a lack of post-work drinks. Now the street is filled with the mentally ill and meth-addicted, while most bars/clubs shutdown on the regular.\n\nIf you walked through this CBD, you'd be amazed. Apart from that outdoor mall, it's basically 6 miles of empty streets, closed businesses and empty office buildings. If we had more apartments within our CBD, it's be more economically healthy (but Australians view apartments as second class shelter, while inner city NIMBYs fight tooth and nail to stop them).",

Now!\".\n\nThe ultimate way to get good input was to send out an email to the future participants in the meeting and ask them to come up with 1-3 ideas on Theme X, send the ideas to you at least one day before the meeting, and then the meeting-holder would have great ideas invented at the leisure and with the quiet focus of the person sitting at their own workstation or at home.\n\nThe problem is that in a group environment the loudmouths set the pace and the focus with their initial ideas, and the smarter people who would've offered better suggestions to the boss either don't have the mental creativity when being pushed to perform live (\"Anyone? Any ideas? I'm waiting\"), OR the better idea-people feel stymied to express themselves or feel that their ideas wouldn't gel well with the half-assed ideas laid forward by the loudmouths.\n\nLetting people think alone beforehand makes the future meeting much better because there will be so much more discussion material ready.",

(While 200 is a small sample size, there are very few executive roles in those companies, making Atlassian’s representation fairly close to capturing that specific pool.)\n\n• Atlassian employees are big proponents of the distributed plan. Nearly all (92%) of the 5,000 respondents said the policy (zero mandated in-office days) is integral to their ability to carry out their best work, and 91% say it’s a banner reason that they’re staying at the firm.\n\n \n\n• Nearly all (99%) of the chief executives Atlassian surveyed said they believe that distributed work is the way of the future, and it’s only going to grow in popularity from here.\n\n• Per Atlassian’s research, 1 in 3 Fortune 500 and 1000 bosses whose companies mandate some amount of in-person work say that the rule hasn’t impacted productivity at all. Those same executives were three times as likely to say that how their people work is more important than where they work.\n\n• Even part-time in-office arrangements are a policy failure, Atlassian’s Annie Dean explained, which might be a blow to bosses who think they’re offering a compromise in the form of a hybrid plan. “Hybrid is an illusion of choice,” she said.\n\n• As the 1,000 Days retrospective makes clear, the office itself won’t actually solve any productivity, innovation, or creativity issues leaders are facing. “Those are all how to work problems, not where to work problems,” Dean told Fortune back in July—a sentiment the report echoes.",

Since the US has figured out how to use fusion for bombs the research into it dried up. In the past 50 years the spend 6 billion on it, 2 billion of it in the past 2 years. Do you know how much the US paid to clean up 1 single coal ash spill in the early 2010’s? 4 billion dollar! That is just one, there are 1400 coal ash ponds in the US that could break and need cleanup too. They companies made their profits and never bothered to clean up. There have been over a dozen spills.\n\nThe US spend 2,5% of the GDP for a decade to go to the moon. People speak as if the investment in fusion is similar, well its not. Even at 1 billion dollars a year it’s not even close. 2.5% would be 0,5 trillion dollars a year.\n\nResearch in this wouldn’t be wasted even if it would turn out fusion isn’t viable after all. It would boost domestic industry a ton as it would have to be manufactured domestically. It would provide thousands of Americans with jobs and develop valuable technology that could be used in other fields too. Instead of subsidizing dying industries to stave off the inevitable or giving yet another tax break that really is “going to lower the cost of living this time” the US could be stimulating the economy. Paying people to rebuild infrastructure and prepare the country for the next generation. No matter what happens the country is going to need electricity, roads, bridges, railroads, rivers with functional locks.... refusing to fund infrastructure and research into it is just sabotaging yourself and the next generation.

This isnt the only one, and thee have been at least 7 that have cost over 1 billion dollars that are unlikely to make back their investment.\nZumwalt class ships, 35,5 bilion at least, probably more because of canceled partially build ships.\n\nwar in Afghanistan, 2.3 trillion dollars ovr 20 years, 115 bilion a year\nPayment errors, in 2022 there were an estimated $247 billion in payment errors.\n\nBasically the average yearly payments of 120 million for fusion are 1/2000 of the “meh, keep the change” margin of error on the US government payments. Even the 1 billion in the last 2 years isnt even close.

It has a couple dozen major countries participating and some of them arent talking to each other at this time. Parts were built in different countries and some didnt quite fit each other and are undergoing remachining. There was some concern the radioactivity of some of the structural parts due to intense neutron bombardment was underestimated, so they are exploring new materials. I think they were going to propose a new, slower schedule this year.\n\nThere are several fusion startups. They are more tightly run than ITER and may achieve commercial fusion first. The one here about most is the one spun out of MIT. It took years to perfect high temperature superconducting magnets, so it sounds like than part is working. Commonwealth Fusion isnt building a commercial size reactor first, but something big enough to test the principles.",

Out of curiousity, I checked if there were any solar storms, and yup, on that exact day, there was a strong flare with images all over the weather pages. Still not sure if coincidence because I don't think solar storms can cause such disruptions to power network, but from my 31 years on this planet, I never saw such a widely spread mess.",

Better article about it. It's bad news because the storms can be so widespread and as far as I know, most electrical systems are more or less bespoke. If they blow up it takes a long time to replace, and there aren't units just laying around to replace what you need because they have to be manufactured specifically.",

For the average person to notice any adverse effects aside from maybe your gps being off an extra few feet, we’re going to need an exceptional storm that not only reaches the maximum classification of G5, but makes weaker G5 storms pale in comparison. (the last G5 we got was 20 years ago and didn’t complicate really anything despite being powerful enough for Aurora to be visible in all us states except Hawaii.) these things aside, space weather can be really interesting, and the next few years are going to be a really good time to see some Aurora for the first time. some amazing resources include spaceweatherlive.com and Dr. Tamitha Skov on YouTube.",

Not in terms of positions. So this could very well mean that more positions are actually lost, but since they are lower -wage jobs, they don't make up a majority of \"dollar wages.\" I.e. if one person makes a million dollars, and 10 people make 40k, you could lay off those 10 people, and still have not laid off the majority of \"dollar wages.\" - Their focus on \"jobs where computer vision is employed\" is a weird sample group. I'm not clear how much we can extrapolate these findings to the overall labor market. - Regardless of the last two points, 23% is still a huge number of jobs. Imagine getting put into a room with all your coworkers, and the CEO comes in and says, \"23% of you are about to be laid off.\" This isn't going to reassure anyone, lol.",

I then review it and look for problems, make sure it didn't misunderstand me, etc - if I want to keep working on it with GPT, I totally can, but I have to know my freaking python to do it or that script is going to eat shit and start going downhill if I blindly trust each revision. - to think it will replace me is laughable. Now will I replace the guy next to me who cries about AI and takes two days to complete the same task that takes me 3 hours? Yeah probably, but that's always the case when people fail to pick up the newest tools and techniques of their industry. Air brushers had to learn to Photoshop. Photoshop replaced them? No, artists who learned Photoshop replaced them.\n\nOther than a cybersecurity hacker guy, I'm an artist as a hobby. With AI I can kick start a project and paint what I want over it. I make its instant-art into something with more meaning. AI still can't paint a picture that tells a story or a scene that gives you an emotional response. It makes art that looks like art. There's a difference. - Will fast working AI-using artists replace ones who refuse to use it? Maybe, but the people acting like the CEO is AIing everything and laying everyone off is kind of laughable.\n\nIf Q* or whatever the next iteration is has more brains and creativity, my opinion will change but it might be as far off as Elon's car AI acting as an Uber while you sleep - or being fully self driving.

They’re in competition with each other to make [product] in their factories.\n\nEach of their workers can make 1 [product] every day, and each company employs 100 workers. So each company is producing 100 units of [product] per day.\n\nNow let’s imagine that Company A invents a technology that lets the worker double their output to 2 units per day.\n\nWhat would happen in this scenario? Would Company A’s CEO fire half of the staff because now they only need 50% of the workers?\n\nOf course not, that would be silly. Instead, they’re going to double their output to 200 per day and out-compete Company B once and for all.\n\nMy point is that AI isn’t going to replace humans until the human’s involvement itself becomes a hindrance rather than an enabler. In other words, the AI has to be better on its own vs AI with a human.\n\nTo say that we’re nowhere near that is an understatement, even with the acceleration that’s happening.

So if a technology becomes available for enterprise to reduce the amount of hands required and double the production, they won’t be magically outputting 2 units between the 100 of them, they will have reduced manpower requirement but the input output will remain the same as the demand won’t magically go up, warranting an increase in production by the companies on the market. There’s no need to make 2 per day, but there is a need to make producing the one they still have to make cheaper.

The main driving force behind business now isn't manufacturing considerations, it's marketing.\n\nThere's only so much people can consume, and what is more, what they can afford to consume.\n\nMost companies, even as their costs of production go down, constantly are trying to push into higher profit per unit territory, not less.\n\n​\n\nThe craziest part? Yeah sure, company A will intentionally lose money to make those 200 units at a lower price than company B - until they've outcompeted them, then they will jack up prices to probably higher than where they were before, and to do so, they will lay off staff to create artificial scarcity and thus much higher demand for their products (NVidia did exactly this).\n\nThen, someone will be like \"well we could totally enter the market at these prices and undercut them!\" But in response, company A, with a huge warchest, could just drop the prices on their goods and ramp up production (humans have very little to do with economic output, we are maybe 1/10th of the productivity of an enterprise) to kill the competition, and then simply go back to the scarcity bullshit citing supply chain issues or labor market issues lol.\n\nGame theory even predicts the emergence of oligopolies in such markets.\n\nThe reality is that anything that has a large amount of capital or domain expertise to get started is not an area that new players can enter, and increasingly, that's more and more areas. Our industries are becoming more and more ossified, and really we need the government to step in to control profit margins so that people aren't being screwed",

You ask me and the guy beside me to write a system that crawls unlisted open directory servers from a list of censys results and I'll have that shit working in a day with GPT. My colleague that hates AI will be back in a few days.\n\nIt still takes work and knowing your tech. AI also can't just make that system and integrate it into our other scripts and workflows - you need a human using the AI like the tool that it is. My boss cannot make the shit I make with AI because he's missing the required knowledge and he knows it. He also doesn't give a shit that I use AI to kick start my shit. He only cares about my script working and wonders why my colleague has been arguing with people on stackoverflow for 3 days without progress lol",

This can easily be a two week project, but here’s the catch, all of the data the analytics team is collecting is being collected from publicly available online resources. Now imagine if that manager could ask an AI assistant to summarize all online data from the last ten years concerning road safety.

He spends a lot of hours and attention each week aggregating and delivering information vs working on opportunities with customers. It is basically impossible to justify hiring a full time employee and training them to do 10 hours of work each week, but if we can get AI to do that 10 hours of work, he could legitimately double his revenue generating productivity.\n\nI do that once, then I can justify hiring another full time person and train them, knowing they can use AI to scale their abilities up, as well. There are more marginal dollars to play with in terms of upside.\n\nEventually, I can work on all the projects that I believe will generate massive returns, but we don’t have the bandwidth of expertise and capital to currently pursue.\n\nRule of thumb in my industry is that if I want to hire someone, there needs to be an upside of 5x their salary in gross profit dollars. AI can make that number much easier to hit.\n\nSo I’m not looking to cut headcount- I’m looking to increase productivity with my current headcount, so I can hire more people to do all the things I see that need to be done for us to improve as a business.\n\nI’m at the forefront of advocates in my company in pushing for AI adoption. Trust me, we all make way more money if we increase productivity, hire more people, and grow the business, than we do if we increase productivity and cut people.",

Solar is typically at most effective during the summer, since the days are longer, but when winter comes around and the days grow shorter, that's when you break out the coal and oil to pick up the slack. And of course, you've got wind power doing work all year round, on top of hydroelectrics, wave/tidal power, etc, so even if solar loses efficacy during the winter, the \"slack\" can be more evenly-distributed among other sources, and thus we don't need to burn quite as much.\n\nIn general, it makes sense to stock up for the winter, rather than dip into it when nature is at its most bountiful, then wonder why you don't have anything to sustain you through leaner times. That's why pickling, sugaring, smoking, curing, etc, came about, 'cause you want to have food last long enough to still be edible during the winter, when there isn't as much food around.",

You can put solar panels on your house that can power your house for 6 hours a day on most sunny days. Great, but you still have it connected to the grid and sometimes the grid needs to assume the whole load. So the wires running to your house still need to be the same size as if you didn’t have solar, so does the neighborhood transformer. Finally, even the power station needs to be the same size for your town. And those transformers and power stations are most efficient at full load\n\nThis means that when you take load off of the grid, it actually becomes less efficient. A generator running at 75% of rated load produces far fewer kW per gallon of fuel. The transformer efficiency also drops down(except for Liquid Metal, but that’s an esoteric topic)\n\nTraditionally, power companies have paid for their generators and all of the distribution equipment. By charging you per kWh, but that doesn’t really work in this scenario. You still require the exact same infrastructure capacity as your neighbor without solar power, but you are buying far less power. So, we are almost certainly going to need an entirely new way of charging for utility power\n\nNone of this is to say that it cannot be done.

If there had even been a bunch of effort put in back then in the infrastructure, research, and training of the nuclear industry, then it might be perfectly reasonable to continue talking about it today.\n\nBut man, anyone still talking about it is either willfully blind or missing the point. Sure, by all means keep current plants open until the end of their life, but when people talk about building new ones they're basically saying \"let's ask private investors to park $10-20 billion into an investment that will take at least a decade, if not more, before it starts being operational\". That's a ridiculous thing to ask, when wind and solar has a much smaller barrier to entry and significantly faster approval and build times.\n\nHonestly, I suspect that there's at least some amount of nuclear industry astroturfing, and if you really want to get a bit conspiratorial, some oil and gas industry astroturfing. The nuclear industry astroturfing is pretty obvious. The oil and gas industry astroturfing would basically be a \"no, no, don't build renewable when we can wait a decade for a bunch of nuclear plants (and burn fossil fuels in the meanwhile)\".",

We're going to pay interest on every ounce of carbon emitted. BUT. https://www.energy.gov/ne/advanced-small-modular-reactors-smrs these are the way forward.\n\nA power plant is a Simple (TM) thing speaking as someone who's done the first intro to thermodynamics tech elective but isn't a physicist specialized in thermo. A boiler superheats water to a high pressure steam and that goes and spins magnets around to generate electricity.\n\nSo you have your coal plant. It takes in X units of water and puts out Y units of steam at T temperature and P pressure. That translates to J joules of energy put into the water per second.\n\nA small modular nuclear reactor can be built at a small modular reactor facility, packaged up, sealed, and shipped by rail and truck to the coal power plant. It can have its old boiler cut out, the new sealed small modular nuclear reactor(s) put back in, calibrated to replace its old boiler exactly, and bam. The coal plant is now nuclear.\n\nWe just had the first planned small reactor plant cancelled after we lost the political will. All y'all nuclear fans need to rally behind small reactors! They are the best answer to turning a SHARP corner with fossil fuels.\n\nYes renewables are lovely. Wind and solar are great. But fast nuclear conversions? That's fucking exciting to me!",

It is the relative velocities because object in space are already going unimaginably fast. Those little bits of space dust are deadly because they have traveling at extremely high speeds because something speed them up millions of years ago and they’ve been flying through space at those speeds ever since.\n\nUnless you happen to be traveling at an extremely high velocity relative to the target you would have to accelerate whatever you are shooting to those speeds. And if you were going that fast relatively, you would need to decelerate extremely fast to avoid being next to the target when the missile hits. That would take a lot of fuel and a lot of time. Also it is a 1 time use. A laser instantly accelerates to the speed of light and can be used as many times as you need as long as you have power.\n\nThen there is the issue of distance. Even going the speed of a missile it would take 15-30 minutes to go thousands of miles. Where as a laser would still be almost instant.\n\nThe only reason we don’t use lasers for missile defense now is because of the atmosphere getting in the way. With small drones becoming more popular we will likely see an increase in laser defense systems on vehicles designed to protect them from drones. Since with the smaller distances being in air isn’t as much of an issue.",

If there was a murder in Town X in 1990, and DNA phenotyping + facial recognition yields a subject who matches the description and was living in Town X in 1990, that’s not enough to arrest and would represent an unreasonable intrusion on that person’s civil liberties. I don’t think it would be an unreasonable intrusion for a judge to sign a warrant compelling a sample of that person’s DNA to see if it’s a match to the DNA recovered from the murder scene. The fourth amendment allows us to balance privacy and criminal justice, and it seems like in this case the privacy intrusion is justified.",

Then you would have to simulate this process into adulthood. We are not even close to being able to do this yet.\n\nIs it possible that a shortcut could be developed? Yes, pretty much anything's possible. Do we have one now? No.\n\nAssessing the relative dosage of genes and types of genes––which is roughly what these scientists are doing––is not a reproducible, accurate way to assess the phenotypic features that arise through natural, complex, organic means.\n\nAnd to address your original assertion, I'd like to add that epigenetics is a fascinating field that studies how an organism's environment affects its genotypic and phenotypic development. Here's an NPR article on the topic: note the picture at the top. Those two girls share the same DNA…so why do they look so different? Even more interesting, extreme circumstances such as famine can also alter the dosage/expression of certain genes. This \"trauma\" can be passed on to the next generation of offspring!",

        "comment": "Some highlights from this investigative piece:\n\nParabon NanoLabs ran the suspect’s DNA through its proprietary machine learning model. Soon, it provided the police department with something the detectives had never seen before: the face of a potential suspect, generated using only crime scene evidence.\n\nThe image Parabon NanoLabs produced, called a Snapshot Phenotype Report, wasn’t a photograph. It was a 3D rendering that bridges the uncanny valley between reality and science fiction; a representation of how the company’s algorithm predicted a person could look given genetic attributes found in the DNA sample.\n\nThe face of the murderer, the company predicted, was male. He had fair skin, brown eyes and hair, no freckles, and bushy eyebrows. A forensic artist employed by the company photoshopped a nondescript, close-cropped haircut onto the man and gave him a mustache—an artistic addition informed by a witness description and not the DNA sample.\n\nIn a controversial 2017 decision, the department published the predicted face in an attempt to solicit tips from the public. Then, in 2020, one of the detectives did something civil liberties experts say is even more problematic—and a violation of Parabon NanoLabs’ terms of service: He asked to have the rendering run through facial recognition software.\n\n“Using DNA found at the crime scene, Parabon Labs reconstructed a possible suspect’s facial features,” the detective explained in a request for “analytical support” sent to the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center, a so-called fusion center that facilitates collaboration among federal, state, and local police departments. “I have a photo of the possible suspect and would like to use facial recognition technology to identify a suspect/lead.”\n\nThe detective’s request to run a DNA-generated estimation of a suspect’s face through facial recognition tech has not previously been reported. Found in a trove of hacked police records published by the transparency collective Distributed Denial of Secrets, it appears to be the first known instance of a police department attempting to use facial recognition on a face algorithmically generated from crime-scene DNA.\n\n...\n\n“It’s really just junk science to consider something like this,” Jennifer Lynch, general counsel at civil liberties nonprofit the Electronic Frontier Foundation, tells WIRED. Running facial recognition with unreliable inputs, like an algorithmically generated face, is more likely to misidentify a suspect than provide law enforcement with a useful lead, she argues. “There’s no real evidence that Parabon can accurately produce a face in the first place,” Lynch says. “It’s very dangerous, because it puts people at risk of being a suspect for a crime they didn’t commit.”\n\n...\n\nGreytak characterizes the company’s face predictions as something more like a description of a suspect than an exact replica of their face. “What we are predicting is more like—given this person’s sex and ancestry, will they have wider-set eyes than average,” she says. “There’s no way you can get individual identifications from that.”\n\n...\n\nAccording to an internal New York Police Department presentation cited by Garvie in her report, NYPD detective Tom Markiewicz wrote in 2018 that the department has tried running face recognition on forensic sketches and found that “sketches do not work.” In another infamous example that Garvie cites in her report, a detective from the NYPD’s Facial Identification Section, after noting that a suspect looked like the actor Woody Harrelson, put a photo of the actor through the department’s facial recognition tool.\n\n“Because modern facial recognition algorithms are trained neural networks, we just don’t know exactly what criteria the systems use to identify a face,” Garvie, who now works at the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, tells WIRED. “Daisy chaining unreliable or imprecise black-box tools together is simply going to produce unreliable results,” she says.\n\n“We should know this by now.\"\n\nThis whole process sounds a lot like the classic GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out) scenario. Unfortunately, with a shiny veneer of technology applied over top, it's easy enough to convince people that the outputs are legitimate, which is an everpresent danger with these kinds of practices.",

But say that based on the DNA phenotyping, law enforcement calls Bob Smith and asks if he’ll voluntarily speak with police about an investigation into an old murder. Bob Smith replies that he’s been waiting for this day, knew that he would be caught eventually, and will respond to police headquarters with the victim’s necklace and the murder weapon, both of which he has kept in his basement these past thirty years.\n\nIn a situation like that, should the whole case be thrown out because of the manner in which the lead was developed?",

Delays in apprehending the correct person by using a process of backwards elimination with a knowingly fallible system can lead to plenty of negative outcomes, including destruction of evidence and recurring offenses.\n\n​\n\nThe innocent suspect might never have been pulled into the equation from the start.

The point is that the government is reasonably limited in how far it can intrude on a person's life.\n\n​\n\nPeople are not the totally rational creatures we like to think we are, and we tend to assume technology eliminates that irrational side. A GIGO system can lure someone to think it's a relatively reliable prediction, and then the \"relatively\" part starts not mattering in our brains anymore.

That's just using AI as an excuse to create random suspect pictures.\n\nWe are still nowhere near being able to predict most characteristics from DNA, let alone facial features. Most forensic DNA sequencing technologies only sequence a tiny part of the genome, enough to be mostly certain DNA is a match with a person with an error of approx 1 in a million (depending on exact process). So in a country like the USA there would probably be a couple of hundred people that match. And the genes that determine facial structure are much more complicated than that. To actually get an idea of how a face could look would require a much more detailed sequencing, and knowledge of how that relates to facial features, this literally does not exist yet. And this is before we consider how environmental and developmental factors can affect facial structure.\n\nWith that in mind, I don't think this is good enough to even give probable cause for arrest. Certainly not good enough for a warrant (though some judges will grant anything admittedly). It's a random number generator in facial form.",

Its hard to show evidence otherwise because, most parents aren't running twin studies, and we don't have a way to look at the alternative timelines where you were a back sleeper instead of a stomach sleeper.\n\nThe other is more obvious - we identify people as much by their skin tone/quality, hair style, makeup, grooming, etc as we do their bone structure and eye color. Those are all variable - and choosing any for the picture influences who is going to be misreported when you show these renderings to the public\n\nLast is this is no where near accurate enough for facial recognition software - Id argue its more likely you'd get a false positive than the correct person back",

He had fair skin, brown eyes and hair, no freckles, and bushy eyebrows. A forensic artist employed by the company photoshopped a nondescript, close-cropped haircut onto the man and gave him a mustache—an artistic addition informed by a witness description and not the DNA sample.\n\nSo in this case all the DNA gave them was a very generic outline of some basic features. Based on that description I (or many others) could be the suspect. Then they had a sketch artist coming to make something out of that description. There is no way to know things like the structure of their jaw line, cheek bones, nose length, etc from what the DNA told them.\n\nIf you put a picture into a facial recognition system with that much uncertainty it's going to spit out bad data 99.9% of the time. When you are talking about potentially charging someone with murder (or at the very least turning their lives inside out while they are investigated for murder) that's not a risk most people are willing to take.",

You just don't have to be a creative writer. AI will be able to take care of the prose as long as you bring the general storyline and characters.\n\nEven that can be generated by specialized AI models just fine.

There have been a bunch of weird novelty big brand crossover things out there for a long time. Just look at Harley-Davidson. You can buy everything from a Harley-Davidson edition GMC Sierra to a Harley-Davidson pickleball set. I wouldn't put a crock pot past them. Same way people buy Coca-Cola merch.\n\nlooking on internet lol \"Ever play Monopoly? Ever play Monopoly while... NASCAR?\" That's a thing for some reason. looking a little more There's a Law & Order Monopoly too. And a Ru Paul's Drag Race set? Hah, that's funny. None of that has any connection to the other.\n\nTruth be told though, I kinda dig that VW Bus cooker in the ads at the bottom. It make's a lot more sense than the truck kind, and it looks... not bad. I would never buy one, but I could definitely see the interest in them.",

Make it less lucrative? yes.\n\nFirst step is understanding the issue isn't AI, but the issue that society as a whole from the general population, to the government, to NGOs, sees pumping absolute garbage is unacceptable, and that the people doing it seen as pirayahs.\n\nThey can't put money in the bank, can't register legal companies, and can't legally hire and pay people via normal means.

Inherently, any translation into low-resource languages are going to be low quality simply because they're low-resource languages. This is akin to saying \"if you put cloth in water, it becomes wet\". It's not exactly some scientific breakthrough, it's the logical outcome.

There's not a thing wrong with demanding more from businesses if their advertising is deceptive. If they were deceiving customers by weasel-wording which is what it looks like this was, they need to fix it. And they need to compensate anyone they did deceive who may have had some damage from the tracking (highly unlikely so this will be punitive more than anything). If they are shown to have managed to skirt regulations they won't have to pay a dime and hopefully people will learn that what they were told is \"incognito\" is actually just an automatic cookie cleaner but they're still tracking your movements. I didn't know either, but I didn't care. I just used incognito as a tool at work when I have a job where the pop-up keeps me from viewing the article for notation. I keep my ad blocker out of incognito mode so I moved quick between windows but these days with F Paywall sites clear off the ad more efficiently I don't even use it for that, but I honestly also thought it meant they didn't track so you didn't have to deal with the ridiculous targeted everything from ads to news to search results.",

Because they don't. All a VPN can help with in terms of privacy and personal data is hide it from your ISP, or anyone else in the chain between you and your VPN provider (so say, the local government if your VPN provider is in another country). Between your VPN provider and your end destination (including the end destination) there is zero protection. The website that you visit is STILL tracking you all the same. And before anyone says that it obscures your IP, IPs stopped being used as a reliable tracking point since smartphones became big, you can not rely on the IP of a smart phone for tracking purposes; they have worked around that.

They are in the middle and expected to always track traffic. That is not what the case is about.\n\nThe case is about the fact that even though Google presents you as logged out (your username/profile does not appear in Incognito windows and it does not present the window as being associated with a Google account) that Google themselves still tracks information in a way that allows them to associate the browsing data with their profile of your information.\n\nThis isn’t about an unavoidable man-in-the-middle. This is about Google tracking data against your account in the background without being obvious about it. I’m not sure why anyone is particularly cool with that.\n\nRealistically, the case had merit because their FAQ under the \"How Incognito mode protects your privacy\" section (linked from the Incognito landing page) stated:\n\nIf you don’t sign in to your Google account, your shopping activity will not appear in your Chrome browsing activity and won’t be saved to your Google Account.\n\nAll while presenting a window with no logged in Google account and also stating.\n\nIf you’re browsing in Chrome Incognito mode, you are, by default, not signed into any accounts or sites.\n\nThis is, at best, misleading to end users on their behalf when Google implemented ways to associate your browsing data to your account behind the scenes.

Also in Europe, GDPR mandates that websites aren't allowed to use things like GA until you give the consent to being tracked, and the default needs to be 'off'.",

Does not matter. IPs stopped being reliable data for tracking since smart phones. You do not have a reliable IP with cellular networks; and that didn’t change anything. They don’t use your IP as a main data point for tracking.\n\nThe actual solution is to get offline or get legislation passed that changes the behavior of the companies.",

Mouses and trackballs were used by military since 50s, trackballs were used in arcade machines sine 70s. GUIs are as old as graphical modes in computers, but were limited to apps that required that mode as text in graphical modes way less readable than in text modes, and you could fit less of it on screen with using more of VERY LIMITED resources to do display it.",

Many people were happy to find out about this difference, and either didn't buy, or bought a 1080p with the same fancy features just without the resolution. Yes, there's upscaling, but a 1080p frame is still 1080p, with or without the processing changes before, after, or without 4k upscaling, there isn't enough benefit to the cost (at least back then, arguably feedable today).\n\nAs for the fast wifi, other than the range and penetration capabilities, a faster wifi can only go as fast as the weakest link. If the cable is rated for 100Mb and not 1Gb, not going to get over 100Mb in speeds (most cables are 1Gb capable, but people don't throw out 10year old network cables, much like phone cables, they all look the same at a glance). Internet not nearly as fast as the wifi? I'd say routers or switches, but 95% of those in use (including those older but still kicking, I replaced one last month) are 1Gb capable now, though some routers might be 1Gb capable, add in some firewall rules, and the processor is likely not fast enough to keep up.\n\nThen you have the winning agreement argument. Do you have any devices capable of using that Wifi7 setup? There's some backswords compatibility, sure, but not getting all of the capability of wifi 7, do your research and weigh your priorities vs costs.\n\nIf you need more coverage, use wifi APs, please avoid wifi bridges/repeaters, each wifi hop only makes the connection slower in speeds and responsiveness. Wifi APs are more like your cell towers, (most) wired into a main line, instead of repeating off of each other, and you move between the APs like Cell towers, with very little to show you moved, while Bridges/Repeaters can result in different wifi names causing hand offs to be unreliable or very slow.\n\nEdit: I allowed autocorrect to do its work while I'm still waking up, that's not the word I was looking for...",

I had a 8yr old Vizio so should be a huge upgrade - just didn’t see the need to upgrade till the content was there. Of course, now I need to refresh my library to 4k as the big streamers have horrible compression and still call it “4k” .\n\nI imagine wifi will be the same. I’ve decreased my bandwidth to 1gb instead of xfinity 1.2 as my current equipment is limited at 1gb. I download ISO’s at 110mb/sec and can easily stream multiple high bit rate shows locally and remote without issue. I can’t see the need but I’m sure once price comes down it will be more standard.

It's there, the average level of tech around hasn't come up to that bar yet to see 4k that often, let alone 8k. Though, I would personally love to experience 8k, in person.\n\nInternet supporting 4k, yes, as u/ReelNerdyinFl mentioned, it's compressed and muddy (pending streaming provider and video content). But great if downloading the whole 4k video and watching it locally. 4k displays are great so long as you can feed it a decent 4source. Garbage in, garbage out. Even AI upscaling and smoothening can do a great job, sure, excluding latency if watching something live or playing a game, and so long as the source footage is decent enough to upscale/smooth from. I recall a video from a couple years ago, I think I know which youtuber, did a review and use of the tech, and the limitations. Obviously, upscaling a 640x480 video to 4K is going to look like shit, but funny results none-the-less, lol.",

Which is a continuous cost, which is only covered if the network is actively making money.\n\nThe advantage is a company can and by its nature has to continuously update and improve each batch of sats produced, more capable, more capabilities and less cost per unit are the goals.\n\nThe key here isn’t who can do what now.

Let me try to give some info from an Indian perspective.\n\nZee and Sony (this is Sony’s India division) have historically been huge players in the TV market. They’re entertainment titans with long-running television series, reality shows etc. Both tried to pivot to streaming but they’ve not done well, Zee in particular.\n\nTwo years ago, they decided to enter a merger. This was huge news - on the scale of Paramount and Warner Bros exploring to merge last December. As you can expect, regulators cracked down on this immediately. Regulators even cleared the merger recently, but suspended Zee’ CEO. Ultimately Sony and Zee can’t decide who should run the combined companies (Zee want their own man which Sony don’t).\n\nRetail investors in India are heavily leveraged on Zee stock and options and really want to see this through.\n\nNow word on the street is, this merger will definitely happen. Sony is playing hardball to get their terms. There’s a pretty big breakup fee involved here too which Zee would definitely not want to pony up. But this explicit declaration by Sony is very interesting and the latest twist in what has been a topsy turvy battle already.",

Eventually they want to sell it for 1000-2000 and it be a pair of glasses. Then it will sell like an Apple Watch. Gonna be an interesting next 10-15 years.",

They turn negative when supply outstrips demand.\nWhile hurricane-force winds brought by Storm Isha are causing disruptions to travel across northern Europe – as well as power cuts in some areas – elevated wind generation offers some respite for the region’s energy supplies after a recent cold blast.

The PA PUC did little beyond encouraging electricity providers to offer payment plans to affected customers.\n\nPresuming Finland has better consumer protections, but maybe not as good as they should be. Read the contract carefully and note the maximum spot price that can be charged. In Texas the cap was $9 per KWH ($9000 per MWH). If the cap is relatively low (ie. 1.5 - 3X of the rate for fixed-priced customers), then it's fine.\n\nIn short, market price contracts are a trade off and don't always lead to the savings people believe unless they closely monitor prices (which can be automated with apps, etc) and take action promptly to curtail usage.

Nearly nothing you said is remotely correct other than the fact they don’t need outside fuel.\n\nWindfarm turbines send the power they generate to a nearby offshore platform, and from there, the electricity gets sent to shore through big cables buried six feet beneath the ocean floors. It’s not like it’s beamed or they run a line for every turbine. one submersible drone can destroy any portion of that delivery system easily. NATO intercept capabilities, underwater, are nowhere what we have with air superiority. A few inland priority sites are 100X easier to protect, including during a first strike.\n\nSolar farms would work better, but theres the issue of raw materials and rare earth metals to replace them (cadmium, gallium, germanium, indium, selenium, and tellurium) Most of that is imported for less than friendly countries. Can’t build new ones with no material.\n\nAnyways, renewables are the future but our current application of them is a huge weakness if the worst happens. It’s not something to risk without engineering some way to protect them.",
