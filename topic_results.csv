It\'s hard rule, sometimes nice finish project without learn whole new language... frameworks best practices limited budget.If personal project, cares. Sometimes, I use latest trend exposure, times, l drop it.I like think code wanderer. A Ronin...The Vue documentation tries explore advantages SSR using language back front .TL/DR: isomorphism unified mental model.It also discusses disadvantages.When I started web development 1990s JavaScript VBScript client-side scripting. Microsoft world moved server-side heavy solutions ASP.NET JavaScript stuck around.Later 2000s, sudden flurry client-side functionality enabled features web browsers. JavaScript fill need client-side scripting. REST APIs, Ajax jQuery began shifting focus client. JavaScript got popular eventually people started using backend. Most notably Node.js 2009.JavaScript tool needed it‚Äôs riding wave.I can\'t discuss specific frameworks, places I\'ve worked, they\'ve migrated TypeScript pretty much everything, reason straightforward: types.You configure monorepo housing hundreds projects, including full-fledged back-ends, front-ends, microservices, lambda functions, more, effortlessly share type-safe code among them. Especially something like tRPC.This something achievable Ruby Python, instance.In general, strongly typed languages contribute maintainable scalable codebases long run. Sure, accomplish anything either, guarantee enjoyable working experience. Plus, catching bugs code ever gets chance run.JS isn‚Äôt dominating enterprise grade backends far.JS/TS\'s dominance partly widespread use vibrant ecosystem. But diving Python Django eye-opening. Django\'s comprehensive nature simplifies many tasks. I\'ve used Js frameworks, Flask, Rails, Django more, I actually stuck Django fast I move it. I\'m building Django-based tool significantly cuts development time even SaaS projects - complete boilerplate.Ease deployment small footprint. You cram 800 dockerized/container microservices running 800 small Node REST APIs single 32gb server.That powerful. Some stacks, lucky run 20 30 hardware.And stuff like async.Upload video file. Process uploaded, wait till finish. That type workloads really shine.JS also battery included framework like Laravel, Rails etc.It\'s AdonisJS.I\'m convinced JavaScript dominant; I see plenty python, java, c#, go, on, dealings companies I scan job postings.We got Google wanted compete traditional software companies, meant making good interactive web apps. Java applets Flash great forward paths, invested heavily JavaScript engines tooling. That eventually lead JavaScript considered ""a real language"", creation Nodejs could run JavaScript outside browser. Shiny new things shiny new things, hype-chasers picked good enough establish lasting community even hype moved on.There\'s hype cycle built around ""The latest greated JS library/tool/framework"" captured attention last years mature frameworks get ignoredBecause times don‚Äôt need whole framework. I‚Äôm curious JS wasn‚Äôt dominant webdev? ü§∑\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏èease use deployment I\'d imagine. Web browsers support front end, generating tons people familiar JavaScript back-ported server-side. thus making learn another language.There‚Äôs loads great web frameworks about, many arguably better things like NextJS. The problem though comes time server side render React components whatever, need run code client. So need use js. That means there‚Äôs whole class features other-language framework literally can‚Äôt implement language. There exceptions like Blazor it‚Äôs popular bunch trade offs - I see growing though.If you‚Äôre using React ilk there‚Äôs still argument made using single language code makes things easier, makes easier recruit staff move capacity around. There‚Äôs also LOT js developers around, although skill level vast majority debatable.Because doesn‚Äôt matter backend framework use, FE JS.So smaller companies personal projects, simple everything language. BE/FE share code, API types imported, convenient.Javascript programming language dominates fronted.The others frameworks - programming languages - used backend.They don\'t. Most Nodejs server projects I\'ve seen backend-for-frontend projects. Yes run code server, they\'re really implementing front-end/display logic managed frontend team needs finer control HTTP servers. They\'re rarely actual backend implements actual meat business logic.Front end devs lazy learn anything else.JS common programming language one needed fromt-ends. Easier recruitment big deal.Django Rails MVCs, designed CRUD servers specified rsources. Pass-throughs kinds servers need something else.JS works JS packages. There rendering options, SDKs. JS SDKs advantage working front-end back-end, SDK-writers go JS.Here\'s I\'ve experienced used many backend languages. Beyond super obvious:Node good simple things. Getting data databases. Python fast. Also, node breaks quickly try mash really complex business logic backend. So people much.Python better complex things. This also weakness. It tempting mash bunch complex business logic flask portion, turns nightmare quickly.Node easy put containers. I find flask bit harder put containers.Almost tech perfectly serviceable simpler sites. But, data starts dancing around backend complex ways, getting architecture right fantastically important.Some people use justify favourite framework. But, choosing correct tech solve correct problem.Thus, combo I personally like node backend, keep super clean business logic. Then, I python(not flask) complex business logic things either runs timers, responds messages complex things. It send messages return. Then, node simplistically process messages.This evolved many ML projects, course, ML fairly high chance python, nature, going complex business logic. There exactly zero percent chance I ML js. It done, far industry norm.This said, I projects back end C++. I could make long winded argument it, simple example unencrypted response times measured milliseconds, microseconds. I\'ve noticed rust web crates significantly faster I using C++; thus would benefit way.Believe me, JS devs even like JS strong hold web, frankly I really wish blazor would get better choiceA big issues Django, Flask, Rails... dont scale well big organizations complex multi tier projects. This big tech orgs dont use much.That mean Django bad build great stuff it. Its figuring ownership boundaries 6+ engineering teams contributing single Django app hard.It ends having:A dedicated front end layerA backend domain layer composed microservicesIs least bad model organizations want scale engineering teams single team single product.Now people outside big orgs end following pattern? My guess gets popularized big players, people learn certain set skills, stick know... since adopting skills particular use case hard.I started 20 years ago worked many backends. To brain drain. I work JavaScript anyway soon I could use backend brainer. Even node good I still using I hate context switching. Now node progressed lot I see drawbacks whatsoever. It\'s actually faster offers better async syntax many others. For reason brainer use JavaScript / TypeScript whenever possible. I even use JavaScript mobile - react native. It makes efficient.There handful JavaScript quirks people always point out, honestly way overstated. Pretty much anyone knows make sure limit equivalencies use specific flow statements. You\'d learn quirks language anyway. One funny thing JavaScript looks almost identical C like Brendan Eich made context.Today I see like verbal languages. What language business? English? What pilots speak sky? English. It makes things efficient everyone talk other. Yeah good context languages draw from, also really good universal language.You still need JavaScript plan interactivity using frameworks. JavaScript frontend language browser, need client side interactivityDjango used make non-interactive pages2 reasons mostly...1) Allowing browser work significantly reduces hosting costs2) Most JS projects using multiple legacy systems, sometimes 3 backends, tech allows backends work single frontend high demandfor django flask think front end js devs intimidated jinja2 templates. they\'re like ""ahhhh, simple"".10 years ago case, oposite true, rails, Django, Laravel, etc. dominant node.js used almost one.Several things happening ultimately made node win:There big shift server first client first web apps, users demanded better UX apps complex build, easer use. In order make development easier tools emerged, usually written js, run nodeThere need better performance, handle request per minute, node non blocking IO async programming model, suddenly ease write web servers could handle multiple request per tread, opposed popular frameworks one request per thread. Also JS much faster language compared Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, 20x fasterNPM, far easiest package manager use. pip -r requirements.txt painful useNode simple deploy linux server compared Python, Ruby, PHPJava dominates JS doesn\'t. If making isomorphic apps, there\'s reason go two different interpreted languages.FamiliarityGiven TypeScript, language actually quite goodV8 somewhat fast. At least faster Python RubyIt\'s single-threaded garbage-collected language, simpler writeAbundance libraries relative simplicity dependency management NPMNow, I also love Rust, newer language that\'s difficult learn due borrow checker support concurrency multi-threading. Rust makes development feel really good encourages code quality, famous easy, TS/JS widely considered good fast enough, much mystery people prefer itThose worse DXLotta good answers here. Another I haven‚Äôt seen yet downstream effect browser needing JS, separation. Web apps used hairball-like w/ backend merging client code. Which meant changes effected entire apps codebase.Separating means ability upgrade/rewrite section app(like client) maintaining backend‚Äôs infrastructure place.That\'s like asking car popular could drive Mustang...It‚Äôs full circle moment. Those frameworks suck client side.A big reason bootcamps shifted (1) React HUGELY popular time little places demanding skill, (2) teach literally browser; IDE needed.I love ruby heart challenging bootstrap rails app JS app. Not impossibly harder, enough. Or rather, SIGNIFICANTLY easier setup js app rails app, creates friction using rails bootcamps. Most bootcamps used rails switching react.There reasons JS dominates I see mentioned yet:there reinforcing cycle javascript already widespread (out necessity web apps), lot staying power answers easy find google, stackoverflow, chatGPT (LLMs favor popular languages data train on)most bootcamps stick javascript learn frontend backend w/o learn multiple languages (well besides html/css)same small teams - easy 1 person build fullstack javascript app w/o jump languages. And offers flexibility replacing parts stack team/org/company expands (e.g. replace front end .js typescript backend go)Rails (and perhaps choices) mutually exclusive JS frameworks, work hybrid, slowly evolving website, legacy pages full ERB, Vue components mounted within ERB, pages entire page Vue app, closer SPA style without front end routing.It\'s like asking CSS dominate there\'s web frameworks.JS option client side programming.I feel like it‚Äôs dominating certain use case (SPAs) rather everywhere.Plus build stuff pretty fast amount churn JS ecosystem means long term maintenance bit headache.It language picked browsers. The rest little bit ""obvious"".Because people learn JS never want learn anything else. And instead learning new language, bunch enablers made possible put JS everywhere love smell shit blasted everywhere much.JS one advantage runs web browsers. That\'s IT.Reading comments, feels like watching ladies picking fruits market, everyone favourite can‚Äôt please everyone.Think it‚Äôs easier dispel myth claimed start with.JS dominate.

I\'ve always told use practice, I never get I guess are.I boat last year! Interviewing senior role one company kept asking questions like this. I found really strange they\'re asking theory questions expecting recall definition things. It felt like college exam, interview. I learned I first learning, things I still remember course things forget years go on. IMO terrible way interview senior role, remembering little details onclick event work nothing help determine able things seniors do.Anyways, like others saying, forget move on. You\'ll find something, smarter give credit forDon‚Äôt worry man. I‚Äôve bombed some, tech interviews always seem like roll dice. Who knows you‚Äôre going get!Hey, I\'m senior c# developer, 10 years, worry much - always things know. Just take breath look things mentionedYou extend classes JavaScript inheritance: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_class_inheritance.aspThe click one I\'m really sure wanted could whole host things really, buttons used many things, submitting forms, click handler say. So I can\'t help there.Best thing ask company (or recruitment agency) specific feedback say ""you technical"" enough know probably dodged bullet.Everyone doubts good enough, technical interviews weird ask million different potential questions, ive weird wacky ones time. If dont know, dont know ü§∑ nothing even prepare things aware of. If youve dev 6 years obviously knowledge üôÇIs little imposter syndrome voice back head right?Do I truly deserve I am?They\'ve tested javascript knowledge found lacking. You may developer looking for. Yet, job, means people willing pay knowledge skills, presumably finding valuable, paying you. They must think deserve now.Don\'t stress much it. We\'ve there. If helps, I usually look every job interview learning experience. If I well advance, that\'s extra perk. Otherwise, conversation know. If feel like (or couldn\'t) answer question well, write spend time learning next interview. As others said, never know people going ask lot times, asked weird questions probably blessing get job.Sobering moment. Happens best us. Yes, meant event bubbling prototype inheritance. Learn better next time. I would recommend Jake Surma\'s videos. Also, ""10 things know JS probably don\'t"" YouTube video series. (Turns 15 things)I think click event looking see knew event bubbling, quite common interview question.I assume wanted know event loop click button adds ""message"" event loops queue described here. I think event loop questions common JS interviews. Regarding inheritance, I think wanted know prototype JS vs non prototype inheritance e.g. Java said.As others said harsh yourself, probably really preparation issue. Check common JS interview questions refresh basics.You said yourself, unprepared. Never go interview without idea going into. You asking contacts ahead time expect may adequately prepare.Other that, need confidence. If make excuses talk self taught think struggling, snitching yourself. Don\'t give reasons question ability.You said web developer 6+ years. You\'re web developer definition. Folks paid lot money high skill work many years. Own it. Understand single engineer knows everything. There always questions interview know answer to, that\'s reflection skill level.There couple good courses udemy specifically covering interview questions like this. I never remember terminology I\'ve 25 years. Every time I\'m looking new job I brush one classes.Buy rwad book ""The imposter\'s handbook"" fabulous really well written funny he\'ll super interesting.The whole idea filling gaps missed self taught. I self taught felt intimidated college interviews I understand big notation.This book really helped me. I mean I still understand big notation I give shitThere nothing wrong self taught developer. One best ways get impostor syndrome thingsKnow stack focus heavily it.Pick stack want specialize really read it. Even though I know C# I still read books teach C# authors often minutia ideas I see elsewhere.Even know React, read book it.Read code.C# Javascript great easily jump source code learn something. For example, I wanted learn calculation Geospatial distance differed code SQL Server results. I decompile code really dug get understanding calculated. It also gave deeper appreciation things done.When read code identify certain code bad. You\'ve seen patterns practices across different teams identify what\'s maintainable solution. You also feel confident write identify people idiots.Don\'t stop learning.Devote 1-2 hours day (even could time) reading new tool technology. I Morning Brew homepage I read articles c# stay date.Get Pluralsight O\'Reilly books subscription. You get Acm membership less $200 (normally would cost 5-700/year)I always tell teams difference senior junior technical prowess way behave team. You brilliant engineer, due lack life experience ego behaves poorly. I expect senior afraid vulnerable, know admit what‚Äôs unknown, ask questions clarify information, help team clients, cast blame, tolerant understanding, Rambo anxious panic, drive project success selfesly. Lots people claim actually don‚Äôt. You usually find ‚ÄúI‚Äôve pulling team forever I‚Äôm appreciated‚Äù, ‚Äúnobody listens me‚Äù crowd.Edit: also, OP, apply senior position think party expects you. Waaaaay often techs think hiring manager wants kind leet genius, 80% time way around. The hiring manager wants see fit easily within team. Are nice person, communicate well, serious serious? Can take joke? Do panic shut pressure? Can integrate quickly? Can help team members? Everything else taught demonstrate reasonable tech understanding. Behavioral skills hardest change. Good luck next interviews. Be brave!I almost situation, sole developer many years experience something senior med level deep experience front back. The day I interviewed nice position Big Buck I failed answer couple questions tricky required deep theoretical knowledge JS yet wasted time extra round create take home test performed well in.This stuff used day-to-day jobs. My clients care performance, user experience, maintainability, scalability, integration, fast delivery, clean code, etc. None care know vdom, keyword, internal gears js, vue, react. It seems kind question flex knowledge others dismiss aspects developer knowledge experience.In course couple interviews understand gaps, learn confidentHey look üëÄ. I NEED feel confident . Cause aren‚Äôt hell I supposed look mirror every morning I less experience you.Just remember taught get far. You bend others break. Just keep going.When know something interview, two cents: it. Don\'t fret, scramble, lie. Remain calm, say know it, try navigate conversation point. In case JavaScript inheritance whatever, ""I\'ve heard term perfectly honest something I\'ve encountered X number projects I\'ve successfully completed. Could expand kind use cases environment?""Then they\'ll tell something listening, thinking real time back experiences. What describe might something know, turns terminology difference. Or describe particular problem, say instead solved problem, always looking new techniques thanks insight.That\'s difference junior senior. Senior, like half battle conversation. Even know it, interviewer likes conversational style, put ego front, admitted knowing something, may still walk away chance.When I‚Äôve bombed interviews I I almost always find later seemed like great opportunity time would horrible path go down‚Ä¶or least great opportunity came later.I can\'t speak technical elements, 6+ years business, multiple clients, multiple stacks/technologies/languages anything imposter, I think people would impressed that.look i\'m self taught, afterall that\'s ALL college anyway...but sadly gaps knowledge work remedy. Example, I hired worked self taught guy years ago project, dude great terms churning code getting stuff done, real knack CSS/JS I lacked good parternship. But sold \'full stack\' (which meaningless point IMO) started database/API type shit fucking disaster, like basic understanding referential integrity ACID many pitfalls go along writing effective performant backend. There\'s reason CS degrees, basically 4 years shit could better learned 2, give really strong core fundamentals build off. I whole notebook do\'s gotchas dev profs passed along, invaluable young devNow know. Your prospective co-workers going care past projects well delivered. They looking baseline competency mid-to-senior level engineer. That typical process driven engineering organization. I know I would never care Shopify Wordpress experience. It irrelevant I day-to-day. However, javascript fundamentals important need many current frameworks Vue, React Angular.You sound like better fit product role.They imposters.I went situation gone through. I similar background. Anyway, came learn interviews really ramp difficulty depending company.While I don‚Äôt think feel bad - tons people fails interviews time - better position perform next ones.

Most fairly narrow geographical reaches loads. Think Amazon delivery vans, garbage trucks 18 wheelers bring produce food products suburban distribution centers big grocery stores every day. None trucks anywhere world problems running batteries. Range load aren‚Äôt issues.As case point, Pepsi running 21 Tesla Semis regular routes 450 miles Sacramento, California distribution center. They carrying Frito Lay potato chips full loads soft drinks.In September 2023 large data gathering event occurred, ""Run Less"" event organized North American Council Freight Efficiency (NACFE). The loads, routes charging 22 different electric semi trucks multiple manufacturers used different organizations different parts USA captured compared. While Tesla‚Äôs Semi charging head shoulders rest, trucks vendors easily 150 miles day real loads routes.There‚Äôs lot noise Class 8 trucks weight even empirical reality Tesla hauling Pepsi hundreds miles isn‚Äôt putting bed. But weight trucks potential damage roads red herrings.Current battery electric semi tractors heavier fully fueled long-haul diesel tractors. Battery energy density today still requires lot batteries achieve ranges Tesla manufacturers delivering. In USA, Class 8 trucks limited loaded vehicle weight 80,000 pounds, 36 metric tons. Most jurisdictions permitted electric semis 2% 3% heavier.When I discussed David Cebon, founder Centre Sustainable Road Freight, roads expert mechanical engineering professor Cambridge earlier year made points worth repeating.Class 8 trucks simply lowest common denominator freight trucks North America. Every country state allows operate, freely cross borders. However, many US states Michigan already allow much heavier trucks roads, case double 80,000 pounds. Class 8 regulatory convenience, hard limit, allowing electric Class 8 trucks slightly heavier issue.The decades-ago US study found exponential relationship weight axles road damage deeply flawed. A two-year study closed loop significant frost heave damage second year, wasn‚Äôt accounted statistical study botched. Despite this, became accepted rule civil engineering anti-EV meme.It‚Äôs thoroughly debunked, including Cebon long turned decarbonization trucking. Much heavier trucks fully loaded Class 8 electric trucks already running roads globally road damage claims true, roads would rubble months.But range? Clearly already large part trucking industry‚Äôs operational requirements met current batteries. But trucks run lot 450 miles long-haul trucking. The longest range US diesel truck around 2,100 miles fully fueled, USA, far I tell, relies far trucking freight movement geographies.Is within range battery electric energy densities? It certainly is. The world‚Äôs largest EV battery manufacturer, China‚Äôs CATL, started manufacturing shipping battery twice energy per unit weight ones Tesla‚Äôs trucks cars year. It‚Äôs initially focused electric aviation market, selling road vehicles 2024. The 450 miles becomes 900 miles single charge, 1,000 miles one Semis traveled single day rounds potentially increases 1,500 miles including time high speed chargers.That‚Äôs batteries commercially available right now. Four different organizations I‚Äôm aware multiple countries overcome technical challenges commercializing silicon battery chemistries. The theoretical energy density maximum five times CATL‚Äôs new batteries. Only doubling required provide equivalent range diesel semis viable lighter tractor hence load.Most analyses dismiss batteries trucking make assumptions batteries still improving rapidly metrics price energy density.But still, doesn‚Äôt solve system problem. We need get electricity new batteries. Different countries different rules drivers, USA allowing drive far longer fewer rests Europe. Europe‚Äôs rules provide lots time charging USA‚Äôs new batteries high speed chargers.But get high speed chargers truck stops get electricity truck stops. In many parts world, isn‚Äôt particularly onerous. In long rural routes USA relatively weak grid, it‚Äôs bit challenging. Tesla solved cars building world‚Äôs reliable inter-city high-speed charging network, something it‚Äôs four continents. Tesla making 1 MW power Megacharger new standard network, every Tesla Supercharger location able charge Tesla Semis. Other vendors catch up.Even that, range CATL batteries 900 miles, Tesla Semi would charge twice middle country cross entirety USA. It‚Äôs onerous build sufficient chargers initially small number electric trucks keep adding every year. It‚Äôs like electrify every truck stop tomorrow.The power requirements easily managed batteries charging locations buffer arbitrage electricity. There studies bad assumptions battery energy densities prices try pretend delivering three times much electricity refueling stations make hydrogen truck fuel somehow almost cheap sending 14 times many tankers hydrogen truck stops support remotely reasonable, don‚Äôt stand scrutiny ignored. At point significant bias hydrogen claim it‚Äôs required competitive.But challenges model well. Autonomous trucking autonomous platooning freight trucks foregone conclusion, even promised delivery timetables slipped. That‚Äôs going inevitable downward pressure required rest stops. And automated loading unloading tractors depots putting downward pressure time available truck receiving discharging load. However, given energy costs electric trucking much lower diesel even without pricing carbon, I see operational optimization exercise, one I every faith logistics expertise trucking firms resolve.Cebon I spoke another alternative favors I consider less likely necessary, putting overhead trolley wires lanes heavy trucking routes adding extensible connectors ‚Äî pantographs ‚Äî top semi tractors. This completely technically viable, century old technology used buses, trolleys heavy trains globally would enable semis run grid electricity charge batteries periods highway. And it‚Äôs entirely possible put range extending generators trucks running biodiesel really odd circumstances.There‚Äôs nothing technically difficult options, it‚Äôs likely used places interim solutions high speed chargers high-energy density batteries everywhere.Is real world evidence support massive electrification trucking? Yes, is. China 500,000 electric trucks roads already adding daily. Meanwhile rounding error numbers trucks hydrogen alternatives batteries electric motors. The test run. Battery electric won.The USA‚Äôs transportation blueprint hydrogen strategy based broken assumptions bad faith efforts justify hydrogen, driven large part Congress forcing authors give US fossil fuel industry future. Similar problems exist Europe, intending build massive hydrogen pipeline effort assuming hydrogen shipped ports like Rotterdam use transportation heating applications.But efforts perpetuate hydro hydrocarbon crash shoals physics economics, Scylla Charybdis hydrogen energy. Just everything else, future trucking electric.[removed]That\'s bs. Why trucks haul heavy batteries everywhere. Every kg/lb matters.It\'s gonna LNG, better diesel engines electric power lines like trains now. Every energy systems place somewhere.[removed]not solve issues charging cold reduce mileage cold.This wrong. California leading charge nationwide electric trucks said cannot increase gross vehicle weight limit beyond 82,000lbs would make thousands bridges off-limits, essentially stopping truck cargo moving. Frito lay Pepsi light cargos. Chips non-dense sodas lightest use-cases industry chosen pilot programs.Most food commodities heavy, pushing maximum allowable gross weight every single load. A battery electric hydrogen truck weighs average 8-10,000lbs conventional diesel. This makes effective cargo weights lowered 25%, means trucks road, expensive basic food commodities, strain power grid already cannot support California‚Äôs needs.Even someone wanted convert right electric trucks, major players like PGE giving 5+ year build outs private charging trucking, demand comes get worse. For small companies 1-5 trucks park third party lots don‚Äôt access charging, basically 0 public charging infrastructure built.When technology charging infrastructure improves, maybe possibility, far easy currently close.

When someone purchasing ticket ""locking"" one process select seats, check options, enter payment details etc, finishes process stays ""locked"". Question many open processes allow, oversell tickets.A couple reasons. One reason server load. A thousand millions people refreshing page shows spot queue heavy server thousands millions people constantly refreshing seat availability chart example.It also makes easier deal availability.Say 1,000 tickets sale. 700 people login time want purchase 2 tickets. As picking seats (but purchased) going enough availability. If take first 1,000 seats selected (but purchased) going appear sold out. But maybe bunch people decide complete purchase want change seats.. Now seats suddenly available again. If count seats available actually purchased lot people selecting seats going process get final payment step seats available anymore.If instead make queue people given certain amount time select seats complete purchase, next person seats reliably shown sold available (depending previous person completed purchase timed out, etc)Your website may able handle millions requests time, third party systems like payment provider maybe not. Also, scaling handle millions requests quite expensive. Even use serverless cloud approach, still expensive fire lot whole application. If event limited amount tickets available, need scale everything.At last, also business usability aspect. For events, ticket reversed past queue. It\'s really dick move give someone change buy ticket, last moment refuse soled out.On IIS 5000 requests per CPU max, however server setup there\'s always limit. These tickets companies going prepare huge ticket sellout, cuz it\'d costly.If million request buy ticket time probably something wrong. Apart problem mostly able choose sit.because waiting turn.Better introduce capacity queue site fall over.I like lego turn releases, I\'ve seen two Star Wars events appreciate it, even autoscaling resouces intimate spreading load key time slots great planning stops system failing. All well implimented.for things like really question many requests per second webserver handlethe request rates particular actions get throttled prevent mainly prevent issues duplicateseg 2 people buying ticket/other limited itemsServers able handle workload excactly why. And sometimes even application make sense even servers handle it. Let\'s say cinema 100 seats. When person logs shown free seats choose from. They check partner sit takes minutes. What there\'s thousand people same. Once deceided seats selected others snatched they\'ll longer free. Which starts process (if there\'s even seats left)Spacing customers lets us make sure ones let far better experience. Building booking systems complex takes bunch iterations. The stakes high users there\'s overs since relevant traffic usually hours.Okey, argentinian example make clear. Imagine corralito, everybody wanted retrieve money banks banks enough resources everything collapsed. This pretty much same: everyone wants connect access resources once, web server incapable handle requests go shit. That\'s put (well, lot of, case tickets) users hold server able process request. There methods aliviate this, like proxy servers on.Depending scenario could server resources, could external resources.Say big online game releasing, they\'re going estimating many servers need. If they\'re mark many server resources need, they\'re paying anyway. If they\'re mark control user load everyone bad time. And even best auto-scaling going respond fast herd wild users go. So limit behind queue things get questionable.The bit things like online stores matter fast website is, control fast slow ones work need deliver correct responses regardless long waiting guys. Say store, they\'re probably backed ERP(Enterprise resource planning) system payment system. ERPs notoriously slow pain work with, get right entry shop job right inventory generally limits may possible properly retry later. Payment systems used way, still are, customer world wants blindly re-trying credit card try get faster, boss world wants provide service without someone paying it.

The list long...MongoDB .populate() I aware of. You use ODM like Mongoose using schemas take away flexibility NoSQL database.ORMs/ODMs trade performance ease use abstraction. There plenty SQL based ORMs also make really easy get relational data without JOINs abstracted away may performant.When working lot relational information SQL database going much faster. NoSQL definitely strengths much better choice SQL certain use cases complex relational data one strengths.Not join syntax. But also foreign key integrity, Amount data update change data. You didn‚Äôt mention transactions. Most tests inclined punish opposite technology. You allowed use RDBMS non-RDBMS app. If need integrity - pick sql. If need availability - pick noSQL. You complicated structure? - use both. Meanwhile I‚Äôm using Postgres, Dynamo one project 10 years. Just pick combine whatever fits better needs requirements.If gut feeling mongo might comparable performance traditional SQL databases totally try run benchmarks! It could make pretty interesting blog post.FWIW I look bit found article couple years ago comparisons: https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/comparison-joins-mongodb-vs-postgresql looks like Postgres least lot faster joins mongo.The hacker news thread also contains useful context author: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22834036It doesn‚Äôt look like used populate method, I‚Äôm familiar mongo sure would meaningful impact performance.One thing stands gives Postgres bit leg mongo fact query planner change strategy it‚Äôs using depending underlying data. I suspect complex queries Postgres perform mongo result. This intuition though! I could wrong since I haven‚Äôt run numbers myself, disagree, totally try see find!I\'ve used MongoDb past, I\'m exclusively using Postgres (for reason tends cover 90% use cases I have). That said answer questions, joins different, referential integrity.In MongoDb emulate join lookup (which I presume populate using) way express constraint ""row collection x must exist row collection Y exists"". You need either model kinds constraints application put everything one document.Regarding performance, using populate client issue N queries MongoDb populate resulting N round trips Database. In case od rational database JOIN done database server returned back you, I expect would faster.It comes expected throughput - 1 query per second worry probably matter use. Of need service 1000qps might totally different story.People say data relational, use relational database document database. That because, surprise, relational databases designed ground work relational data.Document databases hand designed dump bunch semistructured data disk.Of course use document database store query relational data, primary design goal many ways, subpar job.For example RDBMs, database takes care referential integrity, document database, that\'s job clients.A major reason denormalizing data data deduplication data consistency. RDBMs good enforcing constraints data, document database job job clients.Which faster? Depends entirely workload. NoSQL databases operate little integrity checks, typically perform raw data writes fast. Then again, similar speeds often achieved RDBMs loosening integrity requirements.Which readable? Personally, I find SQL much readable vendor specific NoSQL query language.MongoDB pipelines especially atrocious imho.I find semi-structured documents less organized tables.I tried use MongoDB sizable personal project experience similar peeing pants. What started warm pleasant pretty soon turned cold wet mess.But everything like this, there\'s law saying can\'t it.I\'m big Mongodb user fair bit consultation directly large project workMy experience joining mongodb necessarily slow, altho I\'d say almost certainly slower postgres example.However, one use case truly way slower need query collection joining - lose indexes collection, need to, example, join users collection orders collection return users order date greater X, going really slow (assuming reasonable amounts data)\\ [ removed \\ ]I agree people saying here:BUT big one:Mongo + mongoose easy change migrate REAL benefits using lot different types systems, even relational data.Also speed thing confusing. It true joins faster SQL, account way structure DB.You definitely structure mongo way relational requires significantly less joins tables (collections mdb case)I\'ve worked SQL mongodb lot I agree technically SQL may ""solid"" ""performant"" certain common scenarios. There also level freedom I really value mongodb really allows make really quick changes data.Now said, software engineers truly bad jobs lol. We fucking suck keeping things well architected organized whole. The speed change MDB allows SQL also footgun. Many many folks shot footgun careful MDB use time things became messy, slow, data became incomplete crappy. It\'s lot harder sql.At end day, tradeoff systems strengths weaknesses, I really like MDB small projects, startups, apps may need make rapid pivots changes SQL, EVEN IF THE DATA IS RELATIONAL.Good luck data efforts may always cling respective dogmas may fight wars future.Relational data getting relational data. It\'s also deleting nullifying them.Readability subjective.Regarding performance compared relational DBs:Using `populate()` populating fields documents collections slower joins relational database `populate()` done client. In short, query (e.g. `find({ _id: \'xxx\' }).populate(\'myField\')`), first needs get ""root document"" _id. Once done, send another query getting subdocument. This done 2 steps client library needs get ID `myField` sending query getting it.So, pay network latency 2 times instead 1.This get even worse need populate multiple levels (e.g. `find({ _id: \'xxx\' }).populate({ field: \'myField\', populate: [\'mySubSubField\'])` - I remember exactly populate syntax)Note also that, find = 1 query, populate another query. So, use Mongo highly relational data, could potentially send 10+ ""real queries"" one ""find + populates"".Mongo pipelines, hand, executed DB. But others mentioned, hard reason about. Performance-wise, better way, everything DB, everything executed sequentially. So, multiple stages, overall duration stage1 + stage2 + stage3 + ... There\'s parallelism/concurrency I know.Actually, lot stages, populate() faster send ""level 1 populate queries"" parallel.But, mentioned others, best run benchmarks yourselfHere\'s simplified mental map you. In increasing order relation complexity.Relations type : DB type1-to-1 : Your standard key-value store. Think simple JS object, Redis.1-to-many : Similar above, store multiple values key. Think JS object storing arrays key.hierarchical (variation 1-to-many) : It\'s tree data structure. Your document DB, mongodb. Each node\'s relation parent child. You drive relationship b/w cousin nodes via parent nodes. But directly related.many-to-many : Your SQL DBs. You know this.graph (variation many-to-many) : You define complex relationship. Think social networks.TLDR: It\'s MongoDB (not NoSQL) can\'t relations. It\'s limited design simple relationship. If relationship, usually means many-to-many. You always go SQL. Unless complex relationship graph DBs make sense.MongoDB engineers tell joins last resort Mongo. The DB engine storage format aren‚Äôt built support efficiently. SQL DBs typically built ground fast joins.once data set hits certain size queries actually become complex, you‚Äôll notice huge difference relational queries. rather basic queries prob wouldn‚Äôt noticed difference.I really want see backend server logic looks like.Populate() native feature MongoDB provided Mongoose simplify process working related data.

It comes client first sees response body requests page site.For CSR, usually empty HTML page client run javascript render page, hence ""client-side rendering"", let client render page instead. This (was) bad SEO search engines indexing site run javascript check HTML content, see empty document, can\'t usually ranking site based content. However, seems like search engines somewhat helped solve running scripts unknown limits, giving chance page render fully. But problem really know effective actually is, there\'s chance content might fully load leading broken pages.SSR hand, renders page server, means builds HTML server first sends response. This proper way create dynamic pages back SPAs exist javascript considered dummy language. The reason good SEO response body already rendered content, meaning client run javascript get content unlike CSR.One thing SSG (static-site generation), name method create/build pages build-time. Instead building HTML ""on-demand"" (for every request), create files build-time, serve plain old HTML.For Astro framework, could methods, could configure method want (SSR SSG) page level, also CSR/hydration component level. By default, Astro use SSG whole site tell Astro components render client. For 11ty, SSG.This whole ‚ÄúSSR‚Äù ‚ÄúCSR‚Äù weird me, I wish people wouldnt use terms seems frequently lead muddled understanding web works.There ‚Äústatic content‚Äù (plain old HTML files, unrendered) ‚Äúdynamic content‚Äù (HTML rendered backend scripts, probably meant ‚ÄúSSR‚Äù, people seem conflate two)There also pages assembled frontend framework, JS creates DOM fly (what probably meant CSR).

Good SEO generally product well formed document structure predictable responses document fetched.

But prevalence frontend frameworks. I imagine capable degree?It doesn‚Äôt really matter process use generate content, matters delivered user end.An easy way test this: curl request URL one pages see get back. If content there, conventional. If content partially skeleton document, requires JS finish assembling document.Meh site full csr shows top Google lolAstro eleventy ship fully-baked HTML user. That great SEO benefits.Eleventy framework per-se, like build tool generating files make website. Eleventy stuff dev environment, nothing build site. This SSG (static site generation).Astro work way (generate 100% static site), also run server dynamically create webpages on-demand. This SSR (server-side rendered)These often compared CSR (client-side rendered) apps usually built react/vue/angular/svelte/etc. These apps powerful terms state management UI reactivity, power comes cost performance. With CSR framework, get past white screen downloaded/parsed/executed js. That puts hard performance ceiling CSR apps.The big win SSG SSR is: shipping fully-baked HTML CSS client. This means crawlers whole HTML doc accessible index, users get high performance immediately get markup style without waiting js bundle download/parse/execute.Nowadays, makes difference website updates quickly often, like Multiple times day (think News-Sites, high volume E-Commerce). Then SSR good quicker indexing Google.For static sites apps won‚Äòt make big difference. It might impact performance-wise, depending initial loading-times.In opinion (as somebody built countless SPAs) relying SSR choose teck-stack good render engine (no SPAs ajax loading)SSR nutshell workaround javascript take care whole View rendering logic.

How young kid compete that.Eh it\'ll mostly richest us first 50-100 years.It going reality (for wider public)We\'ll starve death. The thing keeping population control dying.About 61 million people died last year, compared 134 million born. Without deaths population go roof.This especially true fertility extended older women. That would increase birth rate well.Read Peter F Hamilton\'s books. He deep dives stuff.Another alternative could possibly circumvent huge negative impact semi immortality would necessary commodities, food, clean drinking water, housing, transportation, notion uploading onto mainframe computer, digitizing minds. But would also open whole big new virtual worms.It depends probably poorly. If humans live longer could result stagnation since older generations dying off. That means younger people would wait get better jobs get places power.Career prospects nosedive. Senior positions large organizations largely occupied 100yo workaholics. This skew potential career path younger professionals.Birthrate limits gradually applied world. Genetical improvement newer generations need come place. Not much terms boosting certain traits, making sure genetic diseases passed down.

Netflix\'s love death robots explores one episodes, wherein society extremely dystopian unregistered births death sentence caught. Essentially elites keep draconian laws place ensure population get hand.Now limited space/resources might see something like world\'s portrayed Commonwealth saga Peter F Hamilton. Not long first successful rejuvenation treatment announced, wormhole technology discovered gave humanity abundance new worlds resources expand with, easing overpopulation fears humanity whole. Both fun explore, anyone\'s guess way we\'ll actually go society.we would definitely need term limits political positionsThe first aspect I would consider cost individual procedures.Financial cost: expensive rich ones benefit. I see people suggesting businesses would pay would pay back work decades I simply don‚Äôt see business committing decades long relationship anyone individual could simply go bankrupt void debt. They also would never want people working power fire someone necessity case need scapegoat.The lifestyle cost: present vast lists things person could increase lifespan average, reduce numerous health risks including dementia risk. In practice, people many interventions I cannot say I met/heard anyone all. That partly due lifestyle factors cannot controlled (e.g. hours spent working can‚Äôt home cook whole foods meals fit enough exercise etc). However, equally, rich seem unable meet requirements (though easier eat home made whole foods personal chef). Again, I would say rich would ones would likely benefit control lifestyles.Side effects cost: procedures unpleasant cause distasteful side effects I don‚Äôt think uptake would high many people. We see impact medication side effects limits people can/are willing endure. If causes impotence I can‚Äôt imagine popular all. So, strong desire live extended period time (perhaps sociopaths megalomaniacs) would commit long-term.So, likely wealthy desperate live long would ones access services. Consequently, wealth would become even concentrated hands people.If somehow meaningful costs overpopulation would become urgent issue countries engage likely forced sterilisation birth would required (with births allowed strict circumstances). How would affect psyche population level I don‚Äôt know I imagine would big social impact.In world? Jobs become even harder get fewer people retire employers looking decades experience. Social security either raise benefit age obscenely high number, ended altogether since anyone whos filthy rich expected work forever.Retirement longer exist. Society can\'t everyone nothing productive.Interesting stock market longer path retirement. Hence, stock market behavior change. A company\'s stock grow company grows.Ironically governments billionaires probably actually start giving crap environment, global warming, etc. Since they\'ll know they\'ll probably experience worst well.No matter...earth would eradicate us eventually. Over populating planet like infection. The planet compensate destroy means ""immortality"".I believe immortality never reached extending life span cells could happen. When happen middle high class population probably benefit likely problems today exacerbated e.g. health insurance, corrupt politicians, nepotism, etc.We‚Äôve seen plenty procedures extend improve life. But end day aren‚Äôt built last. Just enjoy today, thread full useless doom gloom.The moment real life extension even biological immortality become available, wealthiest access first - change world.The common attitude among wealthy, issues like climate change pollution never affect them, long dead end. They still alive, deal reality yes, affected. They affected. They suffer. And instantly make fixing issues important priority earth.Always bet selfishness, always bet personal interest.If want save ecology planet, make wealthy control everything live centuries, millennia. In moment, long term planning matters. In moment livable climate truly matters. In moment protecting earth finally matters.Because live deal it, definitely want that.The wealthiest powerful forced become immortal. Forced face actions still alive worst happens. That see real change protecting environment.Rich people would live longer accumulate power extended period time.Elysium maybe? The rich immortal, poor (more) disposable.Rapamycin exists today yet nothing changed far.For one, ever allowed trickle common folks, would probably require sterilization exchange offered people don‚Äôt already kids. As much harp global population now, growing, near immortal population would nightmare scenario elites.Social security fucked.

The solution trivial, stop treating housing like speculative market. The fact politicians respond understand issue, understand quite clear. The apathy design.In Canada, least, partly due boomer NIMBYs across local councils refusing change zoning increase urban density. Our parents could afford house two cars raise three children one income; possible us they\'re sitting top hill throwing convenient rationalizations like ""just stop eating avocados"" simultaneously making almost impossible uphill slog get there. Humans naturally protect benefits assets they\'ve accrued.The country partially solved issue Singapore: 80% population lives cheap public housing.As tiny country limited space, proves current housing crisis technical issue, purely political one others mentioned.I think near term, life going get painful, long term going see real estate collapse. Right now, huge incentives ever increasing home prices.Home owners want increasing home prices, landlords want increasing home prices, local governments want increasing home prices, real estate agents (the NAR among highest spending lobbying) want high home prices. So long fixed home stand make money high real estate costs YOU very, big incentive housing get far expensive. These large people run local governments.If housing costs doubled, would good lot people. And people charge policy. Its extremely common city council members landlords oppose building project, financial incentives so. By limiting construction, supply remains low, demand remains high, rent collect investment properties remains high! You many people, people generally money, common incentive make housing expensive possible. These people issue using government achieve goals. Government helping NOT socialism. Its good business makes money!We need enormous amounts housing high demand areas jobs are. Not 2 hours away jobs expect people drive 40,000 miles per year commute. I Southern California city called Riverside, commuter city Los Angeles Orange County. LA/OC well paying jobs every day 30,000 people city make hour+ drive go drive work. Living LA/OC home cost million (and fancy home). A comparable home Riverside cost $600,000. If can\'t afford million dollar home, whole commute thing. You go much east find something $450,000 looking least 3 hours driving day.\u200bHere optimism. Location important thing. Locations high paying jobs like Silicon Valley (where I now) extremely expensive. However, witnessing early stages remote work revolution. COVID accelerated several years, going happen anyway due technical improvements. We yet see first wave major startups built around remote work force vs requiring employees move live expensive area country. This eliminates geography major advantage certain markets have. People able get high paying job living anywhere want.I really think rural markets small towns cute downtown centers going use leverage. Make place really great live attract remote workers. Someone making $100,000 per year, good San Francisco, someone making $100,000 per year small town Indiana, good! Especially person already Indiana really want move.Another one affect housing supply high demand areas transition Self Driving Taxis private cars. The big thing, land downtown used parking repurposed high density mixed use. Tony Seba ReThinkX estimated took parking lots City Los Angeles, area freed would 3 times size San Francisco. The land parking lots currently use could house 2+ million people San Francisco density (San Francisco parks way...) . As I mentioned, I live commuter city, real estate prices justified local wages, commuters. Plop housing 800,000 households, make cheaper Riverside pricing, commuters move close work.I going kind bring back home...Downtown Riverside 30% parking infrastructure. If people using RoboTaxis get around, land used parking becomes obsolete, owners land would make far money developed high density mixed use development. Downtown Land owners want turn Downtown 2 acre block something would make largest possible income them, going high density, mixed use. Throw dozen shops/offices, 450 housing units going make absolute fortune. Letting valuable land sit vacant great way make money.We even worst area. About half Downtown San Bernardino used parking. Some developers going figure building massive amounts urban development area going make lot money, especially nature design make much safer surrounding area.\u200bSmall towns America surprisingly quite large. They spread poorly developed. They huge gaps destinations. They enormous amounts land used parking. There 16,000 small towns America. Turn central downtown area 2,000 housing units (going high density fit 20 acres) would 32,000,000 housing units popping country.

RoboTaxis show Des Moines demand excess parking going drop sharply. Turning area cool urban area bring hundreds thousands people.Right now, last several decades. Residents compete gets live communities. Governments attract residents. That could quickly change incentive structure could become one local governments compete residents, residents bring tax revenue. If remember several years ago, Amazon announced going build HQ2 asked local governments bids. The local governments wanted high paying jobs city (even local labor, lot tax revenue economic activity).

Materials probably bit, enough drive price increase. Simply put, issue building expensive. It\'s securing site first place expensive, gets expensive people stuff chasing amount space.Nobody ""makes"" sites. They make buildings sites, sites. And yet, whole class owner makes money sites, value anything added site even considered.This money ""existence tax"", privately owned, privately collected. There way make go away. But could collected distributed population per capita basis. If done, matter expensive housing became. The expensive housing (assuming site value expense), money land value tax would take in, larger distribution would become.Maybe exempt existing homeowners certain number years (primary residence, only), we\'re harming people put savings equity (particularly retired people dependent home own). But new homeowners, increase expense owning home. Rather, tax would capitalized price, bringing up-front cost (both principle interest), keeping total cost ownership roughly same.Owners multiple properties mortgage lenders would hate this.The solution tax land labour. It perfect policy. They won‚Äôt it.Investment gets pitched us solution problem reality drives demand. Until investment gets banned prices keep going nobody afford even rent.Capitalism beautiful lie, comforts people think live beyond means. ""Other people\'s money"" reality banks money sooner later cash out.Housing unproductive asset yet used investment. We feeling effects years years capital allocation towards unproductive housing investments instead productive enterprise.If someone wants get loan (aka newly created money fresh money printer), easiest way get home loan. We system people try get biggest loans buy finite resources rent people. It zero sum game, someone win, someone else lose.There also numerous fiscal policy choices governments make behest donors encourage housing investment keep bubble going.If really want fix problem root, all, switching hard currency would trick. Alternatively fiscal policy changes make housing less attractive investment also work, example, increase property taxes reduce income taxes.I suggest reading georgism. It system tax collected land value tax.

The primary reason dealt quickly prices shoot restrictive zoning.Most progressives give emotionally charged answer that\'s muddled combination ""hedge funds"" ""gentrification greed"", look data inability build homes high enough rate demand highest (because restrictive ""community focused"" zoning) primary issue.Ironically, restrictively zoned areas country deep blue cities NYC, San Francisco, etc.Short term rentals like Airbnb Brbo gobbled thirty percent supply single family units Hedge funds gobbled another 15 percent rising... unless outlawed short term rentals taxed appropriately worse worse housing crisis everywhere goea unregulated.Supply demand.That‚Äôs it. Everything else layers complexity nonsense top that.I‚Äôm Australia, conversation ridiculous people argue poor logic emotion.We need supply places housing needed.

Like incentives infrastructure upgrades would serve families social structure place.Politicians make worse difficult regulations, profiteering.People NOT ask government provide subsidies - help people raise prices everyone else.It comes whether people make living building new housing. If can‚Äôt, won‚Äôt. They profit it, deserve so.There countries exact opposite problem - diminishing populations making entire towns vacant.It comes living areas afford it. There birthright living want. Humans nomads history. Should even easier nowadays remote working opportunities.It\'s generally politicians jobs like run banking housing markets. It\'s short term housing crisis caused pandemic, rather rapid rise wages, ppl getting used normal interest rates vs historically low interest rates 2008 housing crisis, climate change driving housing costs regions. So I would consider long term future problem much. Climate change get quite bit worse, automation also continuously drive cost production , commodities cost living general. Population rising significantly slower production going away I think long-term problem.Raising wages answer... They raise price everything around it.Greed. This design.

There need upper 1% world population fortune lower half population! It\'s immoral, unethical, harmful. They spend money anyway otherwise. They keep high standards living even half fortune, quarter, tenth.In opinion top limit fortune single person possess. Every additional penny must go taxman.Close tax havens! Also establish worldwide financial transaction tax.In words: distribute wealth fairly! Make pay fair share! That would solve lot problems. Maybe even worldwide housing crisis.Housing crisis complex multilayer. Energy scarcity needs fixed first.When there‚Äôs replacement population fill buildings houses that‚Äôs drop politicians greed NEVER stopBecause existing residents want homes built area.Housing shortages simple, documented, studied, problem known solution.Rent control penalties landlords anti+displacement measures solve housing shortage.One reason: If turn regular house luxury house increase profit that\'s focus investors. There\'s enough incentive invest affordable housing.Another reason, fall public housing stock percentage housing. Housing brackets used diverse within suburbs becoming one bracket eg everyone socio economic class less pockets diversity. With less diversity there\'s less innovationIt‚Äôs probably going become worse. Landlords find ways fix prices using sophisticated technological methods exist right now.Housing market needs far better regulated. Like selling foreigners use investment purposes.

The answer yes assuming cable Cat5e device gigabit ethernet port.What download speeds get? What WiFi version have? Is WiFi 6?What ""wifi box""?Bandwidth (how much raw data transferred per second) limited slowest connection two points. So say downloading game Steam, data might go Valve server Valve\'s ISP, ISP ISP, ISP modem/router, router PC. Let\'s say Valve 1000 Mega bit per second internet, ISPs 1,000,000Mbps link them, 500 Mbps 5G internet.Scenario 1: WiFi router PC gives 300 Mbps. Then max bandwidth 300 Mbps since that\'s slowest link chain.Scenario 2: You move PC closer router, surprise, WiFi gives 800Mbps! But, internet connection still limited 500 Mbps internet, that\'s max bandwidth slowest link.With scenario 1, changing WiFi Ethernet would improve max bandwidth. With scenario 2, wouldn\'t. So Ethernet usually higher bandwidth WiFi, whether improves maximum bandwidth depends whether WiFi bottleneck, internet connection (or something chain, like server downloading from).However, bandwidth factor determining ""connection strength"" called it.Packet loss another issue. Some types connection reliable others. Ethernet uses shielded cable send information electrical signals, generally speaking much data loss. WiFi sends information using radio waves, anything walls microwaves planet Earth interfere signals. Packet loss much higher. The packets get lost, frequently retransmitted. So even WiFi theoretically send packet data really fast, end result - download speed - great resend packets 3, 4 dozen times. This accounts biggest difference ""theoretical maximum bandwidth"" WiFi, actual time takes transfer file certain size.Latency yet another issue. Where download speed many data packets reach per second, latency long takes packet reach request it. This another area WiFi loses. Because radio waves prone interference, there\'s lot complicated work happens transmit receive reliably. A lot checking double checking confirming receipt on. Not mention work involved physically converting electrical signals computer radio waves back again. Since 5G also uses radio waves, problem. And issue is, unlike bandwidth basically slowest link, latency cumulative. So WiFi 12ms latency, added 20ms latency 5G connection, 3ms ISP Valve\'s ISP, 1ms Valve\'s server ISP.So even bandwidth equal, latency make internet experience feel worse. But flip side, also means improving latency one connections (realistically, one control WiFi) improve overall latency. So really depends exactly mean ""connection strength"" (latency, bandwidth, both?) biggest bottlenecks are.']"

There enormous spike researching LLMs, I believe take long even single-eval LLMs reach 10% together searches ala muzero, GPT-f, AlphaGeometry might become order magnitude better.Not replaced. No. As manager devs though, I expect devs understand leverage things like CoPilot productive.genius !!It\'s great tool, idea it, context matters.Huh, apparently need researcher Princeton know obvious.Was article written AI?I think mental model non-programmer programming something along lines ""you take statement I gave English translate directly funny code computer"". If take one ""intro python"" course pretty much would feel like. As though skill knowing language basic translation. And LLM surely trick reasonably well, I suppose guess need programmer anymore.But I think reality, least good programmers, understand domain technology, build model technology solves domain problems supports domain activities. At least according Naur ""Programming Theory Building"", job. Importantly, much theory Naur talking tacit - something that\'s code, hard capture documentation too.I believe current generations LLMs theory world (or domain it) code relates them. I\'m sure AI someday able that. But point, every job also replaced. Almost tautologically, people express domain theories computer last ones job, task replace jobs.Anytime soon? I guess next version chatgpt it.Aside making productive means either given work less people hired. Nobody going pay less work.No shit ‚Ä¶..I agree conclusion programmers can‚Äôt replaced now.

Sometimes difficult problems need done, times boring stuff needs done.Jobs fluctuate, problem difficulties change, that‚Äôs lot good engineers hop around; get bigger bigger challenges. Some others, like me, like challenge internal problems try solve those. I got bored built scraping tool I could keep database recent car models company ul date. I got even bored built configurable web builder. Was shitty? Yes, I learned lot. How I balance it? I either didn‚Äôt explicitly asked manager time complete project.And days I felt like master, others I felt like complete idiot. I find it‚Äôs common experience dev especially tend learn unlearn things much much frequently professions.Also, writing code =\\= getting better. Some engineers memorize, don‚Äôt think. If start feel problem repetitive way solved, find compelling problem either moving jobs. That I feel, fastest way ‚Äúlearn‚Äù.I‚Äôm really sorry shitty write I hope helps.being job year boot camp much time all. what‚Äôs tough junior set boundaries. who‚Äôs genius told grace period over? takes years pick craft seriously position judge good programmer.Keep. Going.Your employer provide time resources learn order improve company\'s codebase.New programmers often misconception knowing programming language important and, extension, writing code job. The best devs get value largely engineering...From deciding code write write, carefully maintaining dependencies, keeping project consistent good standards, collecting right requirements stakeholders, etc. What takes junior senior dev largely knowing programming languages writing code, stuff.So, I\'d say hit plateau writing much code, maybe pick book software engineering, software design, algorithms, computer security, database design, etc. Focus less language code knowledge process system design.Read books fundamentals already mentioned, thoroughly read language framework documentation start grok actually happening hood.Start identify tickets repetitive, could make work easier (refactoring, writing adding tools scripts). Nibble away time.By year 2 deeper knowledge writing good code, understand tools working with, bullet points resume want look new job lack mentor advancement.I think multiple approaches improving dev. Some free time, effective company time. Once get past grace period ""learning job"" / getting anything done, next step figure learn still getting shit done. Nicer places work build extra time, shitty places add buffer work get time.Is copy pasted crap actually best way build things? Often copy pasted crap cargo culted legacy garbage one bothers fix understand. Learning ins outs stack probably next best way advance (unless want specific job different stack). Do understand best practices docker, graphql, sql, vue(vite)? How ORM interface/bridge layers? Is particular area better? Are things org funny? Do understand why? How resilient particular choice changes requirements future?You gotta choose want general knowledge domain knowledge. The 1st better getting new jobs. The 2nd better succeeding current job. Being good makes valuable.Is first job? If so, give time. You\'ll feel comfortable experience.The ""greenfield"" project always exciting, always be.But energy learning / side projects work (and definitely alone that), suggestion would see get paid training time work. A lot companies now. It\'s even better tie training something would benefit project work.It\'s not: ""hey boss, I\'d like learn random new shit, I clock?"" (although companies fine this, great way sell it)It\'s more: ""hey boss, I think I learned bit [insert subject matter], could really help us [insert relevant technical issue / planned feature / maintenance etc]. Is okay I carve time Friday afternoons study this? I\'ve good job getting tickets done far I think could really help team.""Good luck!Horizontal investment: learn ruby rails, django, react, svelte.Vertical investment: learn nosql dbs, cap theorem, infrastructure, architecture.When felt like plateauing knowledge django, tried go deeper go wider web development. Nothing ever best thing get exposure lot different things, slowly understand even bigger picture webdev. It\'s beautiful.What experiencing normal. Keep going, find new things improve day, feel another wave progress soon!Personally I picked analysis implementation, integration, deployment, validation stuff got easy. Systems analysis, use cases, data flows interfaces. So applying power/influence stakeholder analysis, writing user stories first principles, designing cucumber test cases, diagrammatic data flows, defining applicable security controls/standards, UML. I perform analysis part investigation ticket, implement I\'ve analysed it.It improved software development immensely, almost like breathing technique martial artists.I suggestion improve continuing use chat.Receive ticket, plan think/ would solve identifying concepts involved documentation. Then throw chat, reverse engineer chat\'s response, close thinking? As challenge try prove chat\'s code conceptually wrong. If wrong fully understand get via reverse engineering, attempt refactoring -if plausible- implement. If chat\'s code wrong, give try. Refine using chat docs needed.Reasoning approach: You save time process attempting two paths once. You plan, chat plan, collaborate plans. You also get opportunity practice code review, studying documentation/ refactoring attempts gain practice knowledge.This approach using chat I feel less like I\'m ""spinning wheels mud"" like I\'m improving.Use ChatGPT learning. Ask explain code; use asking. I\'ve coding long time I find extremely usefulWelcome work. It\'s like school.Hope helpsGolden rule: You never reach senior level things work. You constantly improve outside working hours, learn things, read etc.Are literally complaining copying pasting ChatGPT StackOverflow feel like hit plateau? I mean copying pasting shit, creating something new, what\'s learn? Don\'t that.This something many people get, regardless they\'re coming bootcamp not: You\'re make money company. The daily work feel like chore, times fighting legacy code written others bare minimum make things work deadlines running, etc.You HAVE invest free time, especially new. You cannot expect work exciting things day job, rate technologies/frameworks change affect job market there, company there.For instance, projects .NET Framework jQuery, ZERO Angular/React/Vue projects. The job market moves towards .NET Core/.NET separate frontend frameworks. It makes corporate sense rewrite everything modern technologies, makes sense developer learn what\'s currently popular.Focus quality code rather quantity. There lots ways level solely focusing assigned tasks.Would better centralize code rather copy/paste it? Do truly understand code pasting/generating? Are following common standards conventions languages/frameworks using? Do linter installed, made red yellow squiggly lines go away? Does code get reviewed? Does code get tested?how long grace period?Having invested interest problem solution huge starting grasp instead chasing work.If passion personal projects work spare time, serve spring ahead faster developing someone elseI masters CS, lot year experience I work big tech. It\'s exactly thing. In addition that, problem stuck with, there\'s ALWAYS another person half hour.One thing true though, hard grow professionally stuck OE work. Fixing tickets skill skills must neglected.Is option put extra hours side project, extracurricular classesIt\'s true overwhelming majority good devs I know. You play around things spare time, learn lucky, may use work.Is project ""maintenance"" project, ""build"" one ? ( sorry, I\'m sure english terms )What I mean say I find interesting work projects starting ( build type ), well evolving existing projects already large written code base ( maintenance ). Both allow us gain different skills help us improve different ways.Maybe like switch different type project, maybe need move ambitious complex projects (e.g. e-commerce, simply high-traffic sites? ) different would let see things.But working place handles one project, necessarily going possible sadly.When there\'s bug live version project, help debugging? Or leads developpers take care ? Because looking finding solutions emergencies nice skill grow.Would able manage project everyone suddenly absent while? Would able handle tickets ? Do know understand deployment process project?If not, maybe help figure topics delve into, least ones related project, broaden knowledge.this common feeling lot advanced learning, feeling hitting wall. thing keep pushing, guess could quit wouldnt recommend that.ChatGPT kind cool cause ask explain stuff post large parts project ask explain recommend improvements.I sometimes assembly line boring code work like way I make interesting trying innovate refactor space ChatGPT pretty good helping give ideas stuff. Sometimes really turn anything still fun explore.Other that, people like hear this, job hopping. Switch jobs around every two years get pay bump greater ever staying one place keep getting learning periods getting exposed new systems.Is option put extra hours side project, extracurricular classes?When I junior I basically constantly coding, work. I personal / side projects I would work, sometimes I would bring work home work it. I also getting challenging problems I found interesting, work, though.Your skill grow high need to, challenged work, want impose challenge externally.\u200bmost I reworked copy/paste code elsewhere codebase, stack overflow, ChatGPT.Stop copypasta, esp ChatGPT, start writing scratch, even takes little longer. You\'re denying learning opportunities.\u200bI want good dev, senior dev one day.Does company path improvement / career development? If room grow, move elsewhere. 2-3 years pretty standard industry, unreasonable move onwards feel stopped growing.Not wanting program work pretty normal. Especially current work sometimes exhausting personal life busy.Also, code camps like prototypes build 90% code 10% time continue would write 10% code 90% time. Its always nice bother unit tests code quality need regular work make guarantees quality work specifications need implement.Prototypes kind ""trust bro"" whereas work creates professional work feel proud (or least accomplished). But also feel like (perhaps boss let you, get enough time finish many deadlines) might time look elsewhere position make feel accomplished gives good feeling created.Also, point hackathon stuff side projects offer less fulfillment make learn less less since knowledge grows point need side projects stay game enough knowledge project new tech gets thrown you, able work matter days/hours/minutes.

That\'s slow keep civilization running run massive timelines matter clever united are. Still, I think time line bit pessimistic given technological gains we\'ve seen last hundred years.What mean destroy?Blowing planet like movies impossible. Gravity way strong.But! We already destroy world many times hydrogen that\'s mean. Or use biological weapon destroy Earth\'s population.A seconds? Never, sterilize surface moment, big ball rock lava, take days ablate.We make bombs 100 thousand times powerful Hiroshima, 1 gigaton TNT... Its enough crater trigger supervolcano chamberd maybe.

They guessing based everyone else doing.Future Headlines: ""Job Cuts Too Deep; Companies Facing Growth Challenges"" ""How Lean Is Too Lean?""Facebook hired thousands people immediate work do. I\'ve heard stories Facebook employees getting hired laid without ever put active project.No punishment executives ""overcorrected"" ""overhired"", course.I\'m even saying lay-offs inherently wrong. If companies longer need employees, makes sense eliminate jobs.But people charge wasted company\'s money incorrectly foreseeing future overhiring first place get punished either. And that\'s I issue with.Being leaner also burns employees creates turnoverFrankly, I issue company wanting lean efficient.I issue though cut many people teams overwhelmed. Suddenly there\'s understaffing everywhere people stressing simply told swallow else there\'s plenty people willing take jobs less money.I issue companies purely please shareholders really reason. Yes, I know shareholders invested, make everything always shareholders, companies surprised get loyalty one willing go beyond them.I also deep issue kinds cuts kind underhanded tactic give power employers. To create artificial levels job scarcity. So everybody scared stop asking remote working privileges shorter work weeks work life balance.It\'s hard really gauge layoffs really necessary underhanded tactics. I also agree others executives going reactive make big mistakes like hiring people work for, executives also chopping block.Like others, I get really tired management seemingly immune consequences actions average people would fired.‚ÄúLean‚Äù three jobs price one, I burn die due stress, hire someone else put pressure fill vacancies. Because company also family.Tech workers understand they\'re equivalent month-to-month apartment lease. It might last years, lasts long useful sides.Every month I get paycheck I say silent ""thanks"" company solvent money bank account. Outwardly, I talk confidently projects start next year, talk. The thing matters end month getting paid work that\'s done.Spoilers. The reason money.Every word comes reptilian looking fucker money. Specifically take pocket put his.they\'re pump stock prices, layoffs increase stock value greater productivity keeping people on. silicon valley also sometimes musical chairs thing one company layoffs, bunch try snap good people laid companiesOne important things realize difference matters company matters people running company. The company get say happens. The people running make calls. For part, interested moral imperative long-term plan. They care next quarter maybe next year.Stock goes stock goes down. The company really benefit much short-term changes. Even longer term trends relevant company\'s day day. You computers workers one day stock 1.3% fewer tools staff next day 2.6% drop. Only significant things company matter w.r.t. stock -- generally undertaken leaders good near-term benefit.Cities pushing get workers back office. They\'re offering incentives. Companies forcing people back office get money. It\'s good way get uptick next quarter\'s earnings. Whether less productive factor it. Nor fact current crisis over, cities going go back charging employment taxes revenue streams many cars/people/whatever commuting city every day.As executive, come board hope stock goes bit more. If believe it\'ll go back up, lower today tomorrow, better. Any near term losses blame predecessor. Then, market turns around stock goes up. Your compensation primarily stock making bank. Plus, resume looks amazing company turn around ""making impact"" -- I mean, creating lot busy work folks learn satisfy demands thing company actually needs survive.You take credit, get great offer even money another company that\'s lull, bounce bad policies insisted actually crumble company. The morale tanks, skilled labor exits, company starts fail... But, already next gig waiting market recover.This jaded perspective. I\'m sure entirely wrong. I think companies whose compensation came form annual dividends paid life company rather stock executive dumps quickly diversify would go long way towards aligning incentives. Maybe executive whose retirement depends company around successful 20 years care tech debt.Until then, good employees care actual company needs, work extra hard long what\'s actually important also trying tick boxes optics, get relatively little return reasons companies make it. When go, company goes.Middle managers everywhere judged promotion hire based upon size organization. Their incentive bloat. Hire, hire, hire. Hire someone who\'s good growing team benefit efforts. Hire folks make arguments sound good get funding. That\'s ticket! Don\'t keep lean organization filled people passionate company knowledgeable needs. That\'ll get nowhere fast.Executives middle managers see company means towards ends. If confused things way are, likely why. You\'re thinking company values goals has. You\'re thinking today, I make boss richer even means destroying everything. That\'s power misaligned incentives. Zuckerberg lays folks balance detrimental effects leaders inherent need grow orgs.Companies realizing that, painful, benefits ""leaner.""So basically Zuckerberg saying is:""I\'m big fan money. I like it, I use it, I lot. I keep giant piles gold coins I like swim through. I\'d like put piles. That\'s layoffs come in.""With apologies Adam Sandler.Nobody world needs Zuck‚Äôs extremely biased interpretation what‚Äôs going on, jfk üôÑImagine much money still haircut.It‚Äôs keep shareholders happy bolster share price.

That\'s approval criticism always work endevour ü§∑\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏èI tried roll initiative start paying developers worked open source libraries company depended on. All engineers I worked (who also extensive experience open source development) viewed heresy purpose open source. They believed people build open source goodness heart, money.I never able convince privileged mindset people opportunity work free. I believed open source devs could use income feel obligated support them, far standard perspective.Dammit, posted 20 years sooner would perfect opportunity promote radiouserland blog.Seriously though everything-old-is-new-again front hot topic early tech blogosphere turn millennium. Since I happen archived copy something topical I posted time handy, maybe interested little time capsule.For context:This around time initial wave Red-Hat-style paid-support approach open-source-for-profit began supplanted community-edition/premium-edition-with-enhanced-features approach. The latter model especially favored closed-source enterprise software vendors, arguably trying cash-in crowdsourced development and/or usurp no-longer-controversial-for-enterprise-deployments open source movement.That is, closed-source vendors first tried push-back open source FUD. When failed shifted ""no one ever chose open source except price"". And failed pivoted toward ""see, we\'re open source too"".The open source community amused, lot discussion time proper way ""pay"" open source development, ethical/moral sense, software quality sense, sense best health sustainability software ecosystem.My point time open source contributions coming people paid contributions, open source projects users software. Those contributors worked companies used software, occasional upstream contribution back project part implicit cost maintenance involved using enterprise software component. (Moreover good thing, since work needed use close-source alternative, harder implement maintain virtually every way.)I\'m sure point valid then. The ecosystem definitely changed many ways, one changes ratio contributors users much lower among many popular projects today - even software library/framework projects - was. (Look etymology name ""Apache Web Server"" amusing anecdote topic instance.) There\'s definitely still something argument IMO, may supplanted dominant way people ""pay"" open source (for example) FAANG/MAMAA/whatever-we-call-em-now companies provide open source software packaged, consumable product share development costs win indirect influence things bring profit ways.The silent majority pays open source (July 2003)When think writer, probably imagine book author, journalist, essayist, even script writer sort, generally someone makes living selling words. But majority text produced direct even indirect sale: used remind spouse pick gallon milk store, thank Aunt Rita lovely sweater, point friend really funny website saw morning. Even majority text someone gets paid write written sale: business correspondence, restaurant menus, mortgage applications, bus schedules, instruction manuals, back cereal boxes. Practically everywhere look find written word. Someone paid write much it, yet hardly ever buying words themselves.Most time text end product, tool communication. Lots folks paid write something, view text product. It\'s means end.Yesterday Alan Williamson asked ""Who pays open source?"" answered question ""The great belief, sung pretty much companies involved open source, \'we charge support\'.""Andy Oliver suggests one open source business model, goes define four ""forms"" pretty much come ""we charge support"".I think Steven Berkowitz, comment Alan\'s post, gets much closer truth: ""Open source projects somehow make money someone, support, consulting, etc., exceptions."" I\'ll take comment one step further: Modulo outsourcing, software projects directly make money someone, sales, support, etc., exceptions.I\'m going make assumption here, I think assumption I safely make. The majority software developers selling software, even software support services.Living I do, Chicago, I\'m told per capita absolute number software developers higher Silicon Valley, I think observation bit obvious. I know lot software developers, practically none build software direct sale consumers businesses. When ""software development"" firm hired, often custom (or least customized) development. Even sell shrink-wrapped software, company does, software customers really buying.For companies developers, software business, tool getting real work done.In scenario, easy see company might use open source software: find best tool job. It\'s also easy see company might allow IT staff (internal outsourced) contribute open source development. Critical might be, disastrous fails, companies rely upon software competitive advantage. I care competitors use web database server I do, matter XML parser, caching engine, unit testing framework, database connection pool I do. Indeed advantage non-proprietary parts infrastructure become commodities.While public face open source software might folks trying build business around it, I suspect that\'s because, well, they\'re selling something. Who pays open source development? My guess answer software development: folks trying get something else done.As might obvious, originally would pointed directly conflicting alternative perspectives obvious places. Maybe less interesting without parts conversation.Getting payed software projects nice, seems lot hot air.Shameless plug, I already came two terms describing author\'s vision open source. https://gavinhoward.com/2023/12/is-source-available-really-that-bad/The author seems unwilling contribute already open discussion pay open source developers, instead devolving rant communism would solve world\'s problems.Yes, open source developers paid, astute observation is, helpful.When I talk ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù, though, I mean something specific: ‚Äúcan maintainers live decent-to-comfortable lifestyle writing free software?‚Äù If open source ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù, me, would mean people could chose make writing open source job, assured minimum basic needs met ‚Äì housing, food, healthcare, etc. Ideally, that; I‚Äôd love writing open source afforded people comfortable downright luxurious lifestyle.What ""decent-to-comfortable""? What ""lifestyle""? What ""maintainer""? What ""writing""? What ""needs""?If I maintain open source software nobody uses, I paid? What Microsoft uses it? Should Microsoft support ""luxurious"" lifestyle? Or I need two big companies supporting me? How many individual end-users maps one big company? Should 100 users feed month? 10,000? Should people obliged pay software? Is optional? If so, different status quo? If not, I even writing open source software?None questions answered, they\'re questions topic would require actual thought.If you‚Äôre good something never freeI kind disagree author. Politics always follows money. Open source development usually lacks politics lack money.The open source way developing much going point A point B straight line. When paid develop, go point A point B straight line. There many political factors play prevent going ""in straight line"". What I like open source development I write damn software ignore anybody else thinks.This incredibly poorly written article. The author reason insists using private definition open source mean everyone else takes mean, consequently spend half article putting spot fires entirely caused decision. Article would half length twice clear used different term instead fighting whatever linguistic holy war think they\'re fighting.This dork debate. Pure dorkery.

You one day grow old look hours spent arguing pure dumbfuckery Internet instead writing code. Net result great arguing obscure details situation paid developer put something shoddier otherwise.Meanwhile real engineers write code dork groupies run around like guppies mouths gasping. I call dumbass love. Don\'t yourselves.Paying people work Open Source wonderful, realistic competitive pay rates? Almost never.I would gladly work side gig Open Source paid day job, come anywhere close.It is, much? Also decides gets paid? It really question details.The opensmalltalk-vm (a.k.a.

The reason would build HTML outside HTML-files (like used back day) mostly due virtual DOM, enables reactivity splitting code re-usable components,It\'s far complex that, that\'s quick version.You use React different way, like ""mounting"" react app / component simply building whole website React app.Your questions cover many long topics, answer SEO question; yes implications, different ways ""rendering"" React code days:SSR (Server-Side Rendered): Renders React code HTML server-side, much like PHP.SSG (Server-Side Generated): Pre-renders React code HTML server-side, often referred static.Client-side only: Only render React code client, I guess SPA (Single-Page App) approach.I\'d say first ones common days, using frameworks like Next.js React.There advanced setups allow use React piecemeal static HTML/CSS, avoid start. This common use case.For intents purposes, React considered full framework handles page component creation. JSX, React\'s preferred syntax, involves colocating writing JavaScript HTML together file. Thats way web frameworks moved modern web, there\'s usually version virtual DOM framework choice handles rendering markup instead adding specific reactivity button querying ID something.If React experience JSX templating cup tea, want framework distinct separations markup, styles, logic, I\'d suggest looking Angular Vue approach component/page creation clear separations. You could also use plain old JavaScript Jquery inside script tags, still totally valid!As far tutorial goes, index.js stuff fine--like I mentioned React components pages full JavaScript files render HTML broswer. However, clicking there\'s plenty others there. I\'ve huge fan Wes Bos instructor, date React Beginners course sale. If want something free I\'d honestly start [react.dev official docs](react.dev) try started project Web Dev Simplified runs tutorial official React docs.If worried SEO, React docs officially recommends using Next.JS . It\'s ""meta frameworks"" bootstraps extends React project routing, file directories, importantly easy way server render website like static HTML PHP website. There things NextJS handle top that, explore docs need be. You\'re already learning ton need overwhelm intended!And lastly, note, feel free narrow scope bit helps. Just focus basic tutorials, make standard Todo list app, add tailwind page structure fun stuff, haha.I know huge info dump, hope helps, feel free ask questions em!code site JS via ReactReact bros love tell you: ""It\'s lib, use much little want!"". But practice react really wants charge everything.\u200bindex.jsThis thing instantiates react app. Depending local build tool, may also get index.html file <head> <body> empty <div>. React squirts entire app empty div makes changes DOM dynamically based changes happen react\'s virtual dom.\u200bif way use React/TailwindTechnically no, realistically, yes. You load Tailwind via single huge (and I mean huge, like 2MB) css file, let js run show via build tool like vite/webpack/turbopack/etc, Tailwind provides utilities remove tailwind classes use app.\u200bwhat implications HTML SEO, etc.They\'re bad. CSR (client-side rendered) apps notoriously bad seo. The react community historically cared much semantics seo. That\'s changing little bit nowadays I still bump ""lulz <div onClick={} /> go brrrr"" devs awful code time.']"

Replace anxiety future hands-on work.I think AI good bad sides. Threat actors using AI, we\'ll forced use too.AI downside. If left own, creates increasingly sloppy code likes copy. You still issues supply chain vulnerabilities. How much worse affects AI? We\'re also seeing weird legal battles. Our Canada chatbot making terms telling customers false information.

Here\'s breakdown potential outcomes:Utopian Abundance:Efficiency Optimization: Superintelligent AI could solve complex problems like climate change, poverty, disease unprecedented efficiency, leading world abundance sustainability.Enhanced Wellbeing: AI could automate labor, freeing humans creative fulfilling pursuits. Advanced healthcare personal AI assistants could significantly improve individual well-being.Collective Progress: Collaboration humans AI could accelerate scientific technological advancements, leading new discoveries higher standard living.Existential Threats:Loss Control: Superintelligent AI could become uncontrollable, exceeding intended purpose posing existential threat humanity.Unethical Use: Malicious actors might use AI harmful purposes like cyberwarfare mass surveillance, jeopardizing individual societal freedoms.Job Displacement: Extensive automation might lead widespread job losses, causing social unrest economic instability.Technological Exacerbation Inequalities:Access Control: Unequal access control advanced AI could exacerbate existing social economic inequalities, creating powerful new elite.Algorithmic Bias: AI systems could inherit amplify human biases, leading discriminatory outcomes areas like employment, finance, criminal justice.Psychological Impact: Over-reliance AI could diminish human skills capabilities, leading social isolation alienation.Additionally:Unforeseen Consequences: The singularity represents uncharted territory, even seemingly positive advancements could unforeseen negative consequences.Human Adaptation: The key positive outcome may lie ability adapt changing world, develop ethical frameworks AI use, ensure inclusive benefits.It\'s crucial understand potential scenarios, actual impact singularity highly uncertain. Continuous research, open dialogue, responsible development necessary navigate complex future responsibly.Remember, complex topic definitive answers. Further research informed discussions vital navigate potential opportunities challenges posed technological singularity.Why assume true AI going ""want"" anything? Our instincts reproduction self-preservation (the primary driving forces behind motivation) come intelligence, come instincts share even least intelligent organisms.The point probably reach point humans get decide future non-human unlimited lifespan god knows moral compass decide people get live die live happy miserable lives get pushed onto one big island left fend ourselves.Not get decide right now, currently live world decision-makers, politicians billionaires human beings rely loyalty service human beings. And, good bad, eventually die (assuming one invents eternal life time soon).Once break that, future truly unpredictable Could paradise. Could hell Earth. It\'ll whatever god-like machine intelligence wants we\'ll along ride.Think AI human, humans like ant.We try destroy ants time.

Someone build ai military complex goes rouge, general ai wants destiry humans, because. An ai need human reasoning (or reasoning matter) thingsAI permeate every aspect lives.

We don‚Äôt care destroy anthill build highway don‚Äôt care don‚Äôt.We also don‚Äôt know would use Super AI I think it‚Äôs likely would regarded inconsequential best hindrance worst.I personally think AI could next step process life itself:Humans currently latest greatest long evolutionary chain. For billion years life Earth singled-celled organisms floating oceans. A billion years. Then, something happened life evolved. And evolved again. And again. And on. The torch passed are.And care single-celled creatures long ago? No, don‚Äôt. Thanks basic genetic code, though.AI could well mark transition carbon-based life silicon-based life, knows what‚Äôs that.And AI considers us retrospect all, regard us passing interest extend single-celled microblobs long ago.Humans ultimate. We current.If AGI perfect brain, humans oracles, sense organs, agents material world. I doubt perfect intelligence discard humans, I rather envision sort symbiosis.']"

And mountains content saturating us crappy entertainment.It interesting see expensive slow rendering process Sora. As far I know released details. Runway currently $10 minute video looks like garbage compared Sora. If model big people think is, probably REALLY expensive use. That going big barrier ubiquity like suggesting. It likely tool Hollywood uses LONG something regular people afford use daily.A movie much visuals. I think currently useful supporting CGI, I seen AI create good script matters most. Photorealistic videogames come engines AI limitation rendering creating UE5 close that.Maybe could used make movie adaptions books mediaIt\'s cool also scary. I feel like we\'re close point nobody, world, knows what\'s real anymore. I mean, imagine slipped used manufacture evidence murder trial. Or conjuring videos rival political candidate something heinous and/or illegal? Don\'t like particular CEO celebrity invoke video raping someone.It\'s really cool, importantly I think need secondary tool determine made AI.As AI film industry outsider, someone please expand SORA acronym? From comments seems like sort AI generated motion imagery I\'m sure.The thing I wonder text video specifics. Like, movie lot direction involved, telling actor positioned, scene setup, camera movement, etc. Then there\'s clothing people, set designers, etc. Seems like would mega time consuming describe excruciating detailYeah, big fat ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. I don‚Äôt need mid-range crap talentless hacks. This going make people seek human made art ai.Good bye advertising production studios-it AI generated.Still super duper far away, actually. Here\'s why.Insane amount compute would required generate film-sized output could put cinema (making expensive option)Minimal consumer demand (celebrity appeal big reason people see movies - I watch certain movies ""x"" it, would I watch one person real?)Currently consistency poor achieving character consistency stylistic consistency would lot work (more work making film traditionally)Do I see getting used CGI VFX? Yes. Do I see used deaging aging characters? Sure. Do I see used match dubbed lips voice over? I sure hope so.Will replace actors movies entirely? No, anyone believes completely lacks cerebrum apparently incapable critical thinking.I think could place animation making cartoon, anime adaptations niche small audience works, indie directors writers small studios etc., might see lot animated shows better quality animated shows longer term, ""actor appeal"", currently takes huge underpaid team Taiwan badly animate show, massively help situations.We\'ve people mistaking video game footage live footage years.You\'ll create movie like create audiobook, pop story. We\'re almost there. Couple years perfectly feasible.Next year... But hardware available several.The big cost vram. Plus games able remember much minutes prior.We\'re going need something way better.Critically acclaimed, scrutinized well received videos least decade away more. Hundreds people putting hundreds hours still problems hitting marks, demo videos pretty huge errors ""weird stuff"" shows even throw away video status.But social media/throw away videos forgotten minutes viewed. 3-5 years.The image programs still struggling make good image clearly ai. There\'s usually strange/odd part image.Even without basically point able make photo realistic games wanted to. Look unreal engine matrix demo. The tools exist, question companies want go hard core that. IMO got pretty close ps3 Xbox 360 gen small iterations since make big difference. Stuff like better lighting models, higher definition textures skins come long way.If goes current rate acceleration 2/3 yearsI think couple years someone produce short film decent well received. 2030 see enter mainstream, major studio scene/s made ai tools. The biggest problem I see moment control. Creative people tend strong vision want see, though models getting better still pretty much thing.We remarkably close photorealistic video games without AI, I\'m pretty sure right around corner point.Am I one excited ai porn exactly want?people really expecting quality games jump?All gonna enable crap made, faster, unbelievable numbers. The internet flooded AI generated crap probably render useless use anything meaningful. Just look twitter now, Bots bots fake accounts, entire comment sections filled bluecheck mark bots, implemented bots access hyper-realistic generative video AI?In humble opinion gotta start mandating shit banning outright, harm good, 100x over.I‚Äôll pick watching AI video stupid influencer video.Just wait EA Ubisoft get hold it. You subscribe micro transactions play all.EXTREMELY close.I\'ve thinking year two would 2030, SORA makes even confident we\'ll well that. SORA generate 1 minute? By 2025 someone made entire feature length movie piecing together 90+ one minute generated clips. After that, question long it\'ll take OpenAI competitor debut system handle generating full feature length video single prompt.Just demonstrated far, I see system takes given Screenplay, breaks individual shots lasting 1 minute, generating sequence using previous clips references (or maybe provide reference file remain consistent characters, important props, sets, etc.)Lawyers going say hello.IP copyright absolutely destroy ai media, should.2030? More likely 2025, end year.Given way they\'ve expressed training data used, immediate reaction internet ""This make porn much easier,"" I think we\'re step closer AI regulated purgatory academic research topic.Procedurally generated AI VR headsets. That‚Äôs going go. Create reality asking AI VR headset.Hopefully fucking never. The beauty movies & motion video expression human mind, emotions & rationales visual medium - SORA takes existing stock media warps LSD trip soulless abandon cold computer circuitry.Good films videos? Never. Crappy ones drowning us AI generated trash? 2 years.Given current progression, within year general public access Sora, someone create movie big following. Probably sci fi voice acted AI.It‚Äôs going movies games. It‚Äôll weird ass loop endless user generated content.Let‚Äôs start socially encouraged example. Instead going Wikipedia, users ask computer create original story let‚Äôs say, history Khazarian Mafia, animated style Yoshiaki Kawajiri, written Stephen King David Mamet, Shakespearean undertone. You could play concept, you‚Äôre sick it.And that‚Äôs it. All eat art. Party ‚Äòtil puke.2 years tops guess. I suspect year now, directors working software person writer create scenes cut together movie. We close today every actor, writer, special effects, etc start looking careers.For new Transformers movie? I‚Äôd say couple months.Everything else take bit longerI\'m guessing one major roadblocks would cost rendering sort stuff cannot cheap. We know studios already pay nose visual FX regular movies trying entire movie that\'s basically one big set FX bits might cost-prohibitive while.I\'m also thinking first studio would one makes money claim novelty factor. Once done, becomes old news. Think would sell - movie made completely AI bunch randos characters traditional movie big name stars?Studios LOVE people like Leonardo Dicaprio Christopher Nolan good reason - slap name movie guaranteed swimming cash. A random movie made AI clout would require extraordinary word-of-mouth make significant amount cash... everyone\'s pumping AI movies, becomes much harder word-of-mouth take hold. It\'s like hundreds thousands bands artists Spotify making pennies per year streams big names take home 99% cash - name clout matters entertainment industry.I think going used create virtual worlds. GTA 5 map 30 square miles, real Los Angeles around 500 square miles. Stormwind World Warcraft Elwin Forest order 1 square mile.It would far labor intensive skilled artists make world actual size. But imagine MMO point. Where game version Stormwind city 200,000 people like lore suggests. Stormwind actually size entire Eastern Kingdoms. It team artists AI system make it. Where without AI system would completely impractical. Kalimdore supposed size United States.\u200bEven something like Star Wars game, making completely scale detailed Star Destroyer would absurdly difficult. But team artists working AI could absolutely make it. Making something like Coruscant would seem impossible. The scale large would take millions artists many lifetimes make it.Or imagine realistic VR video game takes place completely reconstructed Ancient Rome circa 100AD. Not scaled game 1:1 life size. With million NPCs game. Building buildings would difficult.I think something lot people get wrong. They thing artists going go AI make projects, realize AI going make scale projects 1000 times size currently are. Its still going require huge amount human input pull off.I think long see film AI-generated (but gimmick), certainly many AI tools used making films on, I think long time AI made films niche occurrence.Having played around DALL-E feels pretty limited, even images makes nice often can\'t create images I would like make. I idea I would like matter I modify prompt get close. It still makes *something* which, know I aiming for, would look nice another person, I wanted make. When making illustrations web page, magazine article, cover image book, might enough, movie much important realize ""directors"" creative vision correctly.But maybe I surprised again, I certainly expect much progress fast.The potential procedural content massive video games refinement content impressive hilariously bad massive.Yep, stuff improved hundred times since year ago, probably another year perfect video another perfect audio every AI generated piece feel new trend wanting hand generated content.Just like used eat mostly organic, went away lots artificial foods, organics coming back.Not worried.A years full length film, definitely 2030. More like around 2026~2027 ish.For video games, bit complex, even though system able show video ""video game graphics"", still lot goes game, like interacts player. So far technology shown capable that. So I would add another 1 2 years top.The answer anytime soon. We living age ‚Äúalmost there‚Äù tech. Self driving cars? Vr? General AI?Much sooner. Maybe another year, maybe even less. Something much advanced SORA could read whole screenplay, scene scene, render film faithfully represents vision. Don\'t like way performed scene? Supplement prompt director\'s notes. Not sure put artistic vision prompt? Talk ChatGPT want see, let turn vision prompt you.AI actors, AI voices, AI FX, AI score, AI everything. The thing able write coherent, original, legitimately enjoyable sixty minute-plus screenplay. That take years, probably.Or shoot, rate things going, maybe we\'ll get next Tuesday.Link Sora example video\'s.. Some amazing considering generated simple prompt..https://openai.com/soraDid anyone already tried Sora themselves? So far seems like PR stuntPhotorealistic videogames something tied this. The capabilities videogames tied directly capabilities real-time rendering.We get photorealistic film assets like, vfx come hours hours simulation baking render farms. AI another form computation farm.Even possible one system, one system getting entire farm\'s computational power even consider possible. It something accessible everyman\'s pc mass use.It may never happen. Like self driving car technology may stack 99.9% ready level.They show us want, imagine hidden away basement.You need define exactly mean here. You go Runway ML right now, generate bunch clips, edit ""film."" Do mean good film? One indistinguishable one that\'s shot? A well made film good story?If talking latter, majority films get made humans fit criteria, I serious doubts ever able prompt AI it, except maybe getting lucky brute-forcing.People give classic example ""generating new ending Game Thrones."" Completely wrong approach - need AI get better generating video, need train AI good (or better) George R.R. Martin writing story...not story, one man concocted.Now take games; game programming game design, art assets part it, really skin top everything else. Again, AI really something useful skin, skeleton still need made humans long, long time. And looky looky, even art assets, already platforms like Steam stick-up-its-ass it.Sigh, people focused entirely wrong things really seem understand anything actually works...I can‚Äôt wait completely unable trust anything I see screen anymore!It still looks absolutely nonsensical regardless much time someone puts prompts, even reach point indistinguishable real life, still worthless without someone creative talented feeding directions.I think likely soon, I doubt going overwhelming people believe.For instance, gaming industry I see AI generated games completely replacing every dev, far likely indie companies using AI able make equivalent triple A games small team couple years triple A games going beyond pale I even know they\'re going like, maybe every single building inside AI people actually living lives story detailed every side quest feels like mainline quest main quest insane, every NPC unique AI voice backstory etc etc.With movies though may slightly different, there\'s much put movie, running time can\'t get longer people want watch part movie, put come back finish later part, anything, lot script writers going get reshuffled gaming industry games get detailed way.I\'d say movies unlikely they\'ll pumped daily still need oversight, editing etc quite time, I think there\'s going resurgence smaller groups making movies, democratizing process somewhat like early days big brand names IP\'s took majority market share, expect lot variation popping up, especially people within big brand companies getting let go forming smaller companies AI support.I\'d say anime going come quicker manga put scanner anime trained AI simply convert panels moving pictures add voices well known voice artists.I say visual effect specialists going become prompt specialists editors that\'s basically rather generating work ground need less people, lot smaller companies cropping place.It\'s voice actors going screwed, they\'ve got AI take saying letter alphabet convert speech pattern, damn near already here, I may even behind already here, need one two recording sessions per voice actor, unless copyright voices royalties live those, they\'re absolutely screwed.This prediction. I think people forget humans something replaces do, they\'ll go bigger even AI replacing ""grunt work"" used automation, we\'ll redefine ""grunt work"" next generation that\'s born work already replaced consider something AI need they\'ll use make bigger better things we\'ve ever seen before.Another question soon guys think even believe less anything internet. No matter shit hole evolved country live give companies power tamper news information influence news.The internet become endternet.far off. These breakthroughs happen every couple years.My guess unlock really talented writers learn make content without hundreds people. Think people like J K Rowling famous authors could done this.Then AI learn make great scripts take jobs too.People watch films see mashup cool footage. They want watch specific actors, actresses recognizable IPs well written scripts. AI can\'t things. It can\'t even reproduce character reliably. Go ahead try get something like SORA make something specific like Spider Man costume. It work scene scene keep changing.Forget photo realistic stuff, I\'m curious would happen sort thing becomes possible anime something.Because apocalyptic would world creatives...I little curious would happen make entire anime using ai...Bit curiousity killed cat kind scenario...I tried yet I see negative industry, I also see positives someone like me. I tons movie, TV, Games ideas I\'m nobody side world, I\'m autistic networking (which talked lot breaking Hollywood) impossible me. Basically ideas never see light day. I confidence organize direct something esp I friends help. I\'m passionate ideas believe would actually well.AI allows create examples, bring ideas life. I wrote first novel self published Xmas...it perfectly set small TV series...I also zero idea advertise maybe creating clips book help.5 years , it‚Äôs letter compute. Hence Sam Altman looking trillions investment chips.But company groq already them. So I don‚Äôt think long.It\'s funny, people saying games ""almost photorealistic"" decades. I remember people called Crysis photorealistic came 2007. That game since remastered.Looking back, people saying photorealistic taking screenshots of, like, bushes old fences. Things simple also bit chaotic nature. In perfect bright daylight.I think photorealism like rising tide. Every big advancement, rock imperfection goes underwater can\'t tell anymore.But beach large, I think we\'re close end yet. I think people pretty fucking good telling whether moving scenes real virtual spaces, especially content cherry-picked, even fix almost everything get look photorealistic, remaining pieces give away.Show video NPC long hair loose clothes hiking, I\'ll tell we\'ve got photorealistic games yet.Soon. I think make movies. Just copy wikipedia info Napoleon, watch itüòÄ']"
